            "description": "The dataset of sun photometer observations was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental areas (N38°04′1.4″/E100°13′15.6″, 3414.41m) from Mar. 15 to Apr. 2, 2008 (to be specific, the daytime of 15-03-2008, 16-03-2008, 17-03-2008, 18-03-2008, 19-03-2008, 21-03-2008, 22-03-2008, 23-03-2008, 24-03-2008, 25-03-2008, 26-03-2008 and 27-03-2008). Those provide reliable data for retrieval of optical depth, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, column water vapor (through data in 936 nm) and with various parameters in 550nm, the horizontal visibility can be further developed by MODTRAN or 6S.\n     The optical depth in 1640nm, 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm, 550nm, 440nm, 380nm and 340nm were all acquired. Those data include the raw data in .k7 and can be opened by ASTPWin. ReadMe.txt is attached for detail. Processed data (after retrieval of the raw data) in Excel format are on optical depth, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. \n     Accuracy of CE318 could be influenced by local air pressure, instrument calibration parameters, and convertion factors. \n     (1) Most air pressure was derived from elevation-related empirical method, which was not reliable. For more accurate result, simultaneous data from the weather station are needed.\n     (2) Errors in instrument calibration parameters need correcting. Thus field calibration based on Langly or interior instrument calibration in the standard light is required.\n     (3) Convertion factors for retrieval of aerosol optical depth and the water vapor of the water vapor channel were also from the empirical method, and need further validation. \n     Raw data were archived in .k7 format and can be opened by ASTPWin. ReadMe.txt is attached for detail. Preprocessed data (after retrieval of the raw data) in Excel format are on optical depth, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. Langley was used for the instrument calibration.\n     Two subfolders including raw data and processed data (Geometric Positions and the Total Optical Depth of Each Channel and Rayleigh Scattering and Aerosol Optical Depth of Each Channel), and three data files (Directions on Data Observations, Raw Data and Proprocessed Data) were archived.",

It is utilized in data collection for atmospheric studies by capturing measurements that can be directly used to retrieve the optical thickness of non-water vapor channels, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical thickness, and the water vapor content in the atmospheric column. These measurements are conducted during daytime and are essential for understanding atmospheric conditions and visibility levels.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection using the CE318 sun photometer involves measuring optical thickness across various wavelengths and requires accurate calibration, which can be influenced by local atmospheric pressure, calibration parameters, and conversion factors. The Langley calibration method, used in this approach, aims to minimize atmospheric interference by tracking solar energy in stable atmospheric conditions. This is different from other spectrophotometric techniques that might use alternative calibration methods or be less dependent on environmental factors, potentially affecting their accuracy. The CE318's reliance on specific environmental conditions for accurate data highlights both a strength in precision under optimal conditions and a limitation when those conditions are not met.",

By analyzing these measurements, researchers can infer variations in atmospheric clarity and the potential impact of local weather patterns or pollution on visibility and radiation levels. This information is crucial for understanding how atmospheric conditions evolve over time in the specified geographic area and for validating atmospheric models.",

These include local atmospheric pressure, calibration parameters of the instrument, and various conversion factors. During data preprocessing, atmospheric pressure is usually derived from empirical relationships related to elevation, which may not accurately reflect reality. To achieve precise retrieval results, synchronous meteorological station data is required. Calibration errors in the instrument parameters need to be addressed through field or indoor calibration. Field calibration involves obtaining measurement data with atmospheric quality numbers between 3 and 7 under stable atmospheric parameters using the Langley principle. Indoor calibration uses a standard light source. Furthermore, the conversion factors used in retrieving aerosol optical thickness and water vapor content in the water vapor channel are empirical parameters whose practicality requires further validation.",

                    "Answer": "Calibrating a solar spectrophotometer, such as the CE318 used in the field, involves both outdoor and indoor calibration processes. Outdoor calibration is conducted under stable atmospheric conditions, where the atmospheric mass number ranges between 3 and 7, using the Langley principle. This involves measuring the solar direct energy voltage values without atmospheric influence. Indoor calibration involves using a standard light source. Additionally, it is crucial to correct for local atmospheric pressure using empirical relationships tied to elevation, although these may not always be accurate. Instrument calibration parameters require adjustment through field or lab calibration, and conversion factors need verification to ensure they are practical for deriving aerosol optical thickness and water vapor content.",

Outdoor calibration involves using stable atmospheric parameters and obtaining measurements with atmospheric mass numbers between 3-7, applying the Langley principle for calibration. Indoor calibration requires the use of a standard light source to verify instrument calibration parameters. Additionally, obtaining precise atmospheric pressure data from synchronous meteorological station readings and validating empirical conversion factors also contribute to improving calibration accuracy.",
