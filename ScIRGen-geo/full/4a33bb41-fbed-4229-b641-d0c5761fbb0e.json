            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of 40m tower vortex correlator on January 1, 2017, solstice, 2017, December 31, 2017.The station is located in east garden town, huailai county, hebei province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7923E, 40.3574N, and the altitude is 480m.The acquisition frequency of vortex correlativity instrument is 10Hz, the frame height is 3.5m, the ultrasonic direction is due to the north, and the distance between the ultrasonic anemometer (CSAT3) and the CO2/H2O analyzer (EC150) is 0cm.\nThe released data is the 30-minute data obtained from the post-processing of the original collected 10Hz data with Eddypro software. The main steps of the processing include: outfield value elimination, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output after processing was also screened :(1) the data when the instrument was wrong was removed;(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation were excluded;(3) the missing rate of 10Hz original data is more than 10% every 30min;(4) the observed data of weak turbulence at night were excluded (u* less than 0.1m/s).The average period of observation data was 30 minutes, 48 data a day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.There are many negative values of water vapor density measured by EC150 in winter, filled with -6999.\nThe observation data released by vortex correlator include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (K), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), the length of cloth hoff, sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest are 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.The data was missing during the period from May 26 to May 29 due to instrument calibration.\nGuo et al, 2020 is used for site introduction and Liu et al, 2013 for data processing.",

                    "Answer": "The Eddy Covariance method is a data collection technique used to measure and analyze the exchange of gases, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, between the earth’s surface and the atmosphere. It involves the use of instruments like ultrasonic anemometers and gas analyzers to capture high-frequency turbulence data, typically at 10Hz, which is then processed to derive fluxes over a 30-minute average period. The method requires post-processing steps such as despiking, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic virtual temperature correction, and density correction. Data quality is assessed through tests for atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity.",

                    "Answer": "Implementing strict data filtering criteria, such as excluding instrument error data, precipitation data, and weak turbulence observations, can significantly enhance the quality and reliability of the dataset. This process helps ensure that only accurate and relevant data are analyzed, minimizing noise and potential biases in the results. Consequently, these measures can lead to more precise and insightful analytical outcomes, allowing for better understanding and interpretation of meteorological and surface flux dynamics.

This approach aims to understand the microclimate dynamics, assess the impact of different land surfaces like irrigated maize fields, and evaluate the quality of flux measurements through various correction methods such as coordinate rotation and frequency response correction.",

Additionally, quality assessments of flux values are conducted, focusing on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data is also filtered by removing data with instrument errors, data around precipitation events, data with high missing rates, and nighttime data with weak turbulence. The processed data is then evaluated and categorized into quality levels based on these assessments.",

The data is processed using Eddypro software, which applies techniques like coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and density corrections to refine data collected at a frequency of 10Hz into 30-minute intervals.",
