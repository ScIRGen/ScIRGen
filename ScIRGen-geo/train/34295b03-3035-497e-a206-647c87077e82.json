            "description": "The data of insects and other arthropods in Kekexili area of Qinghai Province are from the comprehensive scientific investigation of Kekexili area from May to August 1990. The central area of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, known as the \"roof of the world\", is Kekexili area. Due to its high terrain, sparse vegetation, low air temperature and less rainfall, its insect fauna is extremely unique, which is a Typical Alpine insect fauna. Because of the high altitude, cold climate, low air pressure, lack of fresh water, no roads and extremely bad natural conditions in Hoh Xil area. From May 1990 to August 1990, more than 4000 specimens were collected, including ten orders of Insecta: Collembola, Ephemeroptera, zhenptera, trichophaga, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and fleas, and three other classes of invertebrates, such as Branchiopoda and labiopoda Chilopoda and Arachnida. In Insecta, Diptera is the most, followed by Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. It provides a reference for the following research.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format and contains 9 workbooks, which are 1. The number and proportion of each order of insects; 2. Genera, species, new genera and new species of related families of Insecta; 3. Genera, species, new genera and new species of related families of other arthropods; 4. Analysis of faunal composition of insects; 5. Analysis of faunal composition of other arthropods; 6 9. The spines of the giant gallstone centipede. The table gives a detailed description of the number and proportion of insects collected by each order in Hoh Xil area, as well as the analysis of genera, species, new genera and new species of related families, as well as the floristic composition of other insects.",

This region, characterized by its high elevation, sparse vegetation, low temperatures, and limited precipitation, presented unique challenges for data collection. The survey involved collecting over 4000 specimens of insects and other invertebrates, including various types of insects such as Collembola, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Siphonaptera, as well as other invertebrates from the classes Branchiopoda, Chilopoda, and Arachnida. The Diptera was the most abundant order collected, followed by Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, providing a reference for future research.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection from the Qinghai Hoh Xil region indicates that the insect fauna is highly specialized due to the extreme conditions of high altitude, cold climate, low pressure, and sparse vegetation. The predominance of Diptera, followed by Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, suggests that these orders may have specific adaptations to survive in harsh environments. This could include physiological adaptations to cold temperatures, behavioral strategies to cope with low oxygen levels, or dietary adaptations to limited food resources. Understanding these adaptations can provide insights into the evolutionary pressures faced by these species in high-altitude ecosystems.",

The area is a typical high-cold insect fauna, and the focus was on capturing a representative sample of the unique and diverse insect population, which included orders such as Diptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and others.",
