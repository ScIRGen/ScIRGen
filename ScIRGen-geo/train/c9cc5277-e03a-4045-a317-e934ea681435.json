            "description": "The water level observation data set of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau contains the daily variations of water levels for three lakes: Zhari Namco, Bamco and Dawaco. \nThe lake water level was obtained by a HOBO water level gauge (U20-001-01) installed on the lakeshore, then corrected using the barometer installed on the shore or pressure data of nearby weather stations, and then the real water level changes were obtained. The accuracy was less than 0.5 cm.\nThe items of this data set are as follows: \nDaily variation data of water level in Zhari Namco from 2009 to 2014;\nDaily variation data of water level in Bamco from 2013 to 2014;\nDaily variation data of water level in Dawaco from 2013 to 2014.\nWater level, unit: m.",

This goal influences data collection by necessitating the use of HOBO water level loggers installed on lake shores to capture precise measurements. The data correction is achieved through calibration with atmospheric pressure data from shore-based barometers or nearby meteorological stations, ensuring an accuracy of less than 0.5 cm in the recorded water levels.",
