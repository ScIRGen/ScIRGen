Tree cover also affects habitat quality and movements of wildlife, residential property value for humans, and numerous other ecosystem services. Importantly for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and to foster conservation and sustainable management of forests (REDD), tree cover provides a measurable attribute upon which forest cover may be defined. Further, changes in tree cover over time can be used to monitor and retrieve site-specific histories of forest disturbance, succession, and degradation."

Across all biomes and types of reference data, these independent assessments found that saturation of the optical signal, phenological noise, and confusion with dense herbaceous vegetation led to errors in the MODIS VCF between 10/C131% Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), over-estimation in areas of low cover, and under-estimation in areas of high cover."
