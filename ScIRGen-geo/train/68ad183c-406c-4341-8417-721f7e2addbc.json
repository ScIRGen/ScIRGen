            "description": "The dataset of sun photometer observations was obtained in the Zhangye city foci experimental areas (38°56′8.9″N, 100°27′8.3″E, 1400m) from Mar. 30 to Apr. 2, 2008. \n     Measurements were carried out by CE318 for 1640nm, 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm, 550nm, 440nm, 380nm and 340nm, and column water vapor by 936 nm data on Mar. 30 and 31, Apr. 1 and 2, 2008. \n     Accuracy of CE318 could be influenced by local air pressure, instrument calibration parameters, and convertion factors. \n     (1) Most air pressure was derived from elevation-related empiricism, which was not reliable. For more accurate result, simultaneous data from the weather station are needed.\n     (2) Errors from instrument calibration parameters need correcting. Thus field calibration based on Langly or interior instrument calibrationcin the standard light is required.\n     (3) Convertion factors for retrieval of aerosol optical depth and the water vapor of the water vapor channel were also from empiricism, and need further checking. \n     Raw data were archived in k7 format and can be opened by ASTPWin. ReadMe.txt is attached for detail. Preprocessed data (after retrieval of the raw data) in Excel format are on optical depth, rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. Langley was used for the instrument calibration.\n     Two parts are included in CE318 result data (see “Geometric Positions and the Total Optical Depth of Each Channel” and “Rayleigh Scattering and Aerosol Optical Depth of Each Channel”).",

It involves recording the voltage corresponding to the received solar energy at different atmospheric masses, and using these data points to determine the instrument's calibration parameters. This method is particularly useful for minimizing atmospheric interference in the measurements.",

                    "Answer": "Inaccuracies in measuring aerosol optical thickness and water vapor content using sun photometers can be attributed to local atmospheric pressure discrepancies, errors in instrument calibration parameters, and empirical conversion factors. Specifically, atmospheric pressure used during data preprocessing is often derived from elevation-related empirical relationships that may not reflect actual conditions, necessitating concurrent meteorological station data for precise results. Instrument calibration errors require outdoor calibration under stable atmospheric conditions or indoor calibration with a standard light source. Additionally, the empirical conversion factors used in retrieving aerosol optical thickness in water vapor channels need further validation for practical applicability.",

These measurements help in assessing Rayleigh scattering, aerosol characteristics, and water vapor content in the atmosphere. Additionally, the data can be used to derive parameters at 550nm, which, with the aid of software like MODTRAN or 6S, can determine horizontal visibility. This information is vital for accurately modeling and predicting atmospheric conditions.",

Outdoor calibration involves acquiring measurements under stable atmospheric conditions where the atmospheric mass number is between 3-7, using the Langley principle for calibration. Indoor calibration requires a standard light source. (2) The data preprocessing phase involves correcting atmospheric pressure using empirical relationships related to elevation, which may not always match actual conditions. To achieve precise inversion results, synchronized meteorological station data is necessary. (3) Conversion factors used in the inversion of aerosol optical thickness and water vapor content are empirical and need further validation for practical application.
