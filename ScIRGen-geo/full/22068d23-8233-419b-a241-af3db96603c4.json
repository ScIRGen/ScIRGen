The time range of the data set is from 1982 to 2015. In order to remove the noise in NDVI data, maximum synthesis and multi-sensor contrast correction are carried out. A NDVI image is synthesized every half month. The data set is widely used in the analysis of long-term vegetation change trend. The data set is cut out from the global data set, so as to carry out the research and analysis of the source areas of the three rivers separately.\nThe data format of this data set is GeoTIFF with spatial resolution of 8 km and temporal resolution of 2 weeks, ranging from 1982 to 2015. Data transfer coefficient is 10000, NDVI = ND/10000.",

                "The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments has been crucial to study a variety of global land vegetation processes and how they vary in time. Although AVHRR sensors were not originally intended as a climate mission, their early success for vegetation studies was due to a reconfiguration of the instruments to have non-overlapping (“visible”) channel one (0.58–0.68 µm) and (near-infrared) channel two (0.725–1.10 µm) spectral bands. Since spectral vegetation indices are a surrogate for photosynthetic potential, the long record of AVHRR NDVI data has become particularly relevant for continued long-term monitoring of land surface. However, the difficulties in processing AVHRR NDVI data are to properly deal with several limitations of the AVHRR instrument or operation, e.g., vicarious post-launch calibration, atmospheric and cloud correction, and bias correction for the systematic orbital drift during the life of the individual TIROS-N missions. Among-instrument calibration is a prerequisite to observing and documenting the land variability and it is particularly challenging for the AVHRR because, by design, the instrument does not have fully onboard calibration for the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) channels and must rely on external references."

Orbital drift of the NOAA-7 to NOAA-14 satellites carrying AVHRR/2 instruments adds to the challenge since the NOAA satellite overpass times drifted from the nominal 1:30 pm overpass time by as much as 4.5 hours toward evening, creating variable illumination and view angles."
