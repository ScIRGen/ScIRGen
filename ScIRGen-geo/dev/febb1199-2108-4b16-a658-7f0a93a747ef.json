            "description": "Extreme water level data is from GTSR data sets, GTSR is the first data set of reanalysis of storm surge and extreme water level based on the hydrodynamic model. We simulate the storm surges and extreme water level between 1979 and 2014, covering the global coastlines. Working with the foreign team won the 1979-2014 China along the coast, the maximum value of the results of numerical simulation.Based on GTSR data sets, by using the extremum theory model, with five kinds of extreme value theory model and sampling method we calculate extreme water level risk assessment, respectively as follows: gevr1: GEV distribution of annual maximum fitting (annual maximum, AMAX);Gumr1: Gumbel distribution on the observed annual maximum water level fitting (GUM department - AMAX);Gevr10:10 GEV distribution on each year to take extreme value (r = 10 / yr) fitting in turn;GPD98: beyond the threshold method take percentile for 98% line GDP fitting;GPD9975: beyond the threshold method take percentile was 99.75% line GDP fitting. This data is made up for the shortcomings of tide site discontinuity. It can intuitively show the Chinese coast high flood risk areas and can be used for the coastal high risk assessment and risk area defined later.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of coastal flood risk assessment, an 'extreme value theory model' refers to a statistical approach used to evaluate the probability of extreme events, such as high water levels, based on historical data. This involves fitting models, like the GEV (Generalized Extreme Value) distribution or GPD (Generalized Pareto Distribution), to observed or simulated extreme values to estimate the likelihood of rare events, such as centennial flood levels, aiding in the assessment of flood risk along coastlines.",

                    "Answer": "The different extreme value theory models each use different approaches to estimate extreme water levels. GEVr1 fits a GEV distribution to annual maximum values, while GUMr1 uses a Gumbel distribution for observed annual extreme water levels. GEVr10 fits a GEV distribution to the top 10 extreme values per year. GPD98 uses the peak-over-threshold method with a 98th percentile threshold, and GPD9975 uses a 99.75th percentile threshold for GPD fitting. These methods offer varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity in capturing extreme events, which can influence flood risk assessment outcomes along the Chinese coast.",

                    "Answer": "The use of hydrodynamic models and extreme value theory allows for a more comprehensive and continuous assessment of coastal flood risks by addressing the limitations of discontinuous tidal gauge data. The temporal coverage from 1979 to 2014 and the spatial coverage along global coastlines, including China's, enhance the reliability of these assessments. The application of multiple extreme value models provides a robust evaluation framework, which can better identify areas of high flood risk and support future coastal risk assessments and high-risk zone delineation.",

This dataset, which simulates storm surges and extreme water levels from 1979 to 2014 globally, provides a comprehensive analysis of annual maximum values and various percentile thresholds. The objective is to compensate for the discontinuity of tide gauge stations and to visually identify areas with high flood risk, which can be used for subsequent coastal risk assessment and high-risk area delineation.",

The data for China's coast is then analyzed using five extreme value theoretical models and sampling methods: gevr1 utilizes the GEV distribution to fit annual maximum values, gumr1 utilizes the Gumbel distribution for annual extreme observed water levels, gevr10 fits 10 extreme values per year using the GEV distribution, GPD98 employs a threshold exceedance method with a 98% percentile for GPD fitting, and GPD9975 uses a 99.75% percentile for GPD fitting. This approach addresses the discontinuity in tidal gauge data and aids in visualizing areas of high flood risk along China's coast for subsequent risk assessment and high-risk zoning.",
