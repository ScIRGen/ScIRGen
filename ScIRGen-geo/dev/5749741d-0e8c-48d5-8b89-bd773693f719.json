            "description": "This data set includes grid emission inventories of atmospheric mercury in 2019 in China's third polar region (Tibet, Xinjiang, Yunnan and Qinghai). The emission inventory comes from the emission inventory database of the research group of Professor Wang Shuxiao of Tsinghua University. The emission inventory is processed into a 0.3125°*0.25° grid dataset by using ArcGIS software technology. The basic data of emission calculation is calculated by the emission factor method based on public data collection, satellite observation data and literature collection. The data are from the data of the National Bureau of statistics and the statistical yearbook of other industries, and its quality can be guaranteed. The emission inventory data can provide a better understanding of mercury emissions in the pan-third polar region and can be used as model input data for further study of air quality in the pan-third polar region.",
