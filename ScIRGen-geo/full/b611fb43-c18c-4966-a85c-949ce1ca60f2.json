            "description": "Soil moisture is the key variable of water and energy cycle, but the long-term, high-resolution soil moisture data with high accuracy is still relatively lacking on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Therefore, we provide the 1 km seamless daily soil moisture data over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during 2001-2020 (named as BTCH). Firstly, several predictors including the vegetation index (NDVI and EVI), land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration, precipitation, topography (DEM, aspect, slope, TWI), soil properties and three soil moisture related indices (SWCI SIWSI VSDI) were utilized. Five machine/deep learning methods including the artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), residual neural networks (ResNet), the long short-term memory network (LSTM) and XGBoost were trained for each year taking the ESA CCI soil moisture data as target. Then the Bayesian three-cornered hat method was adopted for model integration and the final dataset was generated. Evaluaion against four in-situ measurement networks shows that the BTCH dataset has relativey high accuracy both as station and network scales with mean unbiased RMSE values of 0.048 m3/m3 and 0.034 m3/m3. The dataset can be used for various regional hydrological, meteorological, ecological analysis and modeling.",

                "Soil moisture (SM), defined as the total amount of water within the unsaturated zone, is a key state variable in water cycle and energy budgets of land ecosystem, controlling the process of evapotranspiration, influencing the partitioning of infiltration and runoff, and governing vegetation water uptake, thus having an essential role in weather forecasting, drought monitoring and water resource management. Accurate and detailed information of the spatiotemporal distribution of SM would therefore greatly improve our understanding of the land-atmosphere system. However, due to the complex and unique geographical environment, detailed seamless soil moisture information with high precision and high resolution over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is still severely lacking. Generally speaking, ground observation can provide precise estimation of soil moisture but are costly and labor-intensive, and also have poor spatial representation for neighboring areas due to its high spatial heterogeneity. While, remote sensing, especially microwave remote sensing becomes the most promising tools in mapping regional to global soil moisture owing to the direct relationship between the electromagnetic radiation, soil dielectric and water content and the better penetrating capability of microwaves. Nevertheless, microwave soil moisture products usually have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers. Such soil moisture products are only suitable for potential applications at continental and global scales but fail to meet regional application requirements such as water resource management, drought monitoring, precipitation/evapotranspiration estimation and precision agriculture."

Then, six machine learning models were constructed taking the SMAP soil moisture data as target, and the corresponding downscaled surface soil moisture was generated. A Bayesian-based three-cornered hat (BTCH) merging method was subsequently applied to obtain the final downscaled surface soil moisture. Finally, the performance of each downscaled SM and merged downscaled product was evaluated using ground-based measurements and inter-compared."

While the artificial neural network (ANN) outperformed other approaches in the northwestern areas. Validation against in-situ measurements showed that compared with SMAP SM, the MATCH SM exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error with mean R and ubRMSE values of 0.55 and 0.047 m3/m3. The mean R and ubRMSE values for SMAP SM were 0.67 and 0.056 m3/m3, respectively. In addition, the MATCH SM presented great improvement compared with any single downscaled SM data, having the highest correlation and the lowest ubRMSE scores. While, among different methods, the highest R was 0.50 (GBDT) and the lowest ubRMSE was 0.052 m3/m3 (residual network (ResNet)). Besides, the downscaled SM could accurately reflect the temporal variations of soil moisture and precipitation, and effectively represent the spatial patterns of soil moisture. Satisfactory downscaling results were achieved in arid and semi-arid areas whereas a certain degree of overestimation still existed in the eastern and southeastern regions with dense vegetation and high moisture conditions. Such overestimation was inherent from original SMAP SM but was mitigated after downscaling. In conclusion, performance differences existed among diverse downscaling approaches and the developed MATCH method could maximize the potentials of each method and show encouraging downscaling performances."
