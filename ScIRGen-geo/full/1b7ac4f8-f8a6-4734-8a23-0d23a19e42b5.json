            "description": "Soil moisture is an important boundary condition of earth-atmosphere exchanges, and it has been defined as an essential climate variable by GCOS. Vegetation optical depth is a physical variable to measure the attenuation of vegetation in microwave radiative transfer model, and it has been proved to be a good indicator of vegetation water content and biomass.\nThis dataset uses the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA) to retrieve both soil moisture and polarized vegetation optical depth with SMAP brightness temperature. The algorithm uses a self-constraint relationship between land parameters and an analytical relationship between brightness temperature at different channels to perform the retrieval process. The MCCA does not depend on other auxiliary data on vegetation properties and can be applied to a variety of satellites. The soil moisture product from this dataset includes the soil moisture content in the unfrozen period and the liquid water content in the frozen period. Both horizontal- and vertical-polarization vegetation optical depth are retrieved. So far as we know, it is the first polarization-dependent vegetation optical depth product at L-band.\nThis dataset was validated by 19 dense soil moisture observation networks (9 core validation sites used by SMAP team and 13 sites not used by them), and the widely used soil climate analysis network (SCAN). It was found that ubRMSE (unbiased root mean square error) of MCCA retrieved soil moisture is generally smaller than that of other SMAP products.",

Microwave remote sensing has good capability to retrieve SM and VOD, especially passive microwave L-band (1 – 2 GHz) because at these wavelengths the vegetation is semi-transparent, and the observed brightness temperature (Tb) is sensitive to the water content of the first few centimeters of the soil surface, and absorption and scattering have lower impacts, compared to shorter wavelengths. Current L-band passive microwave sensors on Earth-orbiting satellites include the European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, launched in November 2009 with multi-angular and full-polarized observations and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, launched in January 2015 with full-polarized observations at an incidence angle of 40°.

The self-calibrating of Rou was carried out under two extreme conditions. For the first condition, which was assumed a smooth surface, the following procedure was followed: (1) Rou was initially set to 0 globally. Using the MCCA algorithm, 201 pairs of SM and VOD at H and V polarizations were retrieved for a range of ω from 0 to 0.2 with a step of 0.001. The bin size for DoI calculation was determined using all the 201 pairs of time series SM and H-polarized VOD. The ω value corresponding to the minimum DoI was selected as the result. (2) With the ω value obtained from step (1), 451 pairs of time series SM and VOD were retrieved using MCCA for Rou values ranging from 0 to 4.5 with a step of 0.01.
