Nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for plant growth, and their availability can significantly impact the restoration of plant communities and soil health. Additionally, by using isotope tracing and experimental ecological methods, researchers aim to quantify how these nutrients are absorbed by dominant plants and utilized by soil microorganisms, which helps in understanding the nutrient dynamics and their influence on plant-soil-microbe interactions during the restoration process.",

This method provides detailed insights into how these nutrients are absorbed by dominant plants and utilized by soil microorganisms, thereby enhancing the understanding of nutrient dynamics. Such information can reveal the intrinsic mechanisms by which nitrogen and phosphorus influence the nutritional composition of dominant plants, ultimately aiding in the development of balanced production and adaptive management strategies for restoring alpine grasslands in ecologically fragile regions.",
