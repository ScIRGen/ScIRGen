            "description": "Based on the regional environment integrated system model developed by the Key Laboratory of regional climate and environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, a regional climate model for convective analysis of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is established.\nThe grid center of the model simulation area is located at (34n, 100e), the horizontal resolution is 3km, and the number of simulation grid points of the model is 465 (longitude) x 375 (latitude). The vertical direction is 27 floors. The air pressure at the top of the model layer is 50 HPA. The buffer zone consists of 15 grids, the integration time is one year in 2010, and the horizontal resolution of the European medium range weather forecast center is 0.25x0 25. The reanalysis data of era5 with a time interval of 6 hours is used as the driving field to generate the driving data of surface meteorological elements on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau in 2010 with a horizontal resolution of 3 km * 3 km and a time interval of 1 hour\nAfter dynamic downscaling by using the convection analysis regional climate model of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, the bottleneck problem of the lack of meteorological data sets with long-time series and high spatial-temporal resolution in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and other regions is solved, so as to provide a solid and reliable scientific data foundation for the future change of climate and environment and the construction of ecological security barrier in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

Vertically, it is structured with 27 layers, with the top layer at a pressure of 50 hPa, and includes a 15-grid wide buffer zone. The integration time covers the entire year of 2010. The model uses ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as the driving field, which has a horizontal resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 and a 6-hour time interval. This setup allows the model to dynamically downscale the data, addressing the lack of long-term, high spatio-temporal resolution meteorological datasets in regions like the Tibetan Plateau.",
