            "description": "Water scarcity，food crises and ecological deterioration caused by drought disasters are a direct threat to food security and socio-economic development. Improvement of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management is now urgently required. This article describes major scientific and technological progress in the field of drought disaster risk assessment. Drought is a worldwide natural disaster that has long affected agricultural production as well as social and economic activities. Frequent droughts have been observed in the Belt and Road area, in which much of the agricultural land is concentrated in fragile ecological environment. \nThe percentage of precipitation anomaly is the percentage of the precipitation between a certain period of time and the average climate precipitation of the same period divided by the average climate precipitation of the same period.Based on the daily rainfall data of GPM IMERG Final Run(GPM), this data set calculates the precipitation of the corresponding region, adopts the evaluation index of precipitation anomaly percentage grade, and analyzes the distribution characteristics of drought of different grades.\nThe data area is 34 key nodes of the pan-third pole (Abbas, Astana, Colombo, Gwadar, Mamba, Tehran, Vientiane, etc.).",

                    "Answer": "The precipitation anomaly percentage is calculated by comparing the precipitation of a specific period with the average precipitation over the same period in previous years. This percentage provides a quantifiable measure of deviation from the norm, which can be used to assess the severity of drought conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The methods for collecting and processing precipitation anomaly percentage data in this field involve using GPM IMERG Final Run daily rainfall data to calculate precipitation levels. The process includes evaluating precipitation anomaly percentages by comparing current precipitation with climatic averages. Challenges include ensuring data accuracy across varied geographic locations like the 34 key nodes in the泛第三极, and dealing with spatial and temporal variations in precipitation data, which can affect the reliability of the drought distribution analysis.",
