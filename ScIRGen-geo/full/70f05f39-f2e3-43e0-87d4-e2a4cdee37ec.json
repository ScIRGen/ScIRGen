                    "Answer": "The data collection using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) focuses on detecting subsurface features such as soil moisture and freezing depth through radar wave reflection. Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measures soil moisture by evaluating the dielectric constant of the soil. The combination of GPR and TDR techniques provides comprehensive data, with GPR offering spatial coverage and TDR providing point-specific moisture content. The use of both methods on different dates and locations suggests a complementary approach to enhance data reliability and accuracy in detecting soil conditions in cold regions.",

This is due to the ability to cross-validate and calibrate GPR data with direct measurements from TDR, reducing uncertainty and enhancing the reliability of the inversion models used.",
