The downscaling bias-corrected models perform good in climatic simulation for China, and the VIC model forcing by observed meteorological dataset perform well in the historical runoff simulation. This dataset can be useful for the research about China’s future water resources change under mid (SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) warming scenarios.",

                "The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6) indicates that the Earth’s mean temperature has increased by 1.1°C relative to the preindustrial revolution period of 1850–1900 and that the rate of increase in global surface temperature in the period of 1970–2020 is greater than that in any 50-year period prior to 2000. Large amounts of greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are a primary cause of global warming (IPCC, 2021); furthermore, elevated CO2 concentrations cause plant stomata to close, leading to reduced transpiration and thus affecting river flows (Gedney et al., 2006). Studies have shown (Skliris et al., 2016) that a 1°C increase will affect the hydrological cycle, amplifying the ambient humidity at a rate of 3–4%. Global climate models (GCMs) can describe in detail the changes in atmospheric motion, heat exchange, and sea-land-air-ice interactions over time (Gleick, 1989) and are effective tools for studying the effects of historical, present, and future atmospheric changes on surface physical processes (Gonzalez et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2015). Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) has improved the simulation of temperature and precipitation in the China region compared with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (Jiang et al., 2020); specifically, the dry bias is significantly reduced in southern China (Zhu et al., 2020). CMIP6 is based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of CMIP5 (van Vuuren et al., 2011) and proposes the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (Riahi et al., 2017), which can reflect newer and more diverse greenhouse gas concentration changes under social development (O’Neill et al., 2016). However, the spatial resolution of GCMs is coarse, and downscaling bias correction is usually required for finer-resolution basin-scale hydrological model simulations, where statistical downscaling is more widely used than dynamical downscaling due to simpler calculations and more reliable results (Ahmed et al., 2013).",
                "The downscaling methods of GCMs mainly include dynamic downscaling and statistical downscaling. Although the former has clear physical meaning, it is more computationally intensive, while the latter is relatively easy to calculate and can correct the statistical bias of the GCMs with better results, so it is widely used in research regarding the impact of climate change at the regional scale (Sun et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016; Xu and Wang, 2019). Teutschbein and Seibert (2012) used different statistical methods to correct the precipitation and temperature of regional climate models for five mesoscale basins in Switzerland and found that the method based on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) was the most effective. Based on this result, Li et al. (2010) proposed the equidistant cumulative distribution function method (EDCDFm), which corrects the CDF of the GCM variables to be consistent with the measured data in the historical period, and the GCM output of the future scenario is corrected according to the difference between the CDF of the GCMs historical period and the measured data. The study shows that EDCDFm can effectively capture the extreme values of climate elements and improve the accuracy of the GCMs and model simulation after downscaling.",
                "Generally, a value of NSE closer to 1 indicates that the simulation results are better, and an NSE less than 0 indicates that the simulation results are unreliable. The NSE of monthly streamflow between simulations and observations is at or above 0.60 at each station (Table 2), suggesting that the VIC model is more applicable to hydrological simulations in China."

We use the bias-corrected precipitation, temperature, and daily mean wind speed to drive the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model, and study the changes in multiyear average annual precipitation, annual evapotranspiration and total annual runoff depth relative to the historical baseline period (1985–2014) for the Chinese mainland, basins and grid scales in the 21st century future under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.",

The CDF was calculated by referring to the paper (Watterson, 2008; Li et al., 2010), where the probability density function (PDF) of temperature was estimated using a four-parameter beta function, the PDF of precipitation was estimated using a mixed gamma distribution function, and the parameters were estimated using the 1979–2014 series for the historical period and the 2015–2100 series for the future period.

                "In summary, the hydrological station monthly streamflow based on CMFD and VIC model simulations had small errors and strong correlations with the observation streamflow in all basins, and the VIC model and CMFD driver used in this study performed well in the Chinese mainland (Table 2).",
                "The monthly streamflow simulated by the CMFD-driven VIC model and CaMa-Flood model has NSEs of 0.6 in the YR and Huai basins and NSEs of 0.7–0.9 in other study basins, indicating that the VIC model hydrological simulation is applicable in the Chinese mainland. The hydrological projections of the single GCM data at the basin scale have large uncertainties. The multi-GCM arithmetic ensemble mean reduces the uncertainty of GCM projections. Under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the future water resources in the Chinese mainland and each basin are likely to increase, and the decrease in annual runoff is likely to occur mainly in the northwest and southwest regions, which can provide a strong scientific reference for future water resource management and risk analysis in China under climate change."
