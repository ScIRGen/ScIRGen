            "description": "The Qinghai Tibet Plateau is known as \"the third pole of the Earth\". The long-term and large-scale observation data of permafrost is of great significance to understand the changes and effects of Permafrost on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (QXP). Especially in such a cold and anoxic area, the extreme shortage of data resources greatly limits the development, improvement and validation of various remote sensing inversion algorithms, as well as the earth system simulation and scientific research of the QXP. In the past few decades, our research team has established a synthesis network in the permafrost region of the QXP. For the first time, the database systematically integrates the long-time series observation data of 6 automatic meteorological stations, 12 active layer sites and 84 boreholes. In the process of data collection and processing, all observation data have been strictly controlled. The data set will be released to scientists with multi-disciplinary backgrounds (e.g., cryosphere, hydrology, ecology and meteorology), which will greatly promote the validation, development and improvement of hydrological model, land surface process model and climate model of the QXP.",
            "instructions": "File naming: the data of automatic weather station, soil moisture and temperature of active layer and borehole temperature are stored in Excel format, and the file names are “Meteorological dataset.xlsx”, \"Active layer of ground temperature.xlsx\", \"Active layer of soil moisture.xlsx\" and“Ground temperature dataset.xlsx”.\nData reading mode: all the table files in the data set can be opened with EXCEL program, and the main contents are site, date and observation element values of different depths.",
