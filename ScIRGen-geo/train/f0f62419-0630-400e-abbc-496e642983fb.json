China's 1:100000 land use data is constructed in three years based on LANDSAT MSS, TM and ETM Remote sensing data by means of satellite remote sensing, organized by 19 research institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the national macro survey and dynamic research on remote sensing of resources and environment, a major application project of the eighth five year plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Using a hierarchical land cover classification system, this data divides the whole country into six first-class categories (cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, urban and rural areas, industrial and mining land, residential land and unused land), and 31 second-class categories. This is the most accurate land use data product in China, which has played an important role in the national land resource survey, hydrological and ecological research.",

Land-cover change is closely related to the terrestrial surface material cycles and life-support processes, i.e., the interaction between biosphere and atmosphere, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycle and sustainable exploitation of resources. The series of scientific study programs, issued and promoted by IGBP and IHDP in 1995, make the study of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) become one of the hot topics in the global environmental change study. As a developing but booming country, China has formulated a series of policies exerting great influence on the land-use change. In addition, due to varied physical environments and vast land areas, its land-use changes not only influence the social and economic development but also impact the global change accordingly."
