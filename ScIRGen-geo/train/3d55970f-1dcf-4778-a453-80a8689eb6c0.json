            "description": "Ostracods from the Silurian Pulu Formation in the Yalai West II section, Nyalam (GPS coordinates: 28°24′3.52″N, 86°5′55.08″ E) and the Devonian–Carboniferous transitional interval in Xainza (GPS coordinates: 31°4′ 11″N, 88°41′08″E) are described for the first time. The methodology, known as ‘hot-acetolysis’, was used to extract ostracods from the limestones. About 1050 and 2460 specimens were obtained, including both single valves and carapaces from the Yalai west II section, Nyalam and Chaguoluoma DCB section, Xainza, respectively. In the Yalai West II section, thirty-two species belonging to 19 genera are identified and figured, and the ostracod fauna indicates an age of the late Llandovery Pridoli for the Pulu Formation. At the stratotype section of the Chaguoluoma Formation, Xainza, fifty-three ostracod species of 19 genera are identified and figured including a new species Bairdiacypris xainzaensis n. sp. The ostracod fauna in the Chaguoluoma section may represent an age close to the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary. New findings of ostracods fauna have great significance for biostratigraphy subdivision ad correlation. This dataset include identification lists from the Yalai West II and the Chaguoluoma sections.",

                    "Answer": "'热酸解法' refers to a method used to extract microfossils, such as ostracods, from rock samples. It involves the use of heat and acid to dissolve the surrounding matrix to isolate and retrieve the fossil specimens, which is particularly useful for detailed paleontological studies such as those conducted on the Silurian and Devonian-Carboniferous boundary layers in the specified locations.",

                    "Answer": "The successful identification and extraction of ostracod fossils in these geological layers are influenced by the use of methods like the 'hot acid dissolution' technique, which is effective in retrieving ostracod shells from sediment samples. Additionally, the precise location of the sites (like the coordinates provided for Nyalam County and Xainza County) are critical for accessing these specific stratigraphic units. The discovery of a diverse assemblage of 19 genera and 32 species in Nyalam's Silurian Pulu Formation and 19 genera in Xainza's Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, including a new species Bairdiacypris xainzaensis, suggests that the stratigraphic context and fossil preservation conditions are also crucial factors.",

                    "Question": "What are the consequences on the understanding of biostratigraphy when using the 'hot acid method' to extract ostracod fossils from geological formations in Tibet?",
                    "Answer": "Using the 'hot acid method' to extract ostracod fossils from the geological formations in Tibet allows for the identification of diverse ostracod assemblages, which in turn reveals key biostratigraphic information such as the age and environmental conditions of the Silurian and Devonian-Carboniferous boundary layers. The identification of new species and genera, as found in the study of the Xainza County, can enhance the understanding of biological assemblages and their stratigraphic significance.",

                    "Answer": "Ostracod fossils are extracted from sedimentary rock layers using a 'hot acid method.' This involves treating the rock samples with acid to dissolve the matrix and release the fossil shells. In the specific context of the research in Tibet, the method yielded 1050 and 2460 ostracod shells from two different sections. The identification process further classified these into various genera and species, revealing their stratigraphic significance and age, such as the Silurian to Devonian-Carboniferous boundary.",
