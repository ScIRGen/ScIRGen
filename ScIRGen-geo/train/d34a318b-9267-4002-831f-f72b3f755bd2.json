Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates our in-house climatology,Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model,It is based on the previous \"intelligent\" interpolation technique and the high resolution, long time recorded precipitation estimation method based on infrared cold cloud duration (CCD) observation CHPclim, 0.05° resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. Finally, the  InfraRed Precipitation data of all 34 key nodes of pan-third pole region are produced. This data set serves as the research basis for all remote sensing data and provides baseline data for the project. This dataset can be updated in real time according to the official or government information of the node.",
