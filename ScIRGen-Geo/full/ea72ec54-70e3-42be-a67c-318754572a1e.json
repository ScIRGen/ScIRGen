      "description": "This dataset includes Iran brGDGTs data.  we present the first report of the brGDGT distributions in 48 surface soils along a pronounced mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient from northern Iran and compare these with an updated global dataset. Our results indicate that: (i) the distribution pattern of soil brGDGTs in northern Iran is dominated by non-cyclopentane-containing compounds, which is characterized by a higher fractional abun\u0002dance of Ia and IIa′ and lower abundances of IIa and IIIa compared to those in adjacent regions (i.e., Xinjiang and Tajikistan), owing to the relatively higher soil pH and temperatures; (ii) the cyclopentane-containing brGDGT Ib and IIb′ show positive correlations with MAP, and 6-methyl brGDGT IIa′ and IIIa′ are negatively related to MAP in alkaline soils from both northern Iran and other regions. This differs from the pH dependency of these brGDGTs in global acid soils; (iii) the Cyclisation of Branched Tetraethers ratios (CBT5ME and CBT6ME) are \nnegatively correlated with MAP in northern Iran, which can be potentially used for regional MAP reconstructions and a series of CBT5ME- and CBT6ME-MAP calibrations and multiple linear regression-based MAP calibrations are proposed. Notably, we assume that the correlation of MAP with 5-methyl brGDGTs (e.g., IIa) in northern Iran \npartly accounts for the inaccurate temperature estimation derived from the methylation index (MBT′5ME).

      "descriptionCn": "本数据集包括伊朗brGDGTs数据。首次分析了伊朗北部48个表层土壤中brGDGT沿明显的年平均降水（MAP）梯度的分布，并将其与最新的全球数据集进行了比较。结果表明：（1）伊朗北部土壤brdgts的分布格局以非环戊烷类化合物为主，由于土壤pH和温度相对较高，与邻近地区（新疆和塔吉克斯坦）相比，其Ia和IIa′的分数丰度较高，而IIa和IIIa的丰度较低；（2）在伊朗北部和其他地区碱性土壤中，含环戊烷的brGDGT Ib和IIb′与MAP呈正相关，6-甲基brGDGT IIa′和IIIa′与MAP呈负相关。这与全球酸性土壤中这些brdgts的pH依赖性不同；（3）在伊朗北部，支化四醚比率（CBT5ME和CBT6ME）的环化与MAP呈负相关，这可能用于区域MAP重建，并提出了一系列CBT5ME和CBT6ME-MAP校准和基于多元线性回归的MAP校准。",

In the context of the field, the dominance of non-cyclopentane compounds in brGDGTs in northern Iran soils, which have relatively high pH and temperature, results in a higher fractional abundance of Ia and IIa′ and a lower abundance of IIa and IIIa compared to neighboring regions. This indicates that brGDGT distribution can provide insights into the soil's chemical and thermal environment.",
