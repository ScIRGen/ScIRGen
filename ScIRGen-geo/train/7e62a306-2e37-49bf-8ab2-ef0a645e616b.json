            "description": "This data belongs to U-Pb geochronology data of Mesozoic strata in Huanghua depression, Bohai Bay Basin, inner North China Craton, including Pb, 232Th, 238U contents, 207Pb / 206Pb, 207Pb / 235U, 206Pb / 238U ratios and errors, 207Pb / 235U, 206Pb / 238U ages and errors, etc. Zircon U-Pb dating was carried out by using the second upgraded excimer laser ablation system (geolas HD, 193nm wavelength) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quadrupole (Agilent 7900). The laser frequency is 5Hz and the beam size is 30 nm μ m。 The international standard sample 91500 was used as the external calibration standard for age calculation. Nist610 was used to calculate the concentrations of uranium, thorium and lead, and gj-1 was used to monitor the isotopic ratios \u0002 The U-Pb isotopic ratios were calculated by cal10.8, and the common Pb was corrected by compb # 3-18. The age of particles younger than 1000mA is based on their 206Pb / 208U ratio. The analysis with > 10% or < – 5% inconsistencies was excluded. The acceptable inconsistencies and accuracies of the analysis were listed in the table below. The harmonic age and the mean age were calculated by isoplot software. The uncertainty of the mean age was 2 σ,  The individual analysis report is 1 σ。 The results of geochronology data are published in Science China earth science, and the data quality is reliable. It plays a very important role in the establishment of Mesozoic stratigraphic framework in Bohai Bay Basin covered by Cenozoic. It lays a good foundation for Mesozoic tectonic evolution and basin analysis in this area, and has a good application prospect.",

                    "Answer": "Zircon U-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS as described involves using a second-generation excimer laser ablation system and quadrupole ICP-MS for precise dating. The method utilizes external calibration standards like the international standard 91500 for age calculation and NIST610 for concentration calculations, providing reliable data with age uncertainties reported as 2σ for average ages and 1σ for individual analyses. The analysis excludes discrepancies greater than 10% or less than -5%, ensuring data consistency. This method is particularly effective for establishing the Mesozoic stratigraphic framework in the Bohai Bay Basin, offering a reliable basis for tectonic evolution analysis compared to other methods that may not provide the same level of precision or suitability for this geological context.",

                    "Answer": "Zircon U-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS involves several procedural steps: First, zircon samples are prepared and analyzed using a GeoLas-HD excimer laser ablation system with a 193nm wavelength and an Agilent 7900 quadrupole ICP-MS. The laser frequency is set to 5Hz with a beam size of 30μm. International standard 91500 is used for external age calibration, and NIST610 is used for calculating uranium, thorium, and lead concentrations, while GJ-1 monitors isotope ratios. The U-Pb isotope ratios are computed using ICPMSDATACAL10.8, and common Pb correction is made with ComPb Corr#3-18. The age of grains younger than 1000Ma is based on their 206Pb/238U ratio, excluding analyses with >10% or <–5% discordance. Acceptable discordance and precision are specified, and concordia ages and mean ages are calculated with ISOPLOT software, reporting mean age uncertainty as 2σ and individual analysis as 1σ.",
