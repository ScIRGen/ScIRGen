                "As land surface models (LSMs) for use in numerical weather prediction models (NWPs) and Earth system models (ESMs) become more sophisticated, they need more detailed information on physical and chemical properties of soil, including information on how soil properties change with depth in the soil and across geographic areas. The soil datasets now used in global land modeling were derived from the FAO/UNESCO (Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) world soil map (1:5 million) and limited soil profile data. The development of these data sets used little data from the China national soil surveys in 1950s and later. The soil map data and soil attribute data of the sampled profiles are two source databases for developing the spatial soil property dataset. The soil map is composed of mapping units, and each mapping unit is composed of soil units. Chinese scholars have developed two schemes, the Genetic Soil Classification of China (GSCC) and the Chinese Soil Taxonomy (CST) classification. However, most soil profile information in China has been referenced to the GSCC, which was used in the Second National Soil Survey of China. Soil profiles have commonly been used to assign measured properties to each classification element (soil map unit), i.e. using “taxotransfer rules” that ignore the spatial variability within map units. The Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) is a newly released global soil dataset available for land modeling use. It was established by combining existing regional and national updates of soil information, in particular, the Soil Map of China at 1:1 million. The HWSD only incorporates the Soil Map of China, but not the abundant soil profile information. This paper describes the development of the China soil characteristics dataset for use in land models in NWPs/ESMs. This effort is unique in that, for the first time, the China NWPs/ESMs community will have access to a dataset of physical and chemical properties of soil specifically designed for modeling applications."

However, most land surface models require soil texture data in the FAO-USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) System. Soil profiles differ from each other in terms of number, sequence, thickness and depth to the top and bottom soil layers. In addition, not all the layers have data for all soil characteristics. About three fourths of the soil profiles have a depth less than 1 meter, and 90% of them have a depth less than 1.5 meters. The soil map provides a horizontal pattern of soil type information but soil profiles provide a vertical variation of soil characteristics at point locations. There is no spatially continuous information of soil properties. Many land surface models require uniform grid cells or raster format, while map units of the 1:1 million soil map of China are defined as polygons in a vector format."

The soil type linkage method and the soil polygon linkage method were used to derive the spatial distribution of soil characteristics. The soil type linkage method was accomplished by linking soil map units (soil types) and soil profiles according to taxonomy-based pedotransfer rules. The soil polygon linkage method works by linking a soil polygon with several closest soil profiles that have the same soil type and texture classes as the soil polygon. The linkage procedure, as described by Shangguan et al. [2012], incrementally enlarges the search radius for profiles until the target sample size is reached."
