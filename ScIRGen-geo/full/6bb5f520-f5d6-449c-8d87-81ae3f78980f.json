                "Small proteins specifically refer to proteins consisting of less than 100 amino acids translated from small open reading frames (sORFs), which were usually missed in previous genome annotation. The significance of small proteins has been revealed in current years, along with the discovery of their diverse functions. Genome annotation is fundamental to life science. In recent years, it has been found that small open reading frames (sORFs) widely exist in genomes of many organisms including humans and human microbiomes, and some are able to be translated into small proteins. Small proteins are proteins with less than 100 amino acids, which may be derived from untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs or non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). Small proteins were usually missed in previous coding sequence annotation, while their significance has been revealed in current years for diverse functions, such as embryonic development, cell apoptosis, muscle contraction, and antimicrobial activity. Despite the abundance of sORFs in genome, the number of well-studied small proteins is very limited. Annotation of numerous small proteins will contribute to studies on various physiological and pathological processes. Identification of small proteins at proteomic level is challenging. Mass spectrometry (MS) can provide direct evidence of small proteins, but it relies much on the coverage of existing libraries, which mainly focus on large proteins rather than small proteins. Ribosome profiling (also named as ribosomal footprinting or Ribo-seq) provides a more sensitive way for global detection of translation events based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs), which allows for identifying the location of translated ORFs and translation initiation sites (TISs), the distribution of ribosomes on mRNA, and the speed of translating ribosomes. Emerging evidence shows that many upstream ORFs (uORFs) act in cis to regulate the translation of downstream ORFs by leaky scanning, reinitiation, and ribosome stalling. Given the great importance of small proteins, in-depth investigations of small proteins across various species are in need."

                "The fastq files of 547 Ribo-seq datasets were downloaded from GEO and ENA databases. Each dataset was checked manually to confirm the sequencing adapters. The adapters were removed using cutadapt 1.18 and only reads with 25–35 bp in length were retained. Then the sequences were mapped to the latest genome using STAR 2.5.2a using EndToEnd mode with allowance of up to 2 mismatches. Ribo-seq quality and P-site offsets were assessed by Ribo-TISH quality module. Manual checks were then carried out to verify offset values and eliminate datasets without obvious triplet periodicity. After the quality control, 419 Ribo-seq datasets were retained. Translated ORFs were predicted by Ribo-TISH predict module. Minimum amino acid length of candidate ORFs was set to 5. For datasets containing TI-seq data, alternative start codons were included (--alt), and different parameters were set for LTM-based TI-seq and HARR-based TI-seq (--harr). sORFs with less than 100 amino acids were filtered from the prediction results above. In-frame reads of sORFs were counted and normalized by library sequencing depth (in-frame total reads count) and sORF length. Variants were called individually in each sample using the HaplotypeCaller tool. Variants with QualByDepth (QD) < 2 were removed using VariantFiltration tool. Disease-specific translation events as well as disease-specific SNVs of small proteins in 16 types of diseases were identified."

                    "Answer": "The identification of small proteins at the proteomic level is challenging due to the reliance on existing mass spectrometry libraries that primarily focus on larger proteins. Additionally, small proteins often lack protease cleavage sites because of their limited length, are usually of low abundance, and tend to be filtered out during the enrichment process.",

                    "Answer": "Small proteins are often missed in genome annotation because they are translated from small open reading frames (sORFs) that were not traditionally included in previous genome annotations. These sORFs can be located in untranslated regions (UTRs) or non-coding RNAs, such as primary microRNAs, long ncRNAs, and circular RNAs, which were not the focus of earlier annotations.",

                    "Answer": "Variability in ribosome profiling data quality and reliability can arise from the manual checking process to confirm sequencing adapters, the removal of adapters using specific software, and the mapping of sequences to the latest genome which allows for mismatches. Additionally, quality control measures, such as evaluating Ribo-seq quality and P-site offsets, as well as manual verification of triplet periodicity, contribute to variability. The retention of only high-quality datasets after these checks further impacts the reliability of data used for predicting translated ORFs.",

The sequences are then mapped to the latest genome using STAR 2.5.2a in EndToEnd mode, allowing for up to 2 mismatches.
