            "description": "The borehole is about 7km away from Jiagedaqi City （50.47°N, 124.23°E), located in a wetland with about 80cm-thick peaty soil. There are three boreholes, and one is 2m away from the pipe center and 20m deep, the second is 16.6m away and 20m deep, and the third is 50m away from the second pipeline and 60 m deep. Based on the temperature borehole with a diameter of 40 mm and depths of 20 to 60 m, the ground temperature along the China-Russia Crude Oil Pipeline was measured using the thermistor sensor, which was assembled by State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soil Engineering, and calibrated with an accuracy of ±0.05℃. Therefore, the critical characteristic parameters such as ground stratigraphy, temperature of permafrost, surface temperature and active layer thickness were obtained. During the period from October 2014 to October 2017, ground temperatures in the T1 and T2 boreholes were collected manually. The ground temperatures in T3 was collected automatically and continuously since 12 June of 2018. Then the continuous and complete record of ground temperature data uploaded to the specified server (fixed IP address) by the wireless transmission module utilizing cellular networks. From these measured data along the China-Russia Crude Oil Pipeline route, the development characteristics and historical evolution of permafrost, and its response to the climate change can be analyzed.",

This is especially the case for long-distance linear pipeline infrastructure in permafrost regions because of the harsh environment, which causes more frost hazards, higher sensitivity of permafrost to temperature change, and the complex interaction between the pipeline and permafrost. Monitoring systems were established along several pipeline routes in permafrost regions in the world, such as the Norman Wells pipeline in Canada, the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the U.S., and the Nadym–Pur–Taz natural gas pipeline in Russia, to obtain field data for understanding how the permafrost foundation would perform when a pipeline went through or above it. In addition, a real-time monitoring system is especially important for the safe operation of pipeline engineering, which not only accumulates valuable field data revealing the complicated pipeline–permafrost interaction, but also monitors the operational status of the pipeline and the possibility of various frost hazards on the pipeline to provide early hazard warnings."
