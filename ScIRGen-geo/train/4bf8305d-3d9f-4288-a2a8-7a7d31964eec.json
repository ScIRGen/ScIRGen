                    "Answer": "Studies of small counties have been limited by difficulties of data collection and its methodological problems, all of which bring about modification of production function back to a local input-output (IO) model. The reasons may include economic and geographical diversities among provinces, empirical weighted coefficients easily making huge deviation from the actual economic structure, and even more difficulties of data collection in a rural county.",

This approach is comprehensive but may face limitations due to aggregation from 144 sectors to 12 sectors at the county level, potentially affecting the representation of the economic structure.",

                    "Answer": "Missing statistical records with a time lag can affect the reliability of an input-output table as they necessitate modifications of the production function to a local model, which may lead to deviations from the actual economic structure. This is further complicated by the lack of available time series data and the necessity of interpolation methods to address these gaps.",
