            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the A'rou flight zone on Jul. 7, 2008. Due to cloud/cloud shadow influence, atmospheric correction could not be performed, and geometric registration was performed manually instead of automatic matching. Level-2B (after radiometric and manual geometric corrections) and mosaic images were available for users. For the visible near infrared band the resolution is 1.25m, Radiance was recorded (W/ (sr•m^2•nm);DN=Radiance*100000); for TIR band, the brightness temperature was recorded (℃; DN=Brightness_Temperature*100) .\n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id\n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 6#1 || 1500m || 13:43:18 || 13:46:26 || 48  || incomplete || incomplete\n|-\n| 2 || 6#3 || 1500m || 13:52:26 || 13:55:18 || 43  || incomplete || incomplete\n|-\n| 3 || 6#5 || 1500m || 13:59:30 || 14:02:38 || 48  || incomplete || incomplete || A’rou freeze/thaw observation station\n|-\n| 4 || 6#7 || 1500m || 14:08:02 || 14:11:02 || 46  || incomplete || incomplete\n|}",
