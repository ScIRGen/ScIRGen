            "description": "The 0.1 º aerosol optical thickness dataset (also known as the \"Poles AOD Collection 1.0\" aerosol optical thickness (AOD) dataset) in the polar regions from 2000 to 2020 was produced by combining Merra-2 mode data and MODIS satellite sensor AOD. The data covers the period from 2000 to 2020, with a daily time resolution, covering the \"tri polar\" (Antarctic, Arctic and Qinghai Tibet Plateau) region, and a spatial resolution of 0.1 degree. The verification of the measured stations shows that the relative deviation of the data is within 35%, which can effectively improve the coverage and accuracy of AOD in the polar region.",
