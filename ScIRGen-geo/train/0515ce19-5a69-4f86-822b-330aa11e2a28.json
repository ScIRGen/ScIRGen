            "description": "Under the funding of the first project (Development of Multi-scale Observation and Data Products of Key Cryosphere Parameters) of the National Key Research and Development Program of China-\"The Observation and Inversion of Key Parameters of Cryosphere and Polar Environmental Changes\", the research group of Zhang, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed the snow depth downscaling product in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The snow depth downscaling data set for the Tibetan Plateau is derived from the fusion of snow cover probability dataset and Long-term snow depth dataset in China. The sub-pixel spatio-temporal downscaling algorithm is developed to downscale the original 0.25° snow depth dataset, and the 0.05° daily snow depth product is obtained. By comparing the accuracy evaluation of the snow depth product before and after downscaling, it is found that the root mean square error of the snow depth downscaling product is 0.61 cm less than the original product. \n     The details of the product information of the Downscaling of Snow Depth Dataset for the Tibetan Plateau (2000-2018) are as follows. The projection is longitude and latitude, the spatial resolution is 0.05° (about 5km), and the time is from September 1, 2000 to September 1, 2018. It is a TIF format file. The naming rule is SD_yyyyddd.tif, where yyyy represents year and DDD represents Julian day (001-365). Snow depth (SD), unit: centimeter (cm). The spatial resolution is 0.05°. The time resolution is day by day.",

                "Accurate remotely sensed snow depth (SD) data are essential for monitoring and modeling hydrological processes in cold regions. While the available passive microwave SD data have been widely used by the community, the coarse spatial resolution (typically at 0.25°) of these data impedes the explicit representation of the hydrological processes in snow-dominated regions, especially in mountainous regions with complex terrain. Snow is a key component of the hydrological cycle and an important indicator of climate change. It also plays a key role in the energy balance because of its strong effect on the surface albedo and soil temperature, thereby modulating the local and regional weather and climate. The snowpack can store a large amount of the precipitation that falls during the cold season, it also plays a vital role in the spring runoff formulation, impacting the downstream agricultural production, which relies on irrigation. The snow depth (SD) is the most important variable that describes the amount of snow for a given region. Several approaches have been extensively used to monitor the SD, including field observations, land surface modeling, optical remote sensing, and passive microwave remote sensing."

The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a spatiotemporal downscaling method by taking advantage of the spatial information of the MODIS SCP and the temporal information of the passive microwave SD during an 8-day period to produce a finer resolution (i.e., 0.05°) SD product across the TP; (ii) to determine whether the accuracy of this newly-developed 0.05° SD product is better than that of the previous coarse-resolution SD dataset; and (iii) to investigate the spatial and temporal variations in SD over TP during the last two decades."

            "challenges": [
                "The coarse spatial resolution of such SD products is not adequate for hydrological modeling studies in small watersheds where the runoff is often simulated at the kilometer scale. The development of high-resolution (both spatially and temporally) remote sensing SD data in the Tibetan Plateau is challenging because of its heterogeneous landscape and scarce ground observations. Although the SD dataset was improved, with a better resolution of 0.05°, the error of the representativeness is inevitable when validating pixel-based SD products based on ground-based SD measurements."

The new advanced SCP dataset was generated by combining MODIS Terra and Aqua data for 2002–2018 at a spatial resolution of 0.05° over the entire TP. If the pixel was completely (100%) covered by clouds during the entire 8-day period, the spatial probability of snow cover was estimated using the cloud-free spatial probability of snow cover for the preceding 8-day period (PSCP) and that of the following 8-day period (FSCP). Using the ratio of daily SD to the 8-day SD sum, the daily temporal weight can be calculated to improve the temporal resolution of the 8-day SD sum dataset containing subpixel spatial information."

Based on this 0.05° SD product, we found that higher SD values are mainly distributed on the southeastern and eastern TP as well as the Himalaya and Karakoram, while much lower SD values occur on the inner TP. During 2000–2018, the TP-averaged annual SD showed a slight (p > 0.05) increasing trend because there were little changes in SD for most grids across the TP. The newly-developed 0.05° SD product could facilitate our understanding of the hydrological processes on the TP through a more explicit representation of the gridded-based snow water information."
