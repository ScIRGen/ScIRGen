            "description": "1) This data is the reconstructed autumn sea ice from 1289 to 1993 in Barents Kara Sea, Arctic ; 2) Based on  multiple statistical methods modeling, this sea ice time series is reconstructed by the  ice core and tree ring proxy record; 3) This long term sea ice series is  annual resolution and have a high reliability; 4) This data can help us know the  historical changes of Arctic sea ice and its response and impact on climate change. The Barents Sea Kara Sea area is the key sea area where the extreme cold air flows southward in winter and spring in China. However, the lack of observation data limits our understanding of its mechanism. It is very important to reconstruct the characteristics of long-term Arctic sea ice change to study the Arctic sea ice change in the global context and its impact on China's historical climate.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using ice core samples involve analyzing physical and chemical properties preserved in ice layers, which can provide high-resolution data on past climates. In contrast, tree ring proxy materials rely on the growth patterns of trees, which can reflect climatic conditions over time. Both methods are used to reconstruct historical sea ice extents, but ice cores tend to offer more direct climatic insights, while tree rings can provide broader regional climate information. Both methods involve statistical modeling to achieve a high level of accuracy in the annual resolution data, contributing to a better understanding of the long-term changes in Arctic sea ice and its implications for climate variations.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating data from ice cores and tree rings, along with using various statistical modeling methods, has led to the reconstruction of a time series for the Arctic Barents-Kara Sea's autumn sea ice extent from 1289 to 1993. This high-resolution dataset enhances our understanding of historical Arctic sea ice changes and their response to climate change. It is particularly relevant for studying the impact on China’s historical climate, as the Barents-Kara Sea region is crucial for extreme cold air outbreaks in China's winter and spring. The reconstruction helps overcome the limitations posed by the lack of observational data, thereby aiding in the exploration of Arctic sea ice variation and its broader implications under global climate change contexts.",

This knowledge is significant for studying Arctic sea ice changes in a global context and understanding its effects on China's historical climate, especially since the Barents-Kara Sea region is a key area influencing the southward movement of extreme cold air during China's winter and spring seasons.",
