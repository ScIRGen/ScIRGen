This facilitates the development of data products related to meteorological elements, lake water volume and quality, above-ground vegetation biomass, and glacier permafrost changes. Additionally, integrating IoT technology helps in real-time data acquisition, remote control, and data sharing, thereby enhancing research and decision-making processes.",

                    "Answer": "Meteorological data is collected through field observations at 21 different stations in high-altitude regions such as the Tibetan Plateau. The data includes parameters like temperature, precipitation, wind direction and speed, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, radiation, and evaporation. The observations are conducted on-site and recorded in Excel format. The data is processed to ensure a daily resolution for each station. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the data is subject to validation through intensive observation and verification at key regions and sample points. This helps in creating comprehensive datasets that are later used to develop data products related to meteorological, hydrological, and ecological factors.",
