            "description": "The content of this data set is the measurements of body weight and body size (body height, body length, chest circumference, tube circumference) of 11 representative yak populations in Qinghai pastoral area at 2018. All the metadata comes from the work of body weight monitoring of yaks in Qinghai pastoral area at 2018, by the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Qinghai Academy of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences. The data set is named by “Monitoring Data Set of Body Weights of Traditional Grazing Yaks in Qinghai Pastoral Area (2018)”, consisting of 11 worksheets. The names and contents of worksheets are as follows:\n1. Haiyan-Halejing (167 yaks in halejing Mongolian Town, Haiyan County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 2. Qilian-Mole (69 yaks in Mole Town, Qilian County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 3. Qilian-Yeniugou (42 yaks in Yeniugou Town, Qilian County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 4. Qilian-Yanglong (104 yaks in Yanglong Town, Qilian County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 5. Qilian-Ebao (28 yaks in Ebao Town, Qilian County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 6. Tianjun-Xinyuan (38 yaks in Xinyuan Town, Tianjun County, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 7. Tianjun-Longmen (100 yaks in Longmen Town, Tianjun County, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 8. Gande-Ganlong (36 yaks in Ganglong Town, Gande County, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 9. Guinan-Taxiu (70 yaks in Taxiu Town, Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 10. Henan-Kesheng (73 yaks in Kesheng Town, Henan Mongolian Autonomous Country, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture); 11. Ledu-Dala (50 yaks in Dala Town, Ledu District, Haidong City).\nThis data set comprehensively evaluates the growth performance of yaks grazing in alpine meadow under the current ecological environment through the measurement of weight and body size data in the representative areas of Qinghai pastoral area. The data set can be compared with the growth characteristics of representative populations of Qinghai yaks measured in 1981 and 2008 recorded in 1983 and 2013, and the degradation index of growth performance of yaks grazing in Qinghai pastoral area can be obtained, which is helpful to assess the impact of ecological environment changes on the growth and production performance of grazing livestock.",

These partnerships facilitate access to representative yak groups across various regions, ensuring comprehensive data collection on weight and body measurements. This collaborative approach also helps in evaluating the impact of ecological conditions on yak growth performance over time.",
