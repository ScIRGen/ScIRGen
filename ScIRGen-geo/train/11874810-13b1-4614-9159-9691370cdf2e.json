The data set is mainly prepared for disaster and risk assessment. Due to the huge coverage, the geomorphic data adopts 150m spatial resolution and other data adopts 1000m spatial resolution. Geomorphology, vegetation index, temperature and rainfall data are mainly produced by processing open source data, and disaster bearing value grade data are produced by superposition calculation, comprehensively considering population data, night light index, buildings and surface cover types.",

                "Spatially interpolated gridded climate data, here referred to as 'climate surfaces', are used in many areas of work, particularly in the environmental, agricultural and biological sciences. For many applications, data at a high (≤1km2) spatial resolution are preferred to capture environmental variation that can be lost at lower spatial resolutions, particularly in mountainous and other areas with steep climate gradients. Hijmans et al. (2005) provided climate surfaces, referred to as the ‘WorldClim version 1 database’, for global land areas (excluding Antarctica), consisting of long-term average monthly temperature and precipitation. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of climate stations for which data is available, including a number of stations located at high latitudes and elevations. Furthermore, while the original dataset was limited to monthly precipitation and temperature, we also included solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure, which may be necessary to model important processes such as plant growth. Estimates for regions where weather station density (or quality) is insufficient to resolve local gradients may be improved using remotely sensed meteorological data from satellites."

We examined the utility of including satellite-derived and other covariables (distance to coast, extraterrestrial solar radiation) for interpolating several climate variables across global land areas."

Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. We compiled monthly average climate data for weather stations from a large number of global, regional, national, and local sources, mostly for the 1970–2000 period. Utilizing satellite-derived data and other covariables, we interpolated these data using the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in ANUSPLIN and created global climate surfaces for monthly precipitation and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure. Final surfaces were created by selecting only the model with the lowest cross-validation RMSE value for each region, fit to the full dataset."

                "The digital data archive of nighttime lights was first established at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in 1992. Studies focusing on the application of nighttime lights have flourished since the publication of annual stable lights based upon DMSP-OLS by the NOAA Earth Observation Group (EOG). In the last few years, the EOG has processed and published nighttime lights from the VIIRS, which flown on the satellite launched in 2011. Some new features of VIIRS lights data include monthly updates, higher resolution, and better overall quality. Testing the applicability of new VIIRS lights in estimating economic statistics provides an important initial step. It is well known that economic development significantly influences and is highly correlated with inequality, poverty, public health, migration, urbanization, and a wide range of social phenomenon. The inquiry of the GDP-light association started when DMSP-OLS lights first became available. In the last decade, over a thousand publications have used DMSP-OLS lights to predict economic activities. These studies were important because, unlike conventional economic statistics provided by governments or international organizations, which are often inconsistent in timeframe, definition, and measurement instrument employed, nighttime lights have the advantage of being objectively measured, updated regularly, and cover the entire globe (except for at high latitudes). Additionally, lights data avoid systematic errors due to government misreporting or differences in methods, and this may make them a more reliable source in predicting true GDP values at the global, national, and local levels. The availability of DMSP-OLS annual stable lights from 1992 to 2013 allows researchers to investigate the GDP-lights relationship with cross-sectional and time series data during 1990s and 2010s. In general, the results suggest the DMSP-OLS lights are useful for cross-sectional analysis, but it may not provide enough information to predict time series economic statistics."

The GDP data by state and MSA are downloaded from the official website of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. For VIIRS lights, we use annual data for the corresponding time periods, i.e. annual average lights for 2014–2016. To generate consistent measure of annual VIIRS lights, we use averaged monthly composites as an annual light measure for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The digital values of VIIRS lights are aggregated at the state and metropolitan levels and then merged with real GDP by the administrative unit.

The results also indicate the importance of considering biases that may arise from different aggregations (the modifiable areal unit problems, MAUP) in applications of nighttime lights in understanding socioeconomic phenomenon."

                    "Answer": "Spatially interpolated gridded climate data, referred to as 'climate surfaces', are datasets used in various fields such as environmental, agricultural, and biological sciences. These datasets are generated by interpolating weather station data using methods like thin-plate splines, combined with covariates such as elevation and satellite-derived data, to create high-resolution climate estimates across global land areas.",

                    "Answer": "The VIIRS dataset offers higher resolution and quality, allowing for better prediction of economic statistics at finer scales, such as metropolitan areas, compared to the DMSP-OLS dataset. This suggests VIIRS lights are more closely related to urban economic activities, while DMSP-OLS may be less effective for time-series economic statistics.",

Nighttime lights data may be more effective in predicting urban economic activities compared to rural areas due to closer ties between lights and urban sectors.

However, it may not significantly enhance predictions if the climate station network is not dense and of high quality. The use of additional covariables like satellite data could refine interpolations, but the primary challenge remains the availability and quality of the station data.",
