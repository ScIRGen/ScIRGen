            "description": "The main idea of water resources estimation is to establish a machine learning model using runoff coefficient and runoff impact factors (climate, topography, land use, soil), and then convert the estimated runoff coefficient to runoff depth, and then converted to water resources volumn. Based on global public open accessed data, establish the runoff coefficient  topography, climate, soil, and land use, and the machine learning model for. Long-term annual runoff coefficient in the Belt and Road region was estimated and country level water resources was derived from precipitation of 2015 , The area of the country is estimated by the amount of water resources in the countries along the Belt and Road. A high-resolution runoff coefficient distribution map of the Belt and Road region was generated, which provided basic data support for water resources assessment and cross-border water distribution in the Belt and Road region.",

This could result in more precise calculations of the 2015 water runoff volumes and ultimately lead to better estimations of water resources available to each country along the 'Belt and Road' region. Enhanced model accuracy could also improve the reliability of high-resolution runoff coefficient distribution maps, offering stronger foundational data for water resource assessments and transboundary water allocation.",

The model is trained to estimate multi-year runoff coefficients for the 'Belt and Road' region. With precipitation data from 2015, the estimated runoff coefficients are converted to runoff depth, which is then used to calculate the water resources volume for each country based on its area. This results in a high-resolution distribution map of runoff coefficients that supports water resource assessment and transboundary water allocation in the region.",
