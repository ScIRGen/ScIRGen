Samples collected from songshan tin deposit, ore mineral is cassiterite, wall-rocks are biotite monzogranite and granodiorite. Single mineral were selected from the langfang Yuheng technology services company. Cathodoluminescence images and zircon U - Pb ages were finished at the SHRIMP Center at the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Science in Beijing. Monazite garnet, and cassiterite U - Pb ages and isotope dating were tested at the  Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using multiple receive inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA - icp-ms).  All the whole-rock analyses were performed at Activation Laboratories, ltd., Canada. the uncertainties were reported as 95 % confidence limit with high reliability. Data suggest that tin mineralization in the Songshan deposit occurred at the end of Late Cretaceous, which is quite different from the ages of the Pinghejie granitic pluton emplaced. Thus we can concluded that the tin mineralization in the Songshan deposit occurred at the end of Late Cretaceous. It is another important metallogenic period in the Changning tin area.",

The ore bodies mainly occur as tourmaline-quartz veins with NNE- and/or NW-trending in the Triassic Pinghejie granitic pluton, and the schist of the Proterozoic Songshan Formation. The previous study suggested the tin mineralization in the Songshan deposit should occur in the Triassic, but no directed age data support it. This hinders the understanding of the genesis of the Songshan tin deposit, especially the tin mineralization in the Lancangjiang tin belt. The zircon Hf isotopes (εHf(t) = – 22 ~ -12) and monazite Nd isotopes (εNd(t) = -13.04 ~ -11.80) indicate that the Pinghejie granitic pluton was derived from the remelting of Paleoproterozoic crust."

                    "Answer": "The instrumental techniques involve using a multi-receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) for U-Pb dating. Procedural steps include separating individual mineral grains like zircon, monazite, garnet, and cassiterite from their host rocks, preparing them as targets, capturing cathodoluminescence images, and then performing U-Pb dating at specialized centers equipped with the necessary instrumentation.",

                    "Answer": "Geochemical analysis of granitic rocks is conducted by collecting samples, typically of granodiorite and biotite monzogranite, and sending them to specialized geochemical laboratories, such as actlabs in Canada, for comprehensive analysis. Such labs provide data with high confidence levels (95% confidence), ensuring the reliability needed to understand mineral deposit genesis.",

                    "Answer": "Procedural challenges in geochronological analysis can arise from difficulties in accurately dating mineralization events due to complex geological histories. These challenges can be addressed by using a combination of different isotopic dating methods, such as U-Pb on zircon and other minerals, and integrating petrochemical analyses to provide a comprehensive timeline of geological events.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection might face challenges due to the complexity of distinguishing between mineralization events and the emplacement of granitic plutons. The expectation might be to find concurrent dates, but differences in ages, as seen in the Songshan deposit where tin mineralization occurred at the end of Late Cretaceous, can complicate interpretations and require precise petrochemical and geochronological analyses.",

                    "Answer": "The absence of directed age data could be due to previous assumptions that mineralization occurred simultaneously with granite formation, as suggested for the Songshan deposit. This hinders the understanding of the genesis, highlighting the expectation that dedicated U-Pb dating is needed to provide conclusive evidence of mineralization timing, which may not have been prioritized in earlier datasets.",

                    "Answer": "Isotopic data like Hf and Nd are expected to offer insights because they can trace the source material and geological processes involved. In the context of the Songshan deposit, these isotopes indicated the remelting of Paleoproterozoic crust, which guides researchers to expect isotopic analysis to help differentiate between crustal sources and processes contributing to both pluton formation and mineralization.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods, including U-Pb dating of zircon, monazite, garnet, and cassiterite grains, appear effective in constraining the timing of tin mineralization events. These methods provide precise age data that help distinguish between different geological periods and events, such as the Late Cretaceous tin mineralization and the emplacement of the Triassic granitic pluton. The high confidence level and reliability of the data suggest that these methods are well-suited for such studies.",

These approaches provide insights into the distinct geological events responsible for mineralization. To improve these approaches, integrating additional isotopic analyses, such as Hf and Nd isotopes, along with more extensive petrochemical analysis, could offer deeper insights into the source and evolution of the mineralizing fluids and the geological processes involved.",

These methods ensure high accuracy and reliability, with a confidence level of 95% in the dataset.",
