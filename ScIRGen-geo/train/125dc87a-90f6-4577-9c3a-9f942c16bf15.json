            "description": "The dataset of airborne microwave radiometers (L&K) mission was obtained in the Biandukou flight zone on Mar. 21, 2008.\n     The frequency of L bands was 1.4 GHz with back sight of 35 degree and dual polarization (H&V) was acquired; and the frequency of K band was 18.7 GHz at the nadir view angle without polarization. The plane took off at Zhangye airport at 8:00 (BJT) and landed at 11:40, from north to south along the scheduled lines at the altitude about 4100m (400m for the low flight) and speed about 290km/hr . \n     The raw data include microwave radiometer (L&K) data and GPS data; the former were instantaneous non-imaging observation recorded in text, which could be converted into brightness temperatures according to the calibration coefficients (filed with raw data together), and the latter were aircraft longitude,  latitude and attitude. Moreover, based on the respective real-time clock log, observations by the microwave radiometer and GPS can be integrated to offer coordinates matching for the former. Yaw, flip, and pitch motions of aircraft were ignored due to the low resolution of microwave radiometer observations. Observation information can also be rasterized, as required, after calibration and coordinates matching. L&K bands resolution (x) and footprint can be approximately estimated as x=0.3H (H is relative flight height) for L and x=0.24H for K.",

This process involves using predetermined coefficients to adjust the raw data, ensuring that the measurements accurately reflect the actual emitted microwave radiation levels. The calibration coefficients are archived alongside the original observation data to facilitate this conversion.",

The distinct polarizations help differentiate between various surface characteristics and environmental conditions, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the surveyed area.",

Additionally, the synchronization between the microwave radiometer and GPS clocks is crucial to ensure that the microwave observations can be accurately associated with geographic coordinate information recorded by the GPS.",

These observations, coupled with GPS data, aim to provide precise geographic coordinate information, enabling users to transform instantaneous digital values into brightness temperature values and create directly usable products. The process involves calibration, geographic coordination, and potentially rasterizing the data to match the resolution and footprint for the intended use.",

This process involves matching the time records of microwave observations with GPS data to assign geographical coordinates. Due to the coarse resolution of microwave radiometer observations, aircraft yaw, roll, and pitch effects are generally ignored in data processing. After calibration and coordinate matching, the observation information can be rasterized, considering the resolution consistent with the observation footprint, which is calculated as L-band, x=0.3H; K-band, x=0.24H, where H is the relative flight altitude.",
