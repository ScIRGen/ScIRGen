            "description": "Snow water equivalent (the product of snow depth and density) is an important factor reflecting the change in snow cover on the ground surface, and it is also an important parameter in surface hydrological models and climatic models. As the “Headwaters of Asia”, the Tibetan Plateau is the source of several major rivers, which are fed with glacier and snow meltwater. Based on the sensitivity of passive microwave radiation to snow, these monitoring data enable long-term inversion of snow water equivalents in the High Asia region. The data set includes daily snow water equivalent, monthly snow water equivalent and five-day snow water equivalent, and these data can be applied in analyses of local hydrology, animal husbandry production and other fields.",
