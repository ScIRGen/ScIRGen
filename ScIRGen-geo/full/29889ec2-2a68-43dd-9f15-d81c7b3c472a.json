The observation period is from 25 June to 17 Septemper, 2012 (UTC+8).\n\nMeasurement instruments:\nGermany Scintec MFAS Flat Array Sodar\n\nMeasurement position:\n60 meters northwest of Daman Super Station\n\nMeasurement period:\n25 June to 17 Septemper, 2012. \n24 hours of uninterrupted obeservation.\nAutomatically Recorded Data every half hour.\n\nData contents:\nWe obtain one data file every day. The data contents include observation height, wind speed, wind direction, wind speed in east – west direction, wind speed in south – north direction, vertical wind speed, standard deviation of vertical wind speed, backscatter intensity.\n\nRemarks:\nThe prectical obsevation height changes with the air water vapor content. Our obsevation point is located in the arid region. The air water vapor content is very low. Therefore the maximum obsevation height is about 300 meters.\nWhen it rains or very windy and dusty, the backscatter intensity is very high. Then the data would be miss or only has the vertical wind speed and backscatter intensity.",

This instrument collects data on wind direction, wind speed, and turbulence characteristics of the lower atmosphere at heights ranging from 30 to 300 meters, with a height interval of 10 meters and a temporal resolution of 30 minutes. It is especially useful in dry areas where the air's water vapor content is low, affecting measurement height limits.",

                    "Answer": "The variability in measurement height limits of wind profilers in arid regions is primarily influenced by the water vapor content in the air. In dry regions, like the one described, the water vapor content is low, which limits the measurement height to around 300 meters. This low water vapor content affects the data quality and availability, as it restricts the observable altitude range and may lead to data gaps, especially when weather conditions like rain or strong winds cause high backscatter intensity, resulting in missing data or data only on vertical velocity and backscatter intensity.",
