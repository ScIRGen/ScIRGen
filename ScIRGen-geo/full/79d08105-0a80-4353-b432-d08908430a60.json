The unit of Tmax and Tmin is K, and the unit of PPT is kgm-2s-1; the background filling value is -999. This dataset is a subset extraction fromthe original data. The original data was downloaded from https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/NEXGDDP/BCSD/ in August 2020; The NEX-GDDP data set is obtained from CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) historical climate and General Circulation Models (General Circulation Models) operating in RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) 4.5 scenario mode, including 21 atmospheric circulation models; among them, 2000 –2005 is a historical climate scenario, and 2006–2009 and 2090-2099 are RCP 4.5 scenarios.

These data are utilized in climate modeling by providing downscaled climate projections based on atmospheric circulation models. Specifically for the Tibetan Plateau, the data have been extracted from original datasets to focus on this region, covering historical climate scenarios from 2000 to 2005 and future projections under the RCP 4.5 scenario for 2006–2009 and 2090–2099.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing daily minimum and maximum temperature data, alongside precipitation data, from a dataset covering historical climate and future scenarios could enhance the accuracy and resolution of climate projections. This approach allows researchers to better understand trends and variations in local and regional climates over time, potentially leading to more robust predictions of future climate conditions. Additionally, it could improve the assessment of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human activities by providing detailed temporal data for analysis. The historical data helps to establish a baseline for understanding changes, while the future scenario data offers insights into possible future climate conditions based on different emission pathways.",
