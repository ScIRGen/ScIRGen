The wind speed/direction during September 23 to October 17 were wrong because the malfunction of datalogger. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2020-6-10 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "'气象要素梯度观测系统' refers to a meteorological element gradient observation system that involves the measurement of various atmospheric parameters such as wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, and pressure at different heights or depths. This system is used to monitor and analyze the vertical distribution and variation of these parameters in a specific area, providing comprehensive data for studying surface processes in the environment.",

                    "Answer": "The meteorological element gradient observation system uses sensors placed at various heights (3m to 40m) for wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, and relative humidity, ensuring a vertical profile of atmospheric conditions. In contrast, soil temperature and moisture monitoring employs sensors buried at multiple depths (from the surface to 160cm underground), focusing on the vertical soil profile. While both methods aim to capture gradient data, the meteorological system prioritizes atmospheric layers, whereas soil monitoring targets subsurface layers. Data accuracy is controlled by ensuring consistent data intervals and addressing issues like sensor malfunctions or data outliers.",

Other factors include the presence of data that exceed physical meaning or instrument range, which must be removed, and the need for consistent date and time formatting.

This approach can lead to improved understanding of microclimatic conditions in agricultural fields, enhance predictions of weather impacts on crop growth, and potentially optimize agricultural practices by providing precise environmental data. However, challenges such as data quality maintenance, handling missing data, and ensuring consistent calibration of sensors across different heights need to be managed.

This data can help in understanding the interactions between the atmosphere and the agricultural environment, which is critical for optimizing agricultural practices, improving crop yield, and managing resources efficiently.",
