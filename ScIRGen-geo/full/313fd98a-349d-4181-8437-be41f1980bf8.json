            "description": "1) Data content\nThe experimental data of indoor weir plug instability model were collected in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province and Chengdu, Sichuan Province. The experimental analysis is mainly completed in the State Key Laboratory of geological disaster prevention and geological environment protection. The instruments used include moisture content sensor, high-speed camera, test water tank, etc. The collection time is 2019-2021\n2) Data source: experimental analysis conducted by the State Key Laboratory of geological disaster prevention and geological environment protection\nProcessing method: according to the actual particle composition of the weir plug body, the test soil with different particle sizes is screened out by a sieve analyzer, then evenly mixed together according to the weight proportion, stacked according to the predetermined size, and the sensor is buried at the fixed position. Open the valve to a constant flow of 0.25 L / s, and at the same time, open the water content sensor and two high-speed cameras for observation until the dam body is damaged and the remaining dam body is stable. After the experiment, all the experimental data were sorted and analyzed\n3) The data are collected by correlation analysis instrument, which is true and reliable.\n4) It can provide data support for revealing the disaster mechanism of wide moderate narrow and steep gully type debris flow in strong earthquake area; The data of maximum scouring depth, impact force, abrasion force and scouring and silting volume can provide reference for the design of debris flow disaster prevention and control engineering",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method involves conducting indoor model experiments using instruments like moisture sensors, high-speed cameras, and experimental water tanks. The experiments simulate real particle composition of damming bodies by sieving test soils to different grain sizes, mixing them by weight proportion, and piling them to predetermined dimensions. Sensors are embedded at fixed locations while a constant water flow of 0.25 L/s is applied, with moisture sensors and cameras observing until the dam body fails and stabilizes.",

                    "Answer": "Sediment samples are processed by using a sieve analysis machine to separate soil into different grain sizes based on the actual particle composition of the dam body. These samples are then mixed uniformly by weight percentage and piled up to predetermined dimensions. Sensors are embedded at fixed positions within the sample. During the experiment, the valve is opened to a constant flow rate of 0.25 L/s, and moisture sensors along with two high-speed cameras are used for monitoring until the dam structure fails and stabilizes. Post-experiment, all collected data are systematically organized and analyzed.",
