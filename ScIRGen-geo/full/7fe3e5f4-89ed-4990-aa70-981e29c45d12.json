            "description": "This dataset contains the automatic weather station (AWS) measurements from site No.7 in the flux observation matrix from 28 May to 18 September, 2012. The site (100.36521° E, 38.87676° N) was located in a cropland (maize surface) in Yingke irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1556.39 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity (HMP45AC; 5 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), wind speed and direction (010C/020X; 10 m, towards north), a four-component radiometer (CNR4; 6 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, vertically downward), soil temperature profile (109; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), and soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates with one below the vegetation and the other between plants, 0.06 m). One of the infrared temperature sensors (IRT_2) was adjusted to a zenith angle of 50° after 6 August. \n The observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), air pressure (press, hpa), precipitation (rain, mm), wind speed (Ws_10 m, m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m, °), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation; W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IR_2, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, below the vegetation; Gs_2 and Gs_3, W/m^2), soil temperature profile (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_60 cm, and Ts_100 cm, ℃), and soil moisture profile (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_60 cm, and Ms_100 cm, %).\n            The data processing and quality control steps were as follows. (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min; therefore, there were 144 records per day. The missing data were filled with -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) In this dataset, the time of 0:10 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:10; the data were stored in *.xlsx format. (5) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
                "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
                "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method.

                    "Answer": "Multiscale observations, as demonstrated in the HiWATER experiment, are crucial for capturing eco-hydrological processes on heterogeneous surfaces. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of multi-scale interactions, although it is hindered by the poor availability of such observations. The nested instrumentation in HiWATER provides valuable data across different scales, which could be highly effective in addressing challenges in upscaling these processes.",

                    "Answer": "Combining stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes with eddy covariance measurements offers a robust method for validating evapotranspiration components, as it provides a more detailed understanding of evaporation and transpiration ratios. This method enhances model validation accuracy but may be limited by the complexity and availability of isotopic measurements. The approach shows promise in improving the estimation of evapotranspiration, especially when combined with high-resolution thermal imaging.",

                    "Answer": "Field observations from multiple sensors, such as thermal infrared cameras and eddy covariance systems, are integrated using models like the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model. This model uses component temperatures from soil and canopy to compute evaporation, transpiration, and evapotranspiration effectively. The methodology involves measuring and validating component temperatures with ground-based methods, like the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope technique, to ensure accurate estimations over heterogeneous landscapes.",

Validation against ground-based radiometric temperature measurements can also enhance accuracy.",
