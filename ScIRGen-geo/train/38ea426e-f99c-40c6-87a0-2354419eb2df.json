            "description": "This dataset includes lake surface water temperature and lake heat wave simulation results for 169 lakes in China. A one-dimensional lake model FLake coupled with satellite data (Coupling remote Sensing observations and FLake) was used to reconstruct and project lake surface water temperature. The hourly data in the historical period ranges from 1950-01-01 00:00:00 to 2022-12-31 23:00:00 and is driven by ERA5-Land during simulation. The daily future projection data ranges from 1950-01-01 to 2100-12-31, and is driven by NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 during simulation, with four shared socioeconomic paths (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). The simulated lake surface water temperature was validated by comparing it to satellite observations and in-situ observations from ten Chinese lakes (Lake Taihu, Lake Qiandao, Lake Poyang, Lake Hulun, Lake Namco, Lake Lugu, Lake Erhai, Lake Fuxian, Lake Chenghai, and Lake Dianchi). The average correlation coefficient with 171,479 satellite observations from 2000 to 2020 is 0.97, and the average root mean square error is 1.39 °C, indicating that the verification results are credible. This dataset can be used to further research into climate change and lake ecology.",

                "Global lakes store 87% of Earth’s liquid surface freshwater and provide numerous critically important ecosystem services to human society. However, lake ecosystems worldwide are already under severe threats from anthropogenic pressures and climate change. Lake surface water temperature (LSWT), an important physical indicator of the lake environment, is highly sensitive to climate change. Evidence is mounting that lake surface warming—especially an increasing occurrence of lake heatwaves—has significantly affected the physical and chemical environment of aquatic systems and, ultimately, biodiversity and human health. The common approaches used to characterize lake temperature change include ground observations, satellite data, and numerical simulations, but they yield results that are not often comparable. Ground observations of lake surface temperature are traditionally considered the most accurate but are scarcely and unevenly distributed both regionally and globally. Although satellite data could provide information on LSWT across large spatial scales and, indeed, help to fill the void in global lake observations, a temporally consistent estimate of lake surface temperature using satellite sensors is only possible during the cloud-free period. Furthermore, satellite observations of lake surface temperature could be influenced by the thermal characteristics of adjacent lands, especially for small lakes, thus contaminating the lake surface temperature signal. In contrast to satellite products and ground measurements, numerical lake models can provide a spatially-explicit estimate of high temporal resolution lake surface temperature at a longer time scale. However, the accuracy of the modeled lake surface temperatures is often questioned due to the simplified representation of physical processes in model structures, the uncertainties of atmospheric forcings, and poor parameterization of lake-specific parameters."

                "Here, we integrated satellite observations and a numerical model to improve lake temperature modeling and explore the multifaceted characteristics of trends in surface temperatures and lake heatwave occurrence in Chinese lakes from 1980 to 2100. Specifically, we proposed a framework that auto-calibrates model parameters for each lake simulated by the freshwater lake (FLake) model by assimilating satellite-derived LSWT from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESACCI; 2000–2020) project. Our results showed widespread warming and increased heatwaves in Chinese lakes during the past four decades."

                "The slow warming rate for Tibetan lakes can be explained by the dimming of solar radiation on the Tibetan Plateau, which is further related to the promoted deep convection by surface warming and moistening. However, this was not found in the pure modeling framework, highlighting that great uncertainties exist in both the lake model itself and the LSWT data used for model calibration. It should be noted that our sensitivity experiments can only detect the isolated effects of meteorological variables on lake temperature. As a result, there are still lakes that failed to compute FAR, indicating that non-linear interactions between multiple meteorological factors may play an important role."

We ran the FLake model from January 1st 1950 and repeated the first 365 days as the model spin-up. The model simulation results since 1980 were analyzed. Climate forcing from ERA5-Land was used to run FLake for the historical period. We performed six simulations, denoted as S1–S6, for the period 1979–2021 using climate fields from ERA5-Land. We first calibrated and validated the model parameters in FLake over the periods 2001–2010 and 2011–2020 using the workflow of CSFLake. We selected three important in-lake model parameters to improve model performances: light extinction coefficient, lake ice albedo, and depth factor."

Moreover, our analysis suggested that an asymmetric seasonal warming rate has led to a reduced temperature seasonality in eastern plain lakes but an amplified one in alpine lakes. The durations of lake heatwaves have also increased at a rate of 7.7 days per decade. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, lake surface temperature and lake heatwave duration were projected to increase by 2.2°C and 197 days at the end of the 21st century, respectively."
