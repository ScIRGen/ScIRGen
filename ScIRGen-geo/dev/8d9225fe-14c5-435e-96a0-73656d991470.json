            "description": "The dataset is the HWSD soil texture dataset of the Qinghai Lake Basin. The data comes from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) constructed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Vienna International Institute for Applied Systems (IIASA). Version 1.1 was released on March 26, The data resolution is 1km. The soil classification system used is mainly FAO-90.\nThe main fields of the soil attribute table include:\nSU_SYM90 (soil name in FAO90 soil classification system)\nSU_SYM85 (FAO85 classification)\nT_TEXTURE (top soil texture)\nDRAINAGE (19.5);\nROOTS: String (depth classification of obstacles to the bottom of the soil);\nSWR: String (soil moisture characteristics);\nADD_PROP: Real (a specific soil type related to agricultural use in the soil unit);\nT_GRAVEL: Real (gravel volume percentage); T_SAND: Real (sand content);\nT_SILT: Real (silt content);\nT_CLAY: Real (clay content);\nT_USDA_TEX: Real (USDA soil texture classification);\nT_REF_BULK: Real (soil bulk density);\nT_OC: Real (organic carbon content);\nT_PH_H2O: Real (pH)\nT_CEC_CLAY: Real (cation exchange capacity of cohesive layer soil);\nT_CEC_SOIL: Real (cation exchange capacity of soil)\nT_BS: Real (basic saturation);\nT_TEB: Real (exchangeable base);\nT_CACO3: Real (carbonate or lime content)\nT_CASO4: Real (sulfate content);\nT_ESP: Real (exchangeable sodium salt);\nT_ECE: Real (conductivity).\nThe attribute field beginning with T_ indicates the upper soil attribute (0-30cm), and the attribute field beginning with S_ indicates the lower soil attribute (30-100cm) (FAO 2009).\nThe data can provide model input parameters for modelers of the Earth system, and the agricultural perspective can be used to study eco-agricultural zoning, food security, and climate change.",

                    "Answer": "Factors contributing to challenges in accurately representing soil texture attributes in datasets sourced from global soil databases may include variations in soil classification systems, differences in data resolution, and regional discrepancies in soil characteristics. The HWSD, for instance, uses the FAO-90 soil classification system, which may not fully capture local variations in soil properties such as topsoil texture, gravel content, and organic carbon levels. Additionally, the 1km data resolution may lead to generalizations that overlook finer soil texture details.",

The detailed soil properties, such as texture, organic carbon content, and cation exchange capacity, offer essential parameters for earth system modeling and agricultural research, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and strategy development in these areas.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involved in collecting and categorizing soil texture data from a global soil database for regions such as the Qinghai Lake Basin include utilizing data from sources like the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), which integrates information from organizations such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). The process involves using the FAO-90 soil classification system to categorize soil types, and collecting specific soil attributes like topsoil texture, gravel content, sand, silt, clay percentages, and other chemical and physical properties at a 1km resolution. These attributes are then divided into topsoil (0-30cm) and subsoil (30-100cm) layers to support various applications, including earth system modeling and agricultural studies.",
