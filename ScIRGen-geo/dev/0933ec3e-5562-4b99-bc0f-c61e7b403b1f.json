            "description": "Based on the global surface water data (wod) from 1984 to 2018, the extreme precipitation frequency index and extreme precipitation intensity index were selected. Combined with the spatial analysis method in ArcGIS, the risk level of flood disaster in 34 key nodes under extreme precipitation conditions was constructed and evaluated. One belt, one road, 34 key nodes, is evaluated for the risk of flooding in the key areas of the \"one belt\" Road area under extreme precipitation events, which provides a basis for local government departments to make decisions and early warning before floods occur, so that we can gain valuable time for disaster prevention and mitigation measures to reduce the lives of the people brought by floods.
