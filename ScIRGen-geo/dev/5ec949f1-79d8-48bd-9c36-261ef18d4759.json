            "description": "Through the archaeological investigation and excavation of historical sites such as the site of Wuweicha Mountain Village, the site of Kaiyuan Temple in Zhengding and a large number of military sites in Xinjiang, the basic information of longitude and latitude, elevation, cultural attributes and cultural relics of the sites has been obtained. In addition, through scientific collection, identification and laboratory analysis of plant remains samples in the process of site investigation and excavation, a batch of site carbon 14th-century data, plant remains identification data, plant seed measurement and isotope data were obtained. At the same time, through the systematic carbon-14 dating of a large number of military-related sites (beacons and post stations) in Hami region of Xinjiang, combined with the results of the third cultural relics survey, the paper analyzed the spatio-temporal changes of human activities in this region during the historical period, and further combined with the historical documentation, archaeology and paleoclimate records. The influences of geopolitical change and climate change on human activities and regional social evolution are discussed.",
