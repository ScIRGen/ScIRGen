NOAA satellites are meteorological observation satellites. Provide meteorological environment information including temperature, precipitation, dew point, wind speed, etc. This dataset mainly covers key nodes in the Southeast Asia and Middle East regions. The main steps of data processing are as follows: firstly, the daily maximum temperature data is obtained by screening from a large number of basic meteorological data; the daily maximum temperature relative humidity relationship is integrated, and the daily relative humidity calculation is completed based on the dew point temperature data of the weather station. This data set provides basic information and a strong reference for evaluating the high temperature weather process in key node areas.",

                "The Sanjiangyuan region is located in the heart of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in the southern part of Qinghai Province. It is primarily characterized by mountainous terrain, with continuous mountain ranges and complex topography that slopes downward from west to east. The Sanjiangyuan region is rich in rivers, with numerous lakes and wetlands, and is widely covered by snow-capped mountains and glaciers. It is the source of three major rivers: the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Lancang River, continuously providing freshwater resources to the surrounding areas, earning it the title of \"China's Water Tower.\" The unique topography and climatic conditions of Sanjiangyuan have led to a diversity and uniqueness of vegetation types, including broadleaf forests, coniferous forests, meadows, grasslands, aquatic vegetation, cushion vegetation, and sparse vegetation. Both horizontal and vertical distributions are very distinct, with notable primitiveness and fragility. With global warming, the glaciers and snow-capped mountains in the Sanjiangyuan region are shrinking year by year; the areas of rivers, lakes, and wetlands are decreasing and drying up; desertification and soil erosion are expanding; and issues of desertification and grassland degradation are becoming increasingly prominent, leading to a significant deterioration of the ecological environment and a severe situation. Therefore, conducting research on the impact of climate change on the ecological environment in the Sanjiangyuan region is of great significance. Climate conditions are important factors determining vegetation growth and its spatial and temporal distribution. Vegetation indices are commonly used indicators that reflect the growth status of vegetation and changes in ecosystems, and they are sensitive to climate change. Based on vegetation indices, many scholars have conducted extensive scientific research on climate change and the ecological environment in the Sanjiangyuan region."

Based on different time scales, a statistical prediction model for NDVI at the pixel level in the Sanjiangyuan region will be established using multiple linear regression methods. Additionally, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and trends of NDVI in the Sanjiangyuan region from 2006 to 2050 will be predicted under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios."

By establishing statistical prediction models for NDVI in different seasons, the trend of NDVI changes in the Sanjiangyuan region under different emission scenarios over the next 40 years was predicted and analyzed."

The spatial distribution pattern of NDVI in the source area remains basically unchanged, and under the RCP8.5 scenario, the high-value center of NDVI has a larger range compared to the RCP4.5 scenario. In the RCP4.5 scenario, the rapid growth period of NDVI is from 2026 to 2035, with the high-value center located in the source area of the Lancang River; in the RCP8.5 scenario, there are two phases of rapid growth from 2016 to 2025 and from 2036 to 2045, with the high-value center both located in the source area of the Yangtze River. In both scenarios, the high-value centers of NDVI variation in the source area show a trend of moving from north to south."
