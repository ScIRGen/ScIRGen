                "Functional trait databases are emerging as a crucial tool for a wide range of ecological studies, including next-generation vegetation modelling across the world. However, few large-scale studies have been reported on plant traits in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the cradle of East Asian flora and fauna with specific alpine ecosystems, and no report on plant trait databases could be found. Plant traits of morphological, anatomical, physiological and phenological characteristics respond to changes in the living environment, affect ecosystem functions and drive species coexistence under environmental constraints. Over the past 3 decades, a growing body of trait analyses has quantified the global and regional distribution patterns of key functional traits, such as leaf, seed size, plant height, wood, plant form and function, root and flower. Such studies have successfully linked plant traits with environmental changes, natural and anthropogenic disturbances and ecosystem functions. Findings from plant trait–environment–ecosystem function interaction could be further utilised to map the spatial pattern of plant traits, build the next generation of vegetation models, predict vegetation distribution and function and be incorporated into the Earth system model. New insights into ecosystem traits and the trait network are bridging multiple dimensions of biology, macroecology and geoscience. All these works require global and regional plant trait databases, such as the TRY, Growth-Form, Global Inventory of Floras and Traits, Fine-Root, GRoot and tundra traits and the Plant Trait for Mediterranean Basin Species (BROT), China traits, AusTraits and LT-Brazil. However, the Earth still has undersampled regions. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) includes the two major regions of Qinghai Province and the Xizang Autonomous Region and partial areas from north-western Gansu Province, southern Xinjiang Autonomous Region, western Sichuan Province and north-western Yunnan Province in China and is also called the “Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau”. As the world’s “Third Pole”, the “Asia Water Tower” and the cradle of East Asian flora, the TP is the most underrepresented region in global and regional plant trait databases. The first version of the Chinese plant trait database does not contain data from the TP, and the global plant trait database TRY has only a few collections from various sources with non-systematic sampling. Field-based, local studies of plant functional traits on the TP have made some interesting advances. For example, Luo et al. (2005) linked the plant traits with ecosystem functions, He et al. (2006) explored the influencing factors on plant traits, Geng et al. (2014) quantified the patterns of plant trait correlations between above- and below-ground components, Wang et al. (2020) compared their work with the global dataset, and Xu et al. (2021) analysed the mechanism of plant trait variation along the altitude pattern. However, such works, where the sampling sites have been mostly along the main roads in the eastern TP, were also limited. Plant trait records from the central to western TP are extremely rare. However, the TP has the richest temperate alpine flora and the most abundant plant diversity in the world. It was also an evolutionary cradle for the herbaceous genera of China. The uplift of the TP and its unique alpine vegetation are important to the monsoon climate system and vegetation of East Asia and regional and global climate change studies. As the largest and highest plateau in the world, the TP has not only changed the regional and global climate system, geological structure, topography and hydrology, but has also influenced the evolution of the flora, fauna and biodiversity strongly. It has 8876 vascular species from 1371 genera and 211 families, including 6475 herbaceous and 2401 woody plants, of which 1706 were endemic to the TP, and has three biodiversity hotspots of the world. Vegetation changes from south-east to north-west, from lowland broad-leaved evergreen forests, including tropical rainforest and subtropical evergreen forest, montane mixed evergreen and deciduous forest, subalpine conifer forest to alpine shrubland, meadow, steppe and desert along an annual precipitation gradient from ca. 3000 to 50 mm. In physiognomy, the unique alpine vegetation looks similar to the arctic tundra but has different species composition. The plateau has amplified changes in climates, and rapid climate change has led to profound changes in alpine species and ecosystems. Plant traits, as the link amongst species, environment and ecosystem functions, are the best tools to study the impacts of climate change on vegetation."

            "research objective": [
                "In this work, a TP leaf trait dataset (TiP-Leaf) was established, and 11 leaf traits from 468 species of 1692 leaf samples were collected from 336 sites across five of the six vegetation types on the TP. The dataset could provide solid data support to effectively quantify the modern ecological features of alpine ecosystems, thereby further evaluating the response of alpine ecosystems to climate change and human disturbances and improving the next-generation vegetation model. This dataset is not only an update of the Chinese plant trait database, but is also a great contribution to the global trait database. Therefore, the establishment of the TP plant trait database and further analysis of plant trait–environment–ecosystem function relationships are of great significance to understanding the future change and sustainable development of the unique alpine vegetation on the roof of the world."
            ],
            "challenges": [
                "However, the dataset also presents some unavoidable limitations. For example, the establishment of sampling sites and the judgment of dominant and common species are mostly subjective. The leaves of some plants are extremely small, resulting in incomplete recognition when scanning the LA. Due to harsh field conditions, measuring the plant traits in time occasionally becomes impossible. Preventing some leaves from losing too much water to withering is still inevitable, although we have taken protective measures for the leaves. Inadequate collection of some leaf samples results in fewer data of plant chemical element content than that of morphological traits. In any case, performing large-scale collection of plant traits on the TP, which requires a lot of manpower and material resources as well as overcoming the adverse environment of high altitude and extreme variability, is not easy."
            ],
            "methods": [
                "The leaf traits of the dominant and common plant species of the TP distributed mostly across the plateau surface were sampled and measured from July to August in the summer of 2018–2021. Vegetation surveys were conducted in four regions, namely the source area of the Three Rivers in Qinghai Province in the north-eastern TP (2018), the southern Xizang Autonomous Region in the south-eastern and central TP (2019), Ngari Prefecture in the north-western TP and the Qaidam Basin of the north-eastern TP (2020), and the Qilian Mountains, the Altun Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains in the northern margin of the TP, passing through the southern margin of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Autonomous Region (2021). Considering the zonal vegetation types and the precipitation gradient, 336 sites were selected to investigate the vegetation with less grazing and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrubby and herbaceous vegetation was mainly selected (332 sites) along with the forest vegetation at the four sites (but removed for further analysis). At each site, one to three plots were set up to survey the species composition, abundance, coverage and plant height. The plot areas for herbaceous vegetation, shrubby vegetation and forest vegetation were 1 m ×1 m, 2 m×2 m or 5 m ×5 m and 10 m×10 m, respectively. Geographical locations, natural and human disturbances, and vegetation types were also recorded. The dominant and common plant species at each site were determined by visual inspection, the leaf samples of these plants were picked up, and the leaf traits were measured. At each site, two to three mature and disease-free complete leaves from each individual of dominant and common plant species were collected, and at least 30 individuals were selected to meet the needs of trait measurement and element analysis. When the single leaf was small, microphyllous or leptophyllous, 100–200 leaves were picked. In total, 11 leaf functional traits (e.g. leaf thickness, LT; fresh weight, FW; dry weight, DW; leaf dry-matter content, LDMC; leaf water content, LWC; leaf area, LA; specific leaf area, SLA; leaf mass per area, LMA; leaf carbon content, LCC; leaf nitrogen content, LNC; leaf phosphorus content, LPC) were measured and calculated on the basis of the handbook of standardised measurement for plant functional traits worldwide. LT (mm) was measured on the sampling day by using Vernier callipers with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. The thickness in the middle of the vein and margin of each leaf was measured, and then the average of the five leaves was taken as the LT of a species. In addition to LT, 20–30 leaves for normal-leaved plants and 100–200 leaves for small- to leptophyll-leaved plants were generally selected for other trait variable measurements. FW (g) was obtained by weighing with a 1 /100 electronic balance. Subsequently, the fresh leaves were oven dried at 75 ◦C for 48–72 h to obtain the DW (g). LDMC was measured as follows: LDMC (g g−1) =DW/FW. LA (cm 2) was measured using a scanner (EPSON Perfection V 700 Photo Scanner) and software (WinFOLIA Pro, Canada). SLA and LMA were measured as follows: SLA (cm2 g−1) =LA/DW and LMA (g m −2) =DW/LA ×104. The dried leaves were further used for chemical analysis. LCC (mg g−1), LNC (mg g−1) and LPC (mg g−1) were determined by the outside-temperature hot potassium dichromate oxidation–volumetric method, the distillation–titration method and the vanadium molybdate yellow colorimetric method, respectively."

                "In this work, an extensive dataset of 11 leaf functional traits (TiP-Leaf), mainly for herbs and shrubs and a few trees on the TP, was compiled through field surveys. The TiP-Leaf dataset, which was compiled from 336 sites distributed mainly on the plateau surface and the northern margin of the TP across alpine and temperate vegetation regions and sampled from 2018 to 2021, contained 1692 morphological trait measurements of leaf thickness, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, leaf dry-matter content, leaf water content, leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf mass per area and 1645 chemical element trait measurements of leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Thus, 468 species that belong to 184 genera and 51 families were obtained and measured. In addition to leaf trait measurements, the geographic coordinates, bioclimate variables, disturbance intensities and vegetation types of each site were also recorded. The dataset, which is available from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC; Jin et al., 2022a; https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.272516), can make a great contribution to the regional and global plant trait databases."

                "功能性特征数据库正在成为广泛生态研究的重要工具，包括全球下一代植被建模。然而，关于青藏高原（TP）植物特征的大规模研究报道较少，且未找到关于植物特征数据库的相关报告。植物的形态、解剖、生理和物候特征等特征对生存环境的变化作出响应，影响生态系统功能，并在环境约束下驱动物种共存。在过去的30年中，越来越多的特征分析量化了关键功能特征的全球和区域分布模式，如叶片、种子大小、植物高度、木材、植物形态与功能、根系和花朵。这些研究成功地将植物特征与环境变化、自然和人为干扰及生态系统功能联系起来。植物特征—环境—生态系统功能相互作用的研究结果可以进一步用于绘制植物特征的空间模式，构建下一代植被模型，预测植被分布和功能，并纳入地球系统模型。对生态系统特征和特征网络的新见解正在桥接生物学、宏观生态学和地球科学的多个维度。所有这些工作都需要全球和区域植物特征数据库，如TRY、Growth-Form、全球植物和特征清单、Fine-Root、GRoot、苔原特征、地中海盆地植物特征（BROT）、中国特征、AusTraits和LT-Brazil。然而，地球上仍有许多未被充分采样的区域。青藏高原包括青海省和西藏自治区的两个主要区域，以及中国西北甘肃省、南疆自治区、西四川省和西北云南省的部分地区，也被称为“青藏高原”。作为世界的“第三极”、“亚洲水塔”和东亚植物的发源地，青藏高原是全球和区域植物特征数据库中最缺乏代表性的区域。中国植物特征数据库的第一个版本不包含来自青藏高原的数据，而全球植物特征数据库TRY仅有少量来自不同来源的非系统性采样的记录。关于青藏高原植物功能特征的基于实地的地方研究取得了一些有趣的进展。例如，Luo等（2005）将植物特征与生态系统功能联系起来，He等（2006）探讨了植物特征的影响因素，Geng等（2014）量化了地上和地下成分之间植物特征相关性的模式，Wang等（2020）将他们的工作与全球数据集进行了比较，Xu等（2021）分析了植物特征沿海拔变化的机制。然而，这些工作主要集中在东青藏高原的主要道路沿线，样本点也相对有限。中部和西部青藏高原的植物特征记录极为稀少。然而，青藏高原拥有世界上最丰富的温带高山植物群和最丰富的植物多样性。它也是中国草本属的进化摇篮。青藏高原的抬升及其独特的高山植被对季风气候系统以及东亚的植被和区域及全球气候变化研究具有重要意义。作为世界上最大和最高的高原，青藏高原不仅改变了区域和全球气候系统、地质结构、地形和水文，还强烈影响了植物、动物和生物多样性的进化。它拥有8876种维管植物，来自1371个属和211个科，其中6475种为草本植物，2401种为木本植物，1706种为青藏高原特有种，并拥有三个全球生物多样性热点。植被从东南向西北变化，从低地阔叶常绿森林，包括热带雨林和亚热带常绿森林，山地混交常绿和落叶森林，亚高山针叶林到高山灌丛、草甸、草原和沙漠，沿着年降水量梯度从约3000毫米到50毫米。在植物形态上，独特的高山植被看起来与北极苔原相似，但物种组成不同。高原气候变化加剧，快速的气候变化导致高山物种和生态系统发生深刻变化。植物特征作为物种、环境和生态系统功能之间的联系，是研究气候变化对植被影响的最佳工具。"
