            "description": "This data provides the annual lake area of ​​582 lakes with an area greater than 1 km2 in the enorheic basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 1986 to 2019.\n\nFirst, based on JRC and SRTM DEM data, 582 lakes are identified in the area that are larger than 1 km2. All Landsat 5/7/8 remote sensing images covering a lake are used to make annual composite images. NDWI index and Ostu algorithm were used to dynamically segment lakes, and the size of each lake from 1986 to 2019 is then calculated.\n\nThis study is based on the Landsat satellite remote sensing images, and using Google Earth Engine allowed us to process all Landsat images available to create the most complete annual lake area data set of more than 1 km2 in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area; A set of lake area automatic extraction algorithms were developed to calculate of the area of ​​a lake for many years; This data is of great significance for the analysis of lake area dynamics and water balance in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, as well as the study of the climate change of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau lake.",
