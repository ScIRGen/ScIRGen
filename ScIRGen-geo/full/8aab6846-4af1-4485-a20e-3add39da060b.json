            "description": "The data set includes soil organic carbon concentrations data of representative soil samples collected from July 2012 to August 2013 in the Heihe River Basin. The first soil survey was conducted in 2012. After the representativeness evaluation of collected samples, we conducted an additional sampling in 2013. These samples are representative enough to represent the soil variation in the Heihe River Basin, of which the soil variation in each landscape could be accounted for. The sampling depths in field refer to the sampling specification of Chinese Soil Taxonomy, in which soil samples were taken from genetic soil horizons.",

This approach aimed to reflect the overall spatial distribution patterns of soil properties across the basin. The depth of field soil sample collection was guided by the Chinese soil system classification, focusing on diagnostic horizons and characteristics, which played a crucial role in the soil sampling strategy.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection involved representative sampling methods that covered the upstream, midstream, and downstream areas of the Heihe River Basin, encompassing its typical landscape types. The process included an initial field soil survey and sampling in 2012, followed by a quantitative evaluation of existing soil profile sampling points in 2013. This evaluation highlighted landscapes with poorly representative profile points, leading to a supplemental survey plan and a second soil survey and sampling.",
