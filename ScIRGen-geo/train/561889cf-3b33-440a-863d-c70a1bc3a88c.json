            "description": "The data set is the HWSD soil texture dataset of the Shulehe River Basin. The data comes from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) constructed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Vienna International Institute for Applied Systems (IIASA). Version 1.1 was released on March 26, 2009. The data resolution is 1km. The soil classification system used is mainly FAO-90.\nThe main fields of the soil attribute table include:\nSU_SYM90 (soil name in FAO90 soil classification system)\nSU_SYM85 (FAO85 classification)\nT_TEXTURE (top soil texture)\nDRAINAGE (19.5);\nROOTS: String (depth classification of obstacles to the bottom of the soil);\nSWR: String (soil moisture characteristics);\nADD_PROP: Real (a specific soil type related to agricultural use in the soil unit);\nT_GRAVEL: Real (gravel volume percentage); T_SAND: Real (sand content);\nT_SILT: Real (silt content);\nT_CLAY: Real (clay content);\nT_USDA_TEX: Real (USDA soil texture classification);\nT_REF_BULK: Real (soil bulk density);\nT_OC: Real (organic carbon content);\nT_PH_H2O: Real (pH)\nT_CEC_CLAY: Real (cation exchange capacity of cohesive layer soil);\nT_CEC_SOIL: Real (cation exchange capacity of soil)\nT_BS: Real (basic saturation);\nT_TEB: Real (exchangeable base);\nT_CACO3: Real (carbonate or lime content)\nT_CASO4: Real (sulfate content);\nT_ESP: Real (exchangeable sodium salt);\nT_ECE: Real (conductivity).\nThe attribute field beginning with T_ indicates the upper soil attribute (0-30cm), and the attribute field beginning with S_ indicates the lower soil attribute (30-100cm) (FAO 2009).\nThe data can provide model input parameters for modelers of the Earth system, and the agricultural perspective can be used to study eco-agricultural zoning, food security, and climate change.",

                    "Answer": "An example of a data collection method for determining soil texture in a large river basin involves using satellite imagery and ground-truthing techniques to gather data at a resolution of 1km. This method would likely involve collaboration with international organizations such as the FAO and IIASA, which compile global soil databases like the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD). The data collection would categorize soil properties using systems such as FAO-90 and include various soil attributes like texture, organic carbon content, and cation exchange capacity, providing essential parameters for earth system modeling and agricultural research.",

                    "Answer": "The Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) uses a resolution of 1km and primarily employs the FAO-90 soil classification system. In comparison, other global soil databases might utilize different resolutions and classification systems, which could affect the granularity and classification accuracy of soil data. The HWSD's comprehensive attributes, such as soil texture, organic carbon content, and cation exchange capacities, provide detailed insights that may differ in scope and detail from other databases.",

                    "Answer": "Expanding data collection methods to include additional soil attributes could enhance the precision and reliability of agricultural research and ecological modeling. It could allow for more comprehensive analyses of soil characteristics, leading to improved model input parameters. This would aid in understanding soil's impact on ecological agriculture zoning, food security, and climate change, potentially leading to more sustainable land use practices and better prediction models.",
