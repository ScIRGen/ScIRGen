            "description": "This dataset consists of glacier-level (30 m) and gridded (0.1°/0.5°) mass change in the source rivers in the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETPR) from 1970s to 2000. The glacier-level data contains elevation difference in recent 30 years, annual mass balance, and mass change uncertainty for 17444 glaciers. We applied digital elevation models derived from large scale topographic maps based on aerial photogrammetry during 1970s compared with SRTM (2000) to give complete picture of mass change of glaciers in the region based on co-registration, bias correction and quality control. The results derived from ICESat-2 and KH-9 were used to evaluate the Topo based elevation difference. Our results show similar quality with KH-9 based results in low altitude. However, the uncertainty is high in high altitude due to the saturation of aerial photos over high reflectance snow surface on a steep terrain. This dataset covers almost 80% glaciers in the ETPR, which makes it an advantage to apply for parameters calibration in mass balance simulation at all levels. In addition, the dataset can be involved in the evaluation for the difference of glacier hydrological effect before and after 2000.",
            "instructions": "File name: The data is stored in NetCDF format. The name of the glacier-level mass change file is \"xxx. nc\", where xxx represents the GLIMS code. For example, \"G078752E3118.nc\" represents the mass change of the glacier numbered G078752E3118 from 1970 to 2000. The name of the grided mass change file is \"dh_swr_ideg_1970s-2000_vj. nc\", where i represents the resolution and j represents the version number.\nData reading method: The files in this dataset can be opened directly with QGIS. If you want to further view the details or perform secondary processing, you can use xarray (Python) to operate.",
