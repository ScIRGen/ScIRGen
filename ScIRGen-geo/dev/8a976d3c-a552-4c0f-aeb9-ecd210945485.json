            "description": "The dataset contains the phenological camera observation data of the Daman Superstation in the midstream of Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31, 2021. The instrument was developed and data processed by Beijing Normal University. The phenomenon camera integrates data acquisition and data transmission functions. The camera captures data by look-downward with a resolution of 1280×720. For the calculation of the greenness index and phenology, the relative greenness index (GCC, Green Chromatic Coordinate, calculated by GCC=G/(R+G+B)) needs to be calculated according to the region of interest, then the invalid value filling and filtering smoothing are performed, and finally the key phenological parameters are determined according to the growth curve fitting, such as the growth season start date, Peak, growth season end, etc. For coverage, first, select images with less intense illumination, then divide the image into vegetation and soil, calculate the proportion of vegetation pixels in each image in the calculation area. After the time series data is extracted, the original coverage data is smoothed and filtered according to the time window specified by the user, and the filtered result is the final time series coverage. This data set includes relative greenness index (Gcc).\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for sites information in the Citation section.",

                "Arid and semiarid regions represent approximately 30 % of the global terrestrial surface area (Dregne, 1991; Scanlon et al., 2006), and dryland expansion occurs under climate change, especially in developing countries (Huang et al., 2016). An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

Understanding the basic characteristics of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert ecosystems is important to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the oasis–desert area and support the ecological security and sustainable development of the oasis. A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."

Half-hourly turbulent flux data were acquired by an eddy covariance system and scintillometer.

This index helps in determining phenological phases by analyzing changes in greenness over time.",
