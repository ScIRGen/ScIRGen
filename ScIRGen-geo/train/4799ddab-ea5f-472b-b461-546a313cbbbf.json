            "description": "This data product is based on various statistical data and field investigation data, and conducts quantitative analysis and evaluation of the entire region, province, and county. Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process and expert scoring method, weights are assigned to indicators at all levels to further obtain spatiotemporal changes in the intensity of human engineering activities on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, revealing the spatiotemporal differences in the intensity of human engineering activities on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, and scientifically evaluating their intensity changes. The content includes data on the intensity of energy engineering construction, municipal infrastructure construction, transportation infrastructure construction, and human engineering activities on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, with county-level units. The construction intensity of energy engineering mainly selects three secondary indicators, namely wind power construction intensity, photovoltaic construction intensity, and hydropower construction intensity, as well as 12 tertiary indicators; The intensity of municipal infrastructure construction mainly selects five secondary indicators: communication penetration, medical coverage, education coverage, pension insurance coverage, and built-up area scale index; The intensity of transportation infrastructure construction mainly selects two secondary indicators, namely road network density and transportation hub radiation, and seven tertiary indicators; Quantitative analysis and evaluation of the intensity of human engineering activities on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau are conducted at different scales across the entire region, province, and county, revealing the spatiotemporal differences in the intensity of human engineering activities on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The sources of energy development data and municipal infrastructure construction intensity data are various statistical data and field survey data. Using a five-year interval as the time node (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020); The source data of transportation infrastructure construction intensity is OpenStreetMap transportation network data. Obtain point data of passenger stations through network resources, mainly including geographical location data of passenger stations in counties on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Data products help evaluate the goals of adaptive development and balancing ecological environment and economic development in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau region.",

This approach uses a five-year interval for time points (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020). In contrast, OpenStreetMap is used primarily for transportation infrastructure data, offering detailed, up-to-date network data and point data for passenger station locations, potentially providing finer spatial resolution but possibly lacking the systematic time interval structure of the other methods.",
