            "description": "In order to analyze how and when it entered the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and explore the relationship between its spread and domestication in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and the plateau settlement of early human activities and the ancient Silk Exchange, in June 2018, the research team used three generations of genome sequencing technology to sequence the whole genome and de novo assembly of F1 generation of its self bred varieties in Nangqian County, Qinghai Province, and got a genome size of 40 9.69 MB, contig N50 is 1.21 MB. This result can provide genetic basis for studying the relationship between plant diffusion and human activities. At the same time, this study is helpful to reveal the influence of artificial domestication and human selection on the genetic differentiation of cyanine, and the adaptive mechanism of cyanine to adapt to the plateau ecological environment.",
