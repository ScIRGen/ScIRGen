            "description": "This dataset obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Huailai station from January 1 to December 31, 2020. The site (115.7923° E, 40.3574° N) was located on a cropland (maize surface) which is near Donghuayuan town of Huailai city, Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), air pressure (in the box), rain gauge (3 m, south of tower), four-component radiometer (4 m, south of tower), two infrared temperature sensors (4 m, south of tower, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (4 m, south of tower, vertically upward), soil heat flux -0.06 m), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (-0.02, -0.04 m), soil temperature profile (-0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), soil moisture profile (-0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_3 m, Ta_5 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m, Ta_20 m, Ta_30 m, and Ta_40 m; RH_3 m, RH_5 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m, RH_20 m, RH_30 m, and RH_40 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_3 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m, Ws_20 m, Ws_30 m, and Ws_40 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (μmol/ (s m-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2020-6-10 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "Using high-frequency data collection methods, such as a 30-second sampling interval, can enhance the accuracy and reliability of meteorological datasets by capturing rapid changes and transient events that may occur in agricultural regions. This approach allows for detailed temporal resolution, helping to understand diurnal patterns and short-term variations in weather conditions, which are crucial for agricultural applications. However, it also poses challenges such as increased data volume, the need for robust data storage and processing capabilities, and potentially higher costs for data management. Proper quality control and validation processes are essential to ensure the reliability of the collected data.",
