            "description": "The molecular phylogeny of gammarids was reconstructed based on collections from the Tibetan Plateau. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh specimens and molecular sequences were acquired by PCR. The phylogeny was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods. Reduced-Representation Genome Sequencing was conducted for 10 individuals per population to explore the population dynamics. Based on the phylogeny of gammarids from the Tibetan Plateau, the effects of climate change will be addressed and the adaptation of gammarids will be discussed. This dataset can be used to evaluate the species diversity and to give a background for biodiversity conservation.",
