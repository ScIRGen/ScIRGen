            "description": "The circumpolar boreal and tundra biomes are the highest concentrations of the global inland water bodies, including lakes, reservoirs, and ephemeral ponds. The majority of these water bodies are small-sized but enormous in number. These small water bodies are essential to global greenhouse gas emissions; however, they are vulnerable to climate change, and little has been known. Thus, it is critical to investigate water bodies in this highly concentrated region, especially the small water bodies. This study presented a comprehensive dataset of water bodies for the tundra and boreal biomes in North America (WBD-NAHL). The 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 and the 30-m resolution JRC water dataset were adopted as the main inputs to enhance the ability on identifying small water bodies (Figure 1). The main contributions of this dataset are as follows: 1) the first investigation of water bodies in the tundra and boreal biomes in North America. Nearly 6.5 million water bodies were identified, about 90% of which were smaller than 0.1 km2; 2) this dataset provides the locations, areas, and morphological attributes for each water body, enabling the analysis of water body distribution, types, and more, which is expected to support studies in the water cycle, carbon emission, and permafrost in high latitudes under global climate change.\nFigure 1: Distributions of the percent (a), area (b), perimeter (c), and SI (d), and the number (e) of the water bodies in the North American tundra and boreal forest regions (aggregated to 5 km×5 km grids).\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 42171140) and the NSFC BSCTPES project (grant no. 41988101)\n",

                "Inland surface waters are abundant in the tundra and boreal forests of North America, essential to environments and human societies but vulnerable to climate changes. These high-latitude water bodies differ greatly in their morphological and topological characteristics related to the formation, type, and vulnerability. Inland surface water occupies only 2 % of the global land surface, but it plays a critical role in terrestrial ecosystems. More than 55 % of global surface waters are located in high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, and these northern high-latitude waters are generally small and densely clustered. The high latitudes have warmed faster than other regions, with annual surface temperatures increasing > 1.4 ◦C over the past century. This change in climate is driving changes in terrestrial ecosystems in the Arctic as well. For example, increases in vegetation productivity have been observed across the northern high latitudes. Meanwhile, high-latitude water bodies have started changing since the early 1970s. Permafrost thawing poses a threat to the stability of inland surface waters, especially in arctic lowland surface areas, where most of the water bodies could be thermokarst lakes and have strong interactions with permafrost in the regions. The morphology of the water bodies could be shaped by the surrounding environment. Shoreline complexity affects lake ice formation. Lake connectivity affects fish migration, fish habitats, aquatic assemblages, and water self-purification and accelerates water cycling. The density of water bodies impacts fish density and biomass. The shape and distribution of water bodies reflect what led to the water body formation. Furthermore, information about lake area extent can improve Arctic land surface modeling. In the past, inland surface water was mapped at sub-hectare (i.e., 30 m) resolution using satellite data, and these data provided unprecedented information about the global extent of inland waters, including their spatial distribution and temporal changes. Existing datasets containing information that describe water body shapes, such as the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) and HydroLAKES, are limited to water bodies larger than 0.1 km²."

Limit errors in the satellite data provide substantial sources of uncertainty, including an inability to separate rivers and streams because the resolution is too coarse, bias in estimates of water extent resulting from temporal gaps in the data, and misclassifications resulting from spectral resolution. The misclassifications impacted by terrain (e.g., mountain shadows) still exist, even though they have been substantially reduced during data processing."

The approach was applied to the Sentinel-2 data acquired in 2019 to produce the water body dataset for the entire tundra and boreal forests in North America. A machine learning model was trained to retrieve water extent from the Sentinel-2 images from possible water extent restricted by the water probability layer. Permanent water pixels were identified from the resulting water frequency layer as being those pixels with at least 50 % occurrence between June and September. The resulting water pixels were then converted to vector polygons using the “Raster to Polygon” tool in ESRI ArcMap 10.2."

                    "Answer": "Mapping inland surface waters at a fine resolution allows for a more detailed understanding of climate change impacts by identifying small, densely clustered water bodies that are vulnerable to changes like permafrost thawing. This can provide insights into terrestrial ecosystem changes, such as vegetation productivity and alterations in water body morphology, which are crucial for modeling and predicting future climatic effects.",

                    "Answer": "Developing a dataset that can delineate inland surface waters as small as 0.001 km² is important because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive inventory of water bodies, which are critical to terrestrial ecosystems. These small and densely clustered northern high-latitude waters play a significant role in hydrology, matter, and energy cycles, and their detailed mapping can improve Arctic land surface modeling.",

                    "Answer": "An automated approach was developed to detect surface water extent and identify water bodies using 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite data. The machine learning model was trained to retrieve water extent from the images, and permanent water pixels were identified from the water frequency layer with at least 50% occurrence between June and September.

The water index extracted the loose water extent, while random forest methods extracted a more accurate water extent. This approach helped achieve an overall accuracy of 98% in the dataset for high-latitude regions.",
