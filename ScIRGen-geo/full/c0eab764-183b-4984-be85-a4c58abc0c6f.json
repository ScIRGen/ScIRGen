            "description": "\tThe dataset is the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) products of 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is produced based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the SAVI equation which is added soil adjusted parameters S based on NDVI equation.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.SAVI is stable in the sparse vegetation area, but is not sensitive in the dense vegetation area .The spatial resolution is 30m， and temporal resolution is 16-day theoretically, while depends on the actual Landsat surface reflectance dataset.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the SAVI result of each image is stored in a folder including the SAVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SAVI;the SAVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become 16-bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be multiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.\n",

                    "Question": "How might the incorporation of a soil adjustment factor in calculating the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) influence the interpretation of vegetation health in sparse versus densely vegetated regions on the Tibetan Plateau?",
                    "Answer": "The incorporation of a soil adjustment factor in calculating the SAVI is designed to stabilize the index in regions where vegetation is sparse, making it less sensitive to soil brightness variations. This adjustment helps prevent overestimation of vegetative cover in areas with minimal vegetation. However, in densely vegetated regions, the SAVI becomes less sensitive, as the vegetation itself dominates the reflection characteristics, reducing the impact of the soil adjustment factor. Thus, the SAVI is more reliable for interpreting vegetation health in sparse areas, while in densely vegetated regions, its utility may be limited, necessitating alternative indices or methods for accurate assessment.",

                    "Answer": "The stability of the SAVI in sparsely vegetated areas is primarily due to the introduction of a soil adjustment factor in its calculation, which helps account for the influence of soil brightness. This adjustment makes the index more reliable in areas where vegetation cover is sparse. In contrast, in densely vegetated areas, the soil adjustment factor has less impact, leading to reduced sensitivity of the SAVI.",

The dataset is based on Landsat series satellite surface reflectance data and aims to improve vegetation analysis by incorporating soil adjustment factors.",

This method helps to produce the SAVI data specifically for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.",

                    "Answer": "The SAVI method is expected to be stable in sparse vegetation areas, but it is not sensitive in densely vegetated regions. This is due to the fact that the soil-adjustment factor in SAVI helps in areas with less vegetation but does not provide additional sensitivity in areas where vegetation is already dense.",
