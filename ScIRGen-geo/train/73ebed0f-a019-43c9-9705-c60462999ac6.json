            "description": "This data includes the surface water temperature of 2260 lakes in China and the surface water temperature of lakes after removing heat extremes. The data was simulated using a physical/statistical hybrid model Air2Water coupled with satellite data. The time resolution of the data is daily, with a time range of 1985-01-01 to 2022-12-31, and the meteorological driven data is ERA5-Land. The reference data  is LST product from Landsat. This data is verified with the in-situ observation data of six lakes in China (Lake Taihu, Lake Qiandaohu, Lake Hulunhu, Lake Namco, Lake Luguhu and Lake Erhai). The correlation coefficient is higher than 0.96, the average root mean square error is 1.75 ℃, and the average absolute error is 1.38 ℃. The verification results are credible. This data can provide a basis for research on climate change and lake ecology.",

There is overwhelming evidence that heat extremes (e.g., heatwaves), one of the perilous consequences of climate change, are exhibiting an alarming increase in frequency and intensity worldwide. Lakes, as crucial and vulnerable components of the Earth’s ecosystem, bear significant impacts during heat extremes. In China, lakes larger than 1 km² cover a substantial area of approximately 93,723 km² and play an irreplaceable role in flood and drought prevention, water purification, and biodiversity conservation. However, despite their ecological and socio-economic significances, the response of these lakes to climate change, particularly in relation to heat extremes, has received comparatively little attention."

                    "Answer": "Challenges in accurately simulating lake surface water temperature (LSWT) may arise due to variations in lake sizes, elevations, latitudes, and depths, which can affect the performance of models. Additionally, the presence of heat extremes and the need to integrate diverse data sources like satellite and in situ observations can further complicate the simulation process.",

                    "Answer": "The use of satellite data coupled with physical/statistical models seems to be highly effective for simulating lake surface water temperature, as evidenced by the high correlation coefficients (>0.96) and low errors (average RMSE of 1.75°C and average absolute error of 1.38°C) when validated against in situ observations from six lakes.",

                    "Answer": "Heat extremes significantly influence long-term lake surface temperature datasets by contributing 36.5% to the warming trends. Mitigating these influences could involve removing extreme values to better estimate general temperature trends, as indicated by the reduced warming rate after excluding heat extremes.",
