            "description": "This dataset is the precipitation observation data obtained by Yong Bin's team from Hohai University through the deployment of rainfall collection instruments at the hydrological station of Chuzhou in the Huaihe River Basin. Raw data were collected from the HOBO RG3-M rain gauge from January 2019 through December 2022. Firstly, the research group excluded outliers by visual interpretation, then used MATLAB software to perform extreme value test and time domain test on the data, and finally accumulated the data to 1 hour to form hourly precipitation observation dataset. The collection of this dataset provides a reference for the high-precision verification of ground grids of satellite precipitation products, which can improve the accuracy of satellite precipitation products to a larger extent. It is of great significance for the future use of quasi real-time satellite precipitation products for natural disaster event warning.",

                "As one of the most important water cycle elements, precipitation is the release of water from the atmosphere to reach the surface of the earth. Measurement of precipitation has a long history, but till now precisely measuring precipitation is still a challenging task due to the high spatio-temporal variability and inhomogeneity of precipitation itself. Rain gauges can provide point observations of precipitation and are normally recognized as \"ground truth\" for validating the radar-estimated or satellite-retrieved rainfall. However, in practice, some systematic and random errors, such as the diversity of rain gauge designs, wind-induced gauge undercatch, human operating errors, and the instability of gauge installations, inevitably affect the accuracy of gauge-measured precipitation. Among them, the most popular rain gauge is TBR owing to its simple, durable, highly reliable, and inexpensive design. As a special model of TBRs, the HOBO Data Logging Rain Gauge RG3-M (RG3-M) is a battery-powered rainfall data collection and recording system, which includes one small lithium battery (3 volt, CR-2032) embedded in its data logger enveloped by waterproof material inside the gauge cylinder. Because of this advantage, RG3-M gauges are particularly well suited to be installed in remote regions for various research studies of meteorology, hydrology, ecology, and agriculture."

Altogether 10 models of rain gauges installed in the Chuzhou hydrological station, China, were employed to record the rainfall events and raining processes. Here, we collected the observed rainfall data of 18 rainfall events occurred in 2017 to quantify the measurement accuracy of the RG3-M gauge. We believe that our analysis results will be of great interest to both meteorologists and hydrologists who have been or want to be the RG3-M gauge users."

                "In this study, we first compared and investigated the accumulated mounts of 18 rainfall events of two RG3-M gauges benchmarked by the standard MG. Then, five typical rainfall events were chosen to further analyse the observed accuracy of the RG3-M gauge for different rainfall intensities at hourly temporal scale. Finally, the impacts of wind speed and rainfall intensity on the precipitation measurements of the RG3-M gauge were preliminarily explored. At the experiment field, the amount of liquid precipitation obtained from the MG was accurately measured after each rainfall event. All data from TBRs but for RG3-M record through a data acquisition system in time step of one minute."

In terms of the hourly rainfall process, the reliable measurement scope of the RG3-M gauge is ranging from 1.5 to 3mm/h; however, it should be noted that the underestimation is rather significant at the higher rainfall rates (>6mm/h). Last, it was found that rainfall intensity is a nonnegligible factor for influencing the measurement of the RG3-M gauge. But the windy effect seems to be insignificant in our experiments, which might be attributed to the similar exposure of the compared gauges."
