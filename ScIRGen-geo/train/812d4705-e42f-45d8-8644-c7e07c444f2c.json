            "description": "This dataset presents the dynamics of habitat quality in Key urbanized areas on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Huangshui Basin, Lhasa River Basin, Qinghai Lake Basin, and the middle and upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin) from 2020 to 2050 (with an interval of 5 years) under different socio-economic scenarios and expansion modes. Urban data under different socio-economic scenarios and expansion modes in 2020-2050 are derived from the published dataset of China's future urban expansion and urban growth boundary year by year, and land use data are derived from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences. By selecting cities as threat factors and considering the sensitivity of different land use types to urban threat factors, the habitat quality module in the InVEST model is used to quantify the habitat quality in the study area and produce this dataset.",

A_ Yyyy.tif, where q represents habitat quality, SSPx represents different socio-economic scenarios, a.a represents different expansion modes, and yyyy represents year, such as q_ SSP1_ 0.0_ 2050. tif represents the tiff file that describes the habitat quality in 2050 under the SSP1 socio-economic scenario with a mode parameter of 0.0. (2) Data reading method: The dataset is stored in tiff format, and users can use geographic information systems and remote sensing related software such as ESRI ArcGIS software, ERDAS software, and ENVI software to read data.",
