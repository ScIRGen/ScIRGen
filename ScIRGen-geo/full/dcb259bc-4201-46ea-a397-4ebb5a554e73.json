                    "Answer": "In the context of lithospheric structure analysis, 'joint inversion of P-wave receiver functions and surface wave dispersion' refers to a data collection method that combines two types of seismic dataâ€”P-wave receiver functions, which provide information about discontinuities and velocities beneath a seismic station, and surface wave dispersion data, which offers constraints on shear wave velocities at different depths. This joint inversion technique is used to derive a more accurate and comprehensive model of the S-wave velocity structure beneath a seismic station, particularly in regions like the Cathaysia where understanding the deep mechanisms linked to surface geological features such as granite exposures is essential.",

The choice is also guided by the constraints imposed by the shallow P-wave velocities, which are critical in accurately modeling the S-wave velocity structures beneath the seismic stations.",

By analyzing these velocity structures through joint inversion of P-wave receiver functions and surface wave dispersion, researchers aim to gain insights into the lithospheric characteristics of the region, which can shed light on geological processes and contribute to a better understanding of the area's subsurface dynamics.",
