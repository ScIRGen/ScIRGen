            "description": "The dataset of ground-based RPG-8CH-DP microwave radiometer and ground truth observations for soil freeze/thaw cycle was obtained in the A'rou foci experimental area from Mar. 10 to 11, 2008.\n     The radiometer was set 4.5m height above a smooth land, which was covered with snow less than 10cm deep. The field of view was roughly determined and not as ideal. Frozen soil was observed clockwise 240° and snow clockwise 270° with the truck head as the 0 degree azimuth; the elevation angle was set at -40° for the former, and from -20° to -70° for the latter. \n     Observation items included surface soil moisture (microwave drying to get the gravimetric moisture), the soil temperature by the thermal resistor and vegetation. The shallow layer of the site was covered with withered grass with exuberant roots underground due to rich organic. The soil temperature changes were reflected by the thermal resistor and recorded by the DataTaker.\n     The brightness temperature was archived as .BRT and .txt files (the ASCII format). Data in two formats were the same. Each row in .txt format was listed by year, month, date, hour, minute, second, 6.925GHz (h), 6.925GHz (v), 10.65GHz (h), 10.65GHz (v) , 18.7GHz (h), 18.7GHz (v), 36.5GHz (h), 36.5GHz (v), the elevation angle, and the azimuth angle. Values for 6.925GHz and 10.65GHz were zero due to disfunction.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of microwave radiometer observations, '亮温数据' refers to the brightness temperature data, which is collected by observing the microwave emissions from the ground. This data is available in two formats: one that is specific to the instrument's software and another in a universal text file format. Both formats include information such as the date, time, frequency bands, and the angles of observation, which are crucial for analyzing the microwave emissions from different surfaces like frozen soil and snow.",

                    "Answer": "The Truck Mounted Microwave Radiometer is used to collect brightness temperature data at various frequencies and angles, providing a remote sensing method for observing frozen soil and snow. In contrast, soil temperature is measured directly using thermistors, which rely on changes in resistance to detect temperature variations. The radiometer allows for a wider area of observation without direct contact, while thermistors provide precise point measurements. The radiometer data requires specific software to process, whereas thermistor data is calculated using calibration coefficients. Both methods are used simultaneously, offering complementary insights in frozen soil and snow monitoring.",

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves selecting a relatively flat snow-covered area and determining the radiometer's field of view with the instrument positioned 4.5 meters above the ground. Observations of permafrost are taken at an azimuth angle of 240 degrees and snow at 270 degrees, with elevation angles fixed at -40 degrees for permafrost and varying from -20 degrees to -70 degrees for snow. The surface soil moisture is measured using the microwave oven drying method to determine weight water content, while soil temperature is recorded using thermistors, with data automatically logged in a specific format that requires specialized software to access.",

The radiometer collects data in two formats, one of which requires specialized software for access.
