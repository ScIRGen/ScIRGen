                    "Answer": "The use of multiplicative versus replacement techniques for parameter correction in hydrologic response units can significantly affect model accuracy. Multiplicative techniques adjust parameters by scaling factors, which might preserve some relative relationships between parameters, potentially leading to improved model calibration when relative differences are critical. Replacement techniques, however, directly substitute parameter values, which can be beneficial when absolute values are more important. The choice of technique could impact the accuracy of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model's simulations of actual evapotranspiration and hydrological responses in the Senegal, Niger, and Chad Lake Basins.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures involve using a set of 16 parameters that are calibrated based on ETMonitor actual evapotranspiration (ETM ETa). Calibration includes defining the range (minimum and maximum) for each parameter, and then fitting values after calibration. Two correction techniques are employed: multiplicative, where parameters are adjusted proportionally, and replacement, where default values are substituted with calibrated values. These methods are adapted for each HRU in the different basins to provide accurate input parameters for the SWAT model.",
