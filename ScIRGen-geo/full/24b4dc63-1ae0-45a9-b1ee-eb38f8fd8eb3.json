            "description": "Radar penetration correction is essential for accurately estimating glacier mass balance when using the geodetic methods based on the radar-derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Due to heterogeneous snow distribution and snowpack properties, the radar penetration depth varies by region and is basically dependent on the altitudes. Therefore, this data set gives the result of the penetration depth difference of SRTM C/X-band radar on 1°×1° grid of High Mountain Asia Glaciers. The data set contains 214 1°×1° grids SRTM X-band and C-band penetration depth difference in HMA, and a linear fitting expression for each grid. According to the geodetic method, the 30 m SRTM X-band and C-band DEM are used to obtain the results of the penetration depth difference between the SRTM X-band and C-band of the 1°×1° high grid in HMA, and obtain the relationship between the SRTM X-C-band penetration depth difference and the elevation in the glacier area (for specific methods, please refer to references). The data is stored in excel files. Observational data can provide important basic data for studying the glacier mass balance in HMA, and can be used by scientific researchers studying climate, hydrology and glaciers.",

The 30-m freely available Space Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM, simultaneously acquired in February 2000 by C-band and X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, is one of the most widely used elevation data for regional glacier mass balance studies due to its wide coverage, high accuracy, and easy access. Radar with different wavelengths has different penetration depth into ice and snow due to radar volume scattering, in which microwaves interact with snow/ice through absorption, scattering, and refraction. In general, radar signals can penetrate several meters into ice and snow. Comparing the SRTM C/X-band DEMs on glacial areas was a common method to estimate the penetration depth into the snow of the SRTM C-band radar under the assumption of negligible X-band penetration. This method has been widely utilized to correct the penetration bias of SRTM C-band radar when estimating geodetic mass balance in HMA."

The C-band and X-band SRTM DEMs have the same horizontal reference (WGS84 datum); however, the DEMs have a different vertical reference (the C-band is the EGM96 geoid, and the X-band is the WGS84 ellipsoid), which requires an elevation reference transformation."
