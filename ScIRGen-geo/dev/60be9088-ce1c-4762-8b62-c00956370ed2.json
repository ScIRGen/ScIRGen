            "description": "This data includes the main trace geochemical data of the whole rock. The samples were collected from lalitoushan rock mass at the north end of the Changning-Menglian junction zone in western Yunnan. The main geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, and the trace elements are obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Based on the obtained data, it is considered that the initial magma is mainly composed of continental crust and the addition of mantle-derived components. The rock mass belongs to S-type granite, which originates from the partial melting of ancient crustal materials and is mixed with mantle-derived magma. It represents the product under the dynamic background of transformation from compression to extension in the post continental collision stage of Baoshan Simao block and has the material basis for mineralization, It has certain prospecting potential.",

This process is associated with the post-collision tectonic setting transitioning from compression to extension, providing the material basis for mineralization and exploration potential.",

The major geochemical data of whole rock samples are obtained using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, while trace elements are analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These methods enable researchers to conclude that the initial magma is primarily of continental crust origin with mantle-derived components, classifying the intrusive complex as S-type granite, which originated from partial melting of ancient crustal material and mixed with mantle-derived magma, representing a product of the post-collision stage of the Baoshan-Simao block's transition from compression to extension, providing a material basis for mineralization with certain exploration potential.",
