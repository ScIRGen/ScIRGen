            "description": "In order to understand the petrochemical and geochemical properties of the Hoh Xil ophiolite, the contents of major oxides, trace elements and rare earth elements in gabbros and basalts from gangqiqu, Xijin Ulan lake and Yishan Lake were determined. The bayinchauma ophiolite has the most complete compositions, including the main oxide compositions of two altered harzburgites determined by Deng Wanming using the specimens provided by Gou Jin. The contents of rare earth elements in these two samples were determined by plasma direct reading spectrometry at Peking University.\nThis data set records the contents of major oxides, trace elements and rare earth elements in ophiolites. It includes gabbros and basalts exposed in gangqiqu, Wulan lake and Yishan Lake in Xijin.\nIt comes from the field investigation and indoor determination of the scientific research team in this book.\nOphiolite, as a sign of suture zone, plays an important role in the study of the tectonic division of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and the formation and evolution of the plateau.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of geochemical studies, '稀土元素的含量测定' refers to the measurement of the content of rare earth elements within rock samples. This process often involves using techniques such as plasma emission spectroscopy to determine the concentration of these elements, which are crucial for understanding the geochemical properties of ophiolites.",

                    "Answer": "The geochemical patterns observed in major oxides, trace elements, and rare earth elements provide insights into the compositional diversity and geological history of the ophiolites. For instance, variations in rare earth element concentrations can indicate processes such as partial melting or fractional crystallization that occurred during the formation of these rocks. Additionally, differences in the major oxide compositions across various locations like Gangqiqu and Xijinwulanhu-Yishanhu may reflect distinct tectonic settings or metamorphic histories, offering clues into the tectonic evolution of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of specific sampling locations, such as Gangqiqu and the Xijinwulan Lake-Yishan Lake area, is likely influenced by the exposure of gabbro and basalt in these regions. These locations provide access to the most complete components of ophiolites, which are crucial for understanding the petrological and geochemical characteristics of the Hoh Xil ophiolites. The choice is also driven by the need to analyze the composition of outcrops, including the altered harzburgite samples measured for oxide content, to support research on the tectonic division, formation, and evolution of the Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "To accurately measure the major oxides, trace elements, and rare earth elements in ophiolite samples from regions such as Gangqiqu and Xijinu Lake-Yishan Lake, samples should be collected during field expeditions. These samples can include gabbro and basalt outcrops. The major oxides can be analyzed using standard geochemical techniques, while trace elements and rare earth elements can be measured using plasma emission spectroscopy, as demonstrated by the analysis conducted at Peking University. This involves precise calibration and careful handling of samples to avoid contamination and ensure reliable results.",
