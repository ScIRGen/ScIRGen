            "description": "A monthly data set of potential evapotranspiration based on the Penman-Monteith formula (1980-2018) of 1km on the Zoige Plateau. We collected daily meteorological data from 1980 to 2018 from the Meteorological Data Sharing Center of China Meteorological Administration, calculated daily-scale potential evapotranspiration through the Penman-Monteith equation, and accumulated daily-scale potential evapotranspiration to obtain monthly and annual potential evapotranspiration (PET mm/month) , Through the Anusplin professional meteorological interpolation software, the multi-year average annual temperature (MAT) and annual average precipitation (MAP) calculated by each meteorological station are interpolated to obtain a 1km resolution spatial data set.",

                    "Answer": "Using a 1km resolution spatial dataset derived from interpolated meteorological data may introduce interpolation errors, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates. The use of the Anusplin software for interpolation might help mitigate these errors by providing more refined spatial estimates. However, compared to using direct high-resolution meteorological data from multiple sources, the interpolated dataset might still lack some localized detail and accuracy, especially in areas with sparse meteorological station coverage. This method, while useful for broad-scale analysis, might not capture microclimatic variations as effectively as high-resolution direct data inputs.",

The daily potential evapotranspiration is computed using this equation and then accumulated to obtain monthly and annual potential evapotranspiration (PET mm/month).
