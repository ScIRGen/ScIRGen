            "description": "This data is monazite U-Pb age. The samples are collected from the light colored veins closely associated with the lead-zinc ore. after crushing, the heavy sand minerals are separated by manual elutriation. After magnetic separation and electromagnetic separation, monazite (about 500 grains) are picked out under binocular lens. After selecting representative monazite as target, the internal structure of monazite was studied by BSE through microscope transmission light and reflection light photography. U-Pb chronology was completed on 193 nm laser ablation system (new wave) and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS, Neptune) in the laboratory of Tianjin Institute of Geology and mineral resources. The average 206Pb / 238U surface age obtained from 21 survey points is 99.25 ± 0.78 MA (mswd = 1.60). This age represents the crystallization age of light vein closely related to lead-zinc mineralization. It is determined that the formation of the deposit is related to the hydrothermal solution in the late evolution of Cretaceous magmatic rocks. According to the comprehensive analysis of regional geochemical exploration and regional geological background, it is considered that the giant lead-zinc ore belt distributed in Tianshuihai Karakoram is controlled by Jurassic Cretaceous volcanic sedimentary basin and Cretaceous magmatic rocks. This metallogenic belt has great prospecting potential.",

                    "Answer": "U-Pb dating is a radiometric dating method used to determine the age of minerals by measuring the ratio of uranium isotopes (U) to lead isotopes (Pb) within a sample. In the context of geochronology, this method is applied to minerals such as monazite that contain uranium, using techniques like laser ablation and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) to accurately measure these isotopic ratios. The age is calculated based on the known decay rates of uranium isotopes to lead isotopes, providing insights into the crystallization age of the mineral, which can be associated with geological events such as ore formation.",

                    "Answer": "The U-Pb dating of monazite can provide insights into the crystallization age of ore-related light-colored vein bodies, which is important for understanding the timing of mineralization. In the context of Xinjiang's Karakorum, the data indicates a crystallization age of 99.25±0.78 Ma, suggesting that the formation of the ore deposit is related to the late-stage evolution of Cretaceous magmatic rocks and associated hydrothermal activities. This relationship highlights the influence of regional Jurassic-Cretaceous volcanic-sedimentary basins and Cretaceous magmatism on the mineralization process, suggesting significant exploration potential in the region.",

                    "Answer": "Consistent 206Pb/238U surface age values can be attributed to a meticulous sample preparation process, which includes hand-picking monazite grains after manual separation and magnetic selection, followed by detailed structural studies using BSE imaging. Additionally, precise U-Pb geochronology conducted with advanced equipment such as a 193 nm laser ablation system and MC-ICP-MS ensures accuracy, reflecting the close association with hydrothermal processes during the late Cretaceous magmatic evolution.",

                    "Answer": "Manual separation and selection of monazite grains can lead to high precision in isolating specific mineral samples relevant for U-Pb dating. This method allows for a detailed study of individual grains, enhancing the accuracy of the dating process. However, it may also introduce potential biases or errors if the selection process is not consistent, potentially impacting the interpretation of geological events such as the crystallization age of ore-related rock bodies and their relation to mineral deposit formation.",

This helps in confirming that the formation of the mineral deposit is related to the late-stage magmatic evolution of the Cretaceous period, which can significantly aid in identifying the metallogenic potential of the giant lead-zinc mineral belt controlled by Jurassic-Cretaceous volcanic-sedimentary basins and Cretaceous magmatic rocks in the region.",

After crushing, heavy mineral concentrates are manually separated. The monazite grains, approximately 500 in number, are isolated through magnetic and electromagnetic separation. Representative monazite grains are selected and mounted for target preparation. Microscopic examination, including transmitted and reflected light photography, is used to study the internal structure of the monazite grains using BSE imaging. U-Pb geochronology is conducted in a laboratory equipped with a 193 nm laser ablation system and a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). The resulting concordant 206Pb/238U surface age average is determined, which provides the crystallization age of the associated mineral deposits.",
