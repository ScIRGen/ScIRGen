The buried depth of the soil temperature probe was 0cm, 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm. The buried depth of the soil moisture sensor was 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 10cm, 10cm, 10cm, 20cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm.The average soil temperature was 2, 4cm underground.Soil hot flow plates (3) are buried in the ground 6cm.\nProcessing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) eliminate the moments with duplicate records;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the format of date and time is unified, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2017-6-1010:30.During January 1, solstice, April 15, there was a problem with the soil temperature sensor with a depth of 40cm, and the data was missing.\nGuo et al, 2020 is used for site introduction and Liu et al, 2013 for data processing",

Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

They provide material, dynamic, and thermal sources for weather systems at different scales and affect the water cycle process between the land and atmosphere. Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness only ranging from tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Because the observation scale of LAS matches well with satellite pixel scales and the grid scales of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth for pixel/grid scales in remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."

                    "Answer": "The challenges in applying MOST for LAS data include difficulties in achieving the ideal homogeneous and level surface conditions due to variations in land cover, surface flatness, and weather conditions. Furthermore, discrepancies exist in understanding the universal stability function fT, and issues of non-convergence during low wind speeds and stable nighttime conditions.",

                    "Answer": "Potential methodologies for estimating z0m over heterogeneous surfaces involve using remote sensing data to analyze roughness element characteristics like vegetation height and leaf area index. Analytical footprint models can be used to calculate z0m directionally, and heuristic parameterizations can be developed to relate z0m to these roughness characteristics.",
