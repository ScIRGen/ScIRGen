In order to monitor changes in the groundwater level and in the groundwater temperature in the cold region hydrology experiment area, six sets of instruments (the HOBO pressure type mario/thermograph: U20-001-01; U20-001-01-TI) were scattered by Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, CAS in the Yingke oasis, Xinmiao village in Daman township, Daman Water Management office, Wangqizha village in Xiaoman township, Yanhe village in Mingyong county, Xiaowan village in Wujiang township and Liuquan village in Xindun township respectively. The items were mainly the groundwater pressure and the groundwater temperature . Based on the air pressure obtained in the Yingke oasis station, the groundwater pressure by HOBO could be changed into the grounwater depth, and the groundwater level could be developed by differential GPS.",

                    "Answer": "A 'pressure-based water level sensor' refers to a device that measures the pressure exerted by water above the sensor, which can be converted into water depth. In the context of collecting groundwater data, it involves using instruments like the HOBO pressure-based water level temperature recorder to measure the pressure at the sensor location. The data collected includes both pressure and temperature, which can be used to calculate groundwater levels by combining the pressure data with local atmospheric pressure data.",

                    "Answer": "The hourly pressure and temperature data collected from multiple observation points in an arid region can provide insights into the variability and trends of groundwater levels over time. By analyzing the pressure data, researchers can calculate changes in groundwater levels, which may indicate responses to seasonal weather patterns, agricultural irrigation practices, and potential climate change effects. Furthermore, temperature data can give clues about thermal influences on groundwater, possibly revealing interactions between surface water and groundwater or subsurface temperature changes due to environmental or anthropogenic factors.",

The choice of locations, like town sites and villages, was likely based on their representative nature for the study area, while the use of HOBO pressure water level and temperature loggers (models U20-001-01 and U20-001-01-TI) was probably driven by their ability to record precise measurements at an hourly frequency. The setup was designed to enable the calculation of groundwater depth and elevation, considering atmospheric pressure data from a nearby oasis station.",

                    "Answer": "Using automated pressure-based water level and temperature sensors, such as the HOBO models, allows for high-frequency data collection with a one-hour interval, which enhances the accuracy and reliability of monitoring groundwater changes over time. This method also enables the conversion of pressure data to water depth and elevation, providing comprehensive insights into groundwater dynamics. However, the accuracy depends on the proper calibration of sensors and the integration of atmospheric pressure data to account for variations in external pressure, which could otherwise affect the precision of water level measurements.",

The equipment used includes HOBO pressure water level and temperature recorders. These devices record data hourly. To convert pressure data into water depth, atmospheric pressure data from a meteorological station is used. Additionally, differential GPS is employed to measure the elevation of groundwater wells accurately, which, combined with the water depth, allows for the calculation of the water level elevation.",
