            "description": "This data set is a geochemical data set of granitoids in hengduan Mountain area. The total amount and components of rare earth elements in the kangdian paleocontinent, Ailaoshan-Jinshajiang, Lincang-Zuo Gong and Luxi-Tengchong granite belts in Hengduan Mountain area are studied. The ree abundance, variation and distribution patterns of various rocks are discussed, and the genetic types of granites are preliminarily discussed. Isotope geochemistry study, using strontium and neodymium isotope system tracing method, it is helpful to understand the genesis and material source of granitoids. For this reason, the isotopic compositions of strontium and neodymium in the granitoids of the four rock belts, including diorite, granodiorite, porphyritic biotite monzonite, potassic feldspar granite, alkali feldspar granite, hornblende biotite monzonite porphyry and alkali feldspar syenite, have been studied. It is helpful to study the geochemical related aspects of granites.",
