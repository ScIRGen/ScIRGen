                    "Answer": "Land cover/use data refers to information about the physical material at the surface of the earth, such as vegetation, urban infrastructure, water, and other land types. In the context of high-resolution remote sensing and environmental management, it involves using high-resolution imagery to interpret and identify different types of land cover and land use based on various factors like climate, elevation, and terrain. This process may include field verification to validate land types that the imagery cannot capture, ensuring the accuracy and updating of the land use classification to support ecological management efforts.",

This method provides detailed information about the surface cover types, enabling more accurate verification and correction of land use types. Consequently, it enhances the current and timely effectiveness of ecological governance in the Qilian Mountain region.",
