            "description": "1:100000 vegetation map of Heihe River Basin, the regional scope is subject to the Heihe river boundary of Huangwei Committee, the area is about 14.29 × 104km2, the data format is GIS vector format, this version is version 3.0. The data is mainly based on ground observation data, integrated with all kinds of remote sensing data, 1:1 million vegetation map, climate, terrain, landform, soil data mapping, and compiled by cross validation. The classification standard, legend unit and system of vegetation map of the people's Republic of China (1:1000000), 2007 are adopted, including vegetation type group, vegetation type, formation and sub formation. The new version mainly unifies the codes of the new formation (74 codes in total, distinguishing the formation and the sub formation). 9 vegetation type groups, 22 vegetation types and 74 formations (sub formations) in version 2.0 were changed into 9 vegetation type groups, 22 vegetation types and 67 formations (7 sub formations).\nThe data includes versions 2.0 and 3.0",
