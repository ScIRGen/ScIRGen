These objectives are essential for understanding climate change impacts in the Third Pole region, which includes the Tibetan Plateau, Pamir Plateau, and Tianshan. To achieve these goals, data is gathered over specific periods (2000-2016 for current data and decadal changes since the 1960s) to provide comprehensive coverage and facilitate the analysis presented in the paper supported by these datasets.",
