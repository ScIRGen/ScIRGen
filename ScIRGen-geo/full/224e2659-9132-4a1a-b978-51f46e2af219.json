            "description": "The riverbed surface of the main channel in Nyangqu river is composed of gravel particles with wide grain size distribution. there are abundant gravel particles on the beach and riverbed. In this investigation, the bed surface grain size distribution of the main channel and tributaries of the Nyangqu river was measured. This data set contains the information of the five sampling locations in five main channels and two locations in tributaries of the Nyangqu River Basin (Table 1) and the bed surface grain size distribution (Table 2). The sampling locations were generally selected near the cross-section with obvious riverbed. It was considered that water flow through these sections in the straight channel for a long. At the same time, because it was a dry season, the bed grain size distribution on the river beach could be considered as the movement of gravel bedload carried by the last flood season. Therefore, it was considered that the bed grain size distribution in the sampling area on the river beach in the dry season was the bedload size distribution in the flood season. The grain size distributions were measured by the automatic identification method of full particle size based on image processing (e.g., Baserain software), with high identification accuracy of sediment particles is high. It is of great value to the scientific research on the evolution of source to sink process，bedlaod transport, and flood numerical simualtion， as well as the basic research on the flash flood prevention and control.",

This results in a more accurate model of sediment transport processes that are critical for understanding flood dynamics, riverbed evolution, and designing effective flood prevention strategies.",

This method provides high accuracy in identifying sediment particle sizes on the riverbed. Challenges in this procedure may include ensuring accurate image capture under varying environmental conditions, managing image resolution and quality, and dealing with potential interference from water reflections or debris.
