            "description": "By archaeological investigation and excavation in the Tibet Plateau and neighbouring areas, we discovered Jinchankou site, Zongri site, Xinancheng cemetery, bangga site and Tshem gzhung kha thog. In this dataset, there are some basic informations about these sites, such as location, longitude, latitude, altitude, material culture and so on. On this Basis, we identified and analysed stone artifacts, animal remains and plant fossil, and obtained a batch of dating data of radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating;identification and isotopic composition and quality indicators of animal remains and plant fossil. At the same time, the relevant animal and plant remains and isotopes in the Tibet Plateau and neighbouring areas are sorted out. This dataset provide important basic data for understanding when and how human lived in the Tibet Plateau and neighbouring areas during the Neolithic Age and historical period.",

This approach enables researchers to ascertain the types of resources utilized by these communities, their dietary habits, and their interactions with the environment. It provides essential data such as radiocarbon and luminescence dating, animal residue identification, plant residue identification, and isotope analysis, which together help reconstruct the activities, cultural attributes, and survival strategies of the Neolithic to Bronze Age inhabitants in the region.",

Basic information like latitude, longitude, elevation, cultural attributes, and cultural artifacts are collected. Stone tools and plant-animal remains are then scientifically collected, identified, and subjected to laboratory analysis, resulting in data such as carbon-14 dating, optically stimulated luminescence dating, animal skeletal identification, plant remain identification, and related isotope data. Additionally, a systematic organization of related plant-animal remains and isotopes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas is conducted.",
