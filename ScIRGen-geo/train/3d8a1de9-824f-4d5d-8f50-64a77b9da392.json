            "description": "The data are major and trace elements of chaceqiao, zhangjialing, Yucun and zhaojialing granodiorite and granite porphyry in Jiangnan transitional zone, zircon Lu HF, U-Pb isotopic analysis of granite and in-situ S isotopic analysis of pyrite. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis, and the pyrite in-situ S isotopic la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the above analysis, the diagenetic age of related intrusive rocks in Yucun gold deposit is obtained, and the tectonic background and material source are studied to reveal the possible formation mechanism of gold deposit, so as to guide the follow-up work of mineral exploration.",
