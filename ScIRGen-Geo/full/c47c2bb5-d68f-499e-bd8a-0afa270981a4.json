            "description": "The distributed eco hydrological model needs high-precision precipitation spatial distribution information as input. Due to the scarcity of stations, the station interpolation precipitation can not reflect the spatial distribution of precipitation in Heihe mountain area. The regional climate model (RCM) simulation results provide the information of precipitation elevation relationship at different locations. The relationship is corrected according to the observed precipitation elevation gradient of hulugou watershed, and the precipitation elevation gradient at different locations of the watershed is obtained. Based on the gradient and the multi-year average value of precipitation observed at the station, the precipitation climate background field is established to represent the multi-year average spatial distribution of precipitation in the basin. Then, based on the daily precipitation observation data of 16 meteorological stations and 25 hydrological stations, and the precipitation spatial distribution information provided by the precipitation climate background field, the daily grid precipitation data is obtained by interpolation.            \nThe interpolation year of this data is 1960-2014, the spatial interpolation precision is 3-km, and the time precision is day by day data (the daily period is from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. the next day). The results show that the interpolation precipitation is reliable.            \nThe data is stored in ASCII file. The file name of each file is in the form of precyyyymmdd.asc. Yyyy is the year, mm is the month and DD is the day. Each ASCII file represents the grid precipitation data of the day, in mm.",

                "AnswerEn": "In high mountainous watersheds, there are few meteorological stations located at high elevations, making it difficult to represent the spatial distribution of precipitation accurately. The interpolation based on stations at low elevations is often unrepresentative for high elevations, and gauges are generally sparse in these areas.",
                "AnswerCn": "在高山流域中，高海拔地区的气象站数量较少，这使得准确表示降水的空间分布变得困难。基于低海拔站点的插值往往无法代表高海拔地区的情况，而这些地区的雨量计通常也很稀疏。",

                "AnswerEn": "A spatial interpolation method that combines meteorological observations and regional climate model outputs helps by using the adjusted annual precipitation–elevation gradient to generate a gridded daily precipitation climatology. This approach provides a more accurate representation of precipitation spatial distribution, especially in areas with limited station data.",
                "AnswerCn": "一种空间插值方法结合了气象观测和区域气候模型输出，通过使用调整后的年降水量-海拔梯度生成网格化的日降水气候数据。这种方法提供了降水空间分布的更准确表示，特别是在观测站数据有限的地区。",
