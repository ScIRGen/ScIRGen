Based on the grid temperature data of Heihe River Basin from 2000 to 2009, the freezing and thawing state of surface soil is divided into three kinds: unfreezing state, incomplete freezing state and complete freezing state. Complete freezing means that the soil is completely frozen in the whole month. Incomplete freezing refers to soil freezing days ≤ 30 days but ≥ 1 day in a month, and the soil has freeze-thaw cycle. Non freezing means that the soil will not freeze this month. The data is in the form of grid, which can be opened in ArcGIS. 1 represents unfrozen state, 2 represents unfrozen state, 3 represents fully frozen state",

                "Spatial and temporal variations of seasonally frozen ground extent have important impacts on carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface, surface energy balance, hydrologic cycle, and ecosystems as a whole. In the Northern Hemisphere, the areas of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground account for 24% and 57% of the exposed land surface, respectively. In terms of area, China is the third largest frozen ground country in the world, with the permafrost area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau being about 220 × 10^4 km^2, accounting for about 23% of China's land area, while the total area of seasonally frozen ground exceeds 80%. Seasonal freezing layers refer to soil layers that freeze in winter and thaw in summer near the surface, with a perennially thawed layer below, formed by heat exchange under cold season negative air temperature conditions. Seasonal thawing layers refer to soil layers near the surface in permafrost regions that melt, which can connect with underlying permafrost, formed by heat exchange through the surface under warm season positive temperature conditions. The repeated freeze-thaw cycles of near-surface soil layers directly affect the soil's thermal and physical properties, as well as water and heat exchange between the ground and atmosphere, and have a significant impact on carbon cycling between the ground and atmosphere."

The maximum of freezing probability occurs in January, while the minimum of probability occurs between June and July.
