            "description": "Active layer thickness in mountians shows strong spatial heterogeneity mainly due to the complex terrain. In this data set, the active layer thickness in the upper reaches of Heihe River Basin is systematically investigated by ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and other traditional methods. Compared with other direct measurement methods, the error is about 8 cm, indicating a high reliability. This data set can provide detailed field data for understanding the active layer thickness in this area and can provide evaluation datasets for the land surface model, especially for permafrost research.",
