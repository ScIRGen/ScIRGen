            "description": "Debris flow in Nanfeng area is a natural disaster phenomenon caused by the combination of many natural factors. It is affected by the terrain, geology and climate. Therefore, the formation and development of debris flow fully reflect the organic combination of various natural factors. The modern geomorphic process in Nanfeng area is very active, and the glaciation, canyon flow and slope physical and geological processes are very strong. The data analysis shows that due to the sharp rise of the ground and the strong invasion of the Yarlung Zangbo River water system, most of the gullies are V-shaped, short and steep, and the vertical gradient of the gully bed is large, about 500 ‰ in the upper reaches and about 400 ‰ on average, and 250-300 ‰ in the middle and lower reaches. This kind of steep valley terrain is easy to form debris flow under the action of turbulent current. Under the action of gravity, landslides and collapses occur continuously in the valley. According to the investigation, most of the terrain slopes favorable for the formation of debris flow in Nanfeng area are above 30 degrees, and the upper valley slope in this area can generally reach 40-50 degrees, and the maximum can reach 60-70 degrees. The middle and lower valley slopes are also between 35-40 degrees, which are favorable for the development of debris flow.",
