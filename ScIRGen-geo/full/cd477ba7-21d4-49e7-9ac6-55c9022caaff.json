            "description": "Terrestrial actual evapotranspiration (ET), including evaporation from soil and water surfaces, evaporation of rainfall interception, transpiration of vegetation canopy and sublimation of snow and glaciers, is an important component of the terrestrial water cycle and links the hydrological, energy, and carbon cycles. The dataset of ETMonitor-GlobalET-2013-2014 is obtained based on ETMonitor model, which combines parameterizations for different processes and land cover types, with multi-source satellite data as input. Several remote sensing based variables, e.g. net radiation flux and dynamic water body area, and meteorological variables from ERA5 reanalysis dataset, were used as input to estimate daily ET. The ET estimation is conducted at daily temporal step and 1km spatial resolution, and the generated global ET dataset is at 5km resolution and daily time step for publication. The data type is 16-bit signed integer, the scale factor is 0.1, and the unit is mm/day.",

Satellite earth observation data has been proven to be able to provide accurate estimates of regional ET at different spatial scales. The most popular algorithms for continental or global scale ET estimation include surface energy balance models based on visible to infrared observations, and the micro-meteorological models based on the optical and microwave remote sensing data. However, it was restricted in cloud-free conditions and difficult to provide continuous ET information at high resolution since it relied heavily on the land surface temperature retrieved from thermal infrared bands. Clearly, the current global ET algorithms based on satellite earth observation suffered enormous problems as illustrated above."
