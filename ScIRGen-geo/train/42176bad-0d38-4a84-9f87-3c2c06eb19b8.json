            "description": "Terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and Groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) hold paramount significance in hydrological research and water resource management. However, products derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions are constrained by the satellite's design and variations in processing strategies among different institutions, resulting in multiple suboptimal products. These products not only exhibit coarse spatial resolution but also suffer from a continuous 11-months gap (from July 2017 to May 2018), thereby imposing significant limitations on related research. To simultaneously address the aforementioned three challenges, the Bayesian-based Three-Cornered Hat (BTCH) method was initially employed to fuse low-uncertainty GRACE-derived TWSA/GWSA products with coarse resolution (0.5°). Subsequently, based on the fused TWSA/GWSA products and multi-source datasets, a Machine Learning Downscaling Framework based on Physically Constrained Sliding Window (MLDF-PCSW) was developed in this study. This framework not only enhanced the spatial resolution of the products but also filled the data gap, ultimately producing a long-term and continuous dataset on the global (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), named High-resolution Water Storage Anomaly (HWSA v1.0) which incorporates the information (Variables: TWSA and GWSA; Spatial resolution: 0.05°; Temporal resolution: monthly; Time spans: April 2002 to December 2022). The results of the uncertainty analysis with the Three-Cornered Hat (TCH) method indicate that the TWSA derived from the Center for Space Research (CSR) exhibits the lowest uncertainty (25.38 mm) within the three original products, and the uncertainty decreases by 35.07% (16.48 mm) after fusion with the BTCH method. The HWSA v1.0 dataset based on MLDF-PCSW not only preserves the original information of the fused TWSA/GWSA products but also delineates more detailed spatial details, demonstrating excellent performance compared to the data before downscaling in terms of correlation coefficients (CC) and root mean square error (RMSE) (TWSA: CC=0.99, RMSE=0.68 mm; GWSA: CC=0.99, RMSE=1.24 mm) and showing good consistency with in-situ groundwater observations with the maximum CC value of 0.96. The comparison results with the other four gap-filled TWSA products also show outstanding performance with the average CC value reaching 0.98 in the world. Obviously, the HWSA v1.0 datasets have enormous potential to provide a robust data foundation for related research endeavors.",

                "The applications of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) on local scales are obstructed owing to the coarser spatial resolution of GRACE observations. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites provide an effective measure to detect terrestrial water storage changes at large-scale regions, particularly in areas with limited measured data. Up to now, GRACE has been widely utilized in a number of applications, e.g., retrieving groundwater, quantifying drought, measuring massive flood, and detecting land subsidence. Despite these achievements, there are still some shortcomings which limit its application in long-term hydrological changes, e.g., data gaps and time lag. Additionally, care must be taken when GRACE observations are applied to regions with heterogeneous geomorphological features. Especially, the footprint of GRACE observations is approximately 200,000 km² as a result of the orbit height, which is too coarse to meet the requirements of water resource managers. Improving the spatial resolution of GRACE satellites has the great potential to enhance wider applications of GRACE data. There are two commonly used methods to downscale GRACE observations, namely dynamical and statistical approaches. The dynamical downscaling can also be called as data assimilation (DA), which integrate GRACE observations and simulated water storage estimates from hydrological models. Previous studies have highlighted the benefit of DA in improving the spatial resolution of GRACE data and disaggregating terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) into various water storage components. Nevertheless, the principal drawback of DA is computational cost and strong dependence on the uncertain boundary condition of hydrological models. The statistical approaches can be considered as alternatives; for example, recent demonstration with GRACE data to name a few. With the advancement of machine learning (ML) techniques, the statistical methods become more feasible. In statistical downscaling models, it is crucial to identify representative predictors for the performance of model prediction, while no effective variable selection method has been proposed yet. Most predictors are chosen based on the subjective experience or water balance method, and thus these developed models may not be uniformly applicable to other areas."

It was found that there was 3.20 times deviation of the results from the model simulation in computation of groundwater depletion rates within plain areas. In-situ water level measurements highlight that the downscaling models are improved by 36.95 % and 23.25 % in correlation relative to the original GRACE data and the simulated groundwater storage anomalies, respectively. Generally, the pixel-scale model is slightly better than the regional-scale model with 69 % (171 out of 249 observation wells) of higher correlation and 53 % (131 out of 249 observation wells) of smaller root mean squared error."

However, no effective variable selection method has been proposed yet, leading to predictors often being chosen based on subjective experience or the water balance method. This variability may limit the models' applicability to different regions and affect the accuracy of downscaled results.",

These differences lead to multiple suboptimal products, complicating the fusion process. The discrepancies must be addressed to reduce uncertainties and enhance the quality of the fused GRACE data, which is essential for producing high-resolution and temporally continuous datasets for more effective hydrological research and water resource management.",

For example, the uncertainty in TWSA products decreased by 35.07% (from 25.38 mm to 16.48 mm) after fusion. This approach also improves the spatial resolution of the data from 0.5° to 0.05°, allowing for more detailed spatial information.",

The original GRACE observations have a coarse spatial resolution, which limits their utility at smaller scales. By enhancing the resolution, researchers aim to provide more detailed spatial information that can support better understanding and management of water resources, including groundwater consumption and irrigation use.",
