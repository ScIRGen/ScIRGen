                    "Answer": "A distributed eco-hydrological model, such as the GBEHM used in the field above, refers to a model that simulates eco-hydrological processes across a spatially distributed grid (e.g., 1-km grid) over a specified region, like the upper reaches of the Heihe River. It integrates ecological and hydrological processes to predict variables like precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and temperature with a focus on spatial and temporal resolution.",

                    "Answer": "The dataset provides monthly precipitation data which, when analyzed alongside runoff depth, can help infer how variations in precipitation affect runoff in the region. This could indicate trends in water availability and potential flood risks, reflecting broader climate change impacts over the specified time frame and spatial resolution.",

                    "Answer": "Using a 1-km spatial resolution in the distributed eco-hydrological model can influence the granularity and detail of the simulation outputs, potentially improving the accuracy of spatial distribution data for precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff depth, and average temperature. This level of resolution allows for more precise modeling of hydrological processes and ecological dynamics across the specified region, which could lead to more reliable predictions and assessments of future climate scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "The key objectives of modeling future climate scenarios and simulating eco-hydrological processes in the upstream region of the Heihe River over a 50-year period include understanding the spatial distribution and temporal changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff depth, and average temperature at a fine spatial resolution of 1 km. This can help in assessing the potential impacts of climate change on water resources and ecological conditions, thereby supporting effective water management and policy-making for the region.",

This model outputs data in ASCII format, and the spatial range of the basin is defined in the reference directory under the basin.asc file. The projection parameters used for modeling are based on the Sphere_ARC_INFO_Lambert_Azimuthal_Equal_Area projection, which helps maintain spatial accuracy at this resolution.",
