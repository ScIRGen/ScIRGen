            "description": "The data set includes the mass balances of Hailuogou Glacier, Parlung No.94 Glacier, Qiyi glacier, Xiaodongkemadi Glacier, Muztagh No.15 Glacier, Meikuang Glacier and NM551 Glacier in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau from 1975 to 2013. Based on several mass balance observations collected from World Glacier Inventory (https://nsidc.org/data/g10002/versions/1) and The Third Pole Environment Database (http://en.tpedatabase.cn/, doi:10.11888/GlaciologyGeocryology.tpe.96.db) by Tandong Yao and the meteorological data obtained from Global Land Assimilation System (GLDAS) (meteorological variables, including precipitation, air temperature, net radiation, evaporation on snow surface, and snow depth, in the central grid of each glacier are extracted from GLDAS data set shown in meteo.xlsx), the mass balances of the above seven glaciers from 1975 to 2013 are reconstructed by using the glacier material balance calculation formula. This reconstruction data is based on the published glacier material balance data to calibrate the parameters in the glacier material balance formula, and to reconstruct the long-time series material balance by using the glacier material balance formula, in which the parameter calibration results and the reconstruction results of the long-time series data are compared with the relevant research results, demonstrating the rationality of the data results Please refer to the following papers. The data can be used to study the change of water resources in the glacial region, expand the data set of Glacier Mass Balance in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, and provide reference for the future research of Glacier Mass Balance reconstruction.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of glaciology data collection, '冰川物质平衡重构' refers to the process of reconstructing glacier mass balance over a given period. This involves using historical observation data, such as those collected in the World Glacier Inventory and other glacier mass balance observation platforms, along with meteorological data from sources like the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The reconstruction is achieved by calibrating the parameters within a glacier mass balance calculation formula, allowing for the creation of a long-term series of mass balance data for glaciers. This reconstructed data can be used for studying water resource changes in glacier regions and enhancing existing glacier mass balance datasets.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for reconstructing long-term glacier mass balance sequences in the specified region involve using observational data from the World Glacier Inventory and the Third Pole Environment Database, along with meteorological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System. These methods are then applied to the glacier mass balance calculation formula to reconstruct long-term sequences. This approach can be compared to other regions where different observational data sources, meteorological inputs, or computational methods might be employed, potentially leading to variations in accuracy, data availability, and the ability to validate results against existing research outcomes.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating meteorological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System with glacier observation data from multiple inventories can enhance the accuracy and reliability of glacier mass balance reconstructions by providing a comprehensive dataset that accounts for various meteorological factors such as precipitation, near-surface air temperature, net radiation, snow evaporation, and snow depth. This integration allows for a more thorough calibration of glacier mass balance formula parameters and facilitates long-term sequence reconstructions, which have been validated against existing research findings, demonstrating the reasonableness of the data outcomes. This approach can also extend the dataset for glaciers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, contributing to the study of water resource changes in the region and serving as a reference for future glacier mass balance reconstruction research.",

Meteorological data, including precipitation, near-surface temperature, net radiation, snow surface evaporation, and snow depth, can be obtained from datasets such as the Global Land Data Assimilation System. These datasets provide meteorological elements for each glacier's geometric center grid. The reconstruction involves calibrating parameters in the glacier mass balance formula using the published observation data and applying this calibrated formula to reconstruct long-term mass balance data from 1975 to 2013 for the specified glaciers. The results are then compared with related research findings to ensure the data's validity.",
