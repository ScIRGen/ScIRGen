                "Central Asia (CA) is a typical arid and semi-arid region in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent. It is characterized by scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems that are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change (Liu et al., 2020). Under the context of global warming, CA has experienced profound climate warming since the 20th century, much faster than the global land average (Giorgi, 2006; Huang et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020). In response to global change, extreme temperature (e.g., heatwave) and precipitation (e.g., drought and heavy precipitation) events have occurred more frequently and intensely in CA in the last 50 years than ever before (Reyer et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2020). Most studies on projecting precipitation changes and extremes in CA have been based on GCM simulations (Wu et al., 2013; Reyer et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021). However, due to their limited resolutions, global climate models (GCMs) simulations have significant biases relative to the observed climate variables such as temperature and precipitation over CA (Reyer et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020). Regional climate models (RCMs) produce finer resolution information about regional climate changes than GCMs do (Mannig et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2017, 2022; Zhu et al., 2020). Statistical downscaling (SD) models are a practicable tool to bridge the scale gap between climate model simulations and station observations."

                "In this study, we proposed a statistical downscaling (SD) model based on quantile delta mapping to assess and project eight precipitation indices at 73 meteorological stations across CA driven by ERA5 reanalysis data and simulations of 10 global climate models (GCMs) for present and future (2081-2100) periods under two shared socio-economic pathways (SSP245 and SSP585). In this study, we applied an SD model based on QDM to evaluate and project daily precipitation and extremes across CA, so as to gain a deeper understanding of the response of the station-level extreme precipitation to global warming, and to further obtain more accurate prediction of extreme precipitation at meteorological stations in CA at the end of the 21st century than GCMs, which is very imperative for local climate change impact assessment."
            ],
            "challenges": [
                "However, global and regional climate models often fail to reproduce the observed daily precipitation distribution and hence extremes, especially in areas with complex terrain. Due to the high computational cost, RCM is difficult to be applied in the study of multi-model ensemble projection and uncertainty. Moreover, simulated precipitation outputs from GCMs and even RCMs usually exhibit considerable biases partly because the model data represent area averages over grid boxes, while observations are derived from rain gauges at specific point locations. In fact, at the grid scale, the intensities of extreme precipitation events simulated using GCMs and RCMs are usually much weaker than those observed at weather stations (Elizabeth et al., 2010)."

                "The QDM algorithm was adopted in this study to downscale the future daily precipitation at a station by combining the QM algorithm with a quantile delta change approach (Cannon et al., 2015). The QM algorithm was applied to interpolate the missing precipitation data of the 73 stations in CA using the daily gridded precipitation data from APHRODITE as inputs. The cross-validation method was used to evaluate the performance of the SD model (Fan et al., 2013). The SD model was used to project the changes in the precipitation indices toward the end of the 21st century under scenarios SSP245 and SSP585, and then, the results were compared with the results of the raw GCM simulations to assess the added value of the SD model."

                "Daily precipitation observations in the five countries in CA were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Historical Climatology Networks (GHCN). Due to a lack of daily precipitation data for most of the stations in CA since 2005, only data from 73 stations with less than 25% missing data in the entire period from 1979 to 2005 were adopted. The daily gridded precipitation dataset (APHRODITE) developed by Yatagai et al. (2009, 2012) was used to interpolate the missing precipitation data at the selected stations in CA. The daily gridded precipitation from the European Centre for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth generation atmospheric (ERA5) reanalysis data with a spatially horizontal resolution of 2.5° × 2.5° for 1979-2005 was used to force the proposed SD model before the SD model was applied to the GCM simulations. The 10 CMIP6 GCMs were selected (Table 1). The historical simulations for 1979-2014 and future projections of the daily precipitation under scenarios SSP245 and SSP585 from 2015 to 2100 were applied to downscale the daily precipitation at 73 stations."

                "The SD model effectively reduces the biases and RMSEs of the modeled precipitation indices compared to the observations. Also, it effectively adjusts the distributional biases in the downscaled daily precipitation and indices at the stations across CA. Our SD multi-model ensemble projections project significant and robust increases in SDII and total extreme precipitation (R95PTOT) of 0.5 mm/d and 19.7 mm, respectively, over CA at the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) compared to the present values (1995-2014). More pronounced increases in indices R95PTOT, SDII, number of very wet days (R10MM), and RX1DAY are projected under the higher emission scenario (SSP585), particularly in the mountainous southeastern region. The SD model suggested that SDII and RX1DAY will likely rise more rapidly than those projected by previous model simulations over CA during the period 2081-2100."

                    "Answer": "The steps involve using a QDM algorithm to downscale future daily precipitation at a station by combining the QM algorithm with a quantile delta change approach. The QM algorithm interpolates missing data, and cross-validation evaluates the model's performance. The SD model is then used to project precipitation indices changes under different scenarios and compare these with raw GCM simulation results.",
