            "description": "The samples in this data set are mainly collected from 2013-2019 and sporadic river sediment samples from 2001-2013. The data set contains the sampling location information of 40 main stem samples and 107 tributary samples, petrographic data of 62 river sediment samples, heavy-mineral data of 145 river sediment samples, and geochemical data of 55 samples. The petrographic data were collected with Gazzi-Dickinson method with grain size window at 63-2000 μm. The heavy minerals are separated from 32-500 μm sediment with the heavy liquid (2.90 g/cm3) and liquid Nitrogen, and then counted the heavy minerals depend on the mineral's optical properties and Raman spectroscopy. The geochemical analysis were tested for sediment < 2000 μm. The data of petrography and heavy minerals were collected in the laboratories of  University of Milan-Bicocca and Nanjing University, respectively. The geochemical data were completed by the Institute of Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. All the results are true and reliable. This data set systematically reflects the sediment compositions of different tributaries and different tectonic domains (Tethys Himalayan terrane, Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone, Lhasa Block, etc.) in the Yarlung Tsangpo drainage. With the high-resolution compositional dataset, the distribution characteristics of modern sediment derived from different lithology/rivers in the Southern Tibet can be obtained, which also provide the reference for deep time provenance comparison. Meanwhile, combined with the forward mixing model, we can calculate that the Lhasa Block contributes ~80% of the sandy sediments to the Yarlung Tsangpo drainage, which can be up to 5 times higher than the contribution of the Tethys Himalaya, whereas the sediment contribution from the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone is only less than 5%.",

                    "Answer": "To accurately extract and analyze heavy mineral data from river sediments in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin, the procedural method involves using heavy liquid separation (density 2.90 g/cm3) and liquid nitrogen cooling techniques to extract minerals from sediment sizes ranging from 32-500μm. Optical properties and Raman spectroscopy assist in identifying and statistically analyzing each heavy mineral component. These methods help differentiate sediment sources and contributions, showing, for example, that the Lhasa Block contributes approximately 80% of the sandy sediments in the basin, significantly more than the Tethyan Himalayan terrane and the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone.",
