It utilizes multispectral sensors with a ground sample distance of 32m and a swath width of 600km.

In this context, it means imagery captured by the Beijing-1 satellite, which includes bands like near-infrared (760nm-900nm), red (630nm-690nm), and green (520nm-620nm) with a spatial resolution of 32 meters.",

The spatial resolution is a compromise between capturing detailed spatial information and covering large areas, given the satellite's orbital parameters and swath width.",
