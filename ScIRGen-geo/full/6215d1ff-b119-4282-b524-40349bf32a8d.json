                "Net primary productivity (NPP) denotes the total amount of organic dry matter accumulated by green plants with respect to the unit time and area. NPP is the residual part of the total amount of organic matter produced by photosynthesis after the elimination of autotrophic respiration. As the core content of the carbon budget and climate change research, NPP serves as an important indicator to determine the ecosystem health and sustainable development level. Therefore, analyzing and discussing the spatial-temporal change patterns and the driving mechanisms of NPP in a regional vegetation ecosystem not only are of significance to understand the response of this ecosystem to climate change, but also can provide a scientific basis for ecological environment protection, plant yield estimation, resource exploitation, effective management of natural resources, and formulation of the corresponding social and economic development strategies. The unique geographical location, altitude, climate and geomorphological conditions of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau in China result in various climatic and ecosystem types. As a special geographic unit, the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau exhibits an important role in regulating and indicating global change; it is considered to be the ''natural laboratory'' for studies of climate change in the world."

Furthermore, the relative effects of climate change and human activities on the NPP changes were also quantitatively distinguished.

                "The average annual NPP in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest during 2000–2015. With respect to the inter-annual changes, the average annual NPP exhibited a fluctuating upward trend from 2000 to 2015, with a steep increase observed in 2005 and a high fluctuation observed from 2005 to 2015. In the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, the regions with the increase in NPP (change rate higher than 10%) were mainly concentrated in the Three-River Source Region, the northern Hengduan Mountains, the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the eastern parts of the North Tibet Plateau, whereas the regions with the decrease in NPP (change rate lower than –10%) were mainly concentrated in the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Ali Plateau. The gravity center of NPP in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau has moved southwestward during 2000–2015, indicating that the increment and growth rate of NPP in the southwestern part is greater than those of NPP in the northeastern part. Further, a significant correlation was observed between NPP and climate factors in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. The regions exhibiting a significant correlation between NPP and precipitation were mainly located in the central and eastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, and the regions exhibiting a significant correlation between NPP and temperature were mainly located in the southern and eastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Furthermore, the relative effects of climate change and human activities on the NPP changes in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau exhibited significant spatial differences in three types of zones, i.e., the climate change-dominant zone, the human activity-dominant zone, and the climate change and human activity interaction zone."
