            "description": "The dataset of ground-based microwave scatterometer and ground truth observations for soil freeze/thaw cycle was obtained in No. 3 quadrate of the A'rou foci experimental area from 22:33 on Mar. 16 to 15:00 on 17, 2008.\n     Observation items included the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the soil temperature at 5cm and 10cm by the glass geothermometer, the soil temperature, soil volumetric moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, and the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, and soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3). Those provide reliable ground data for retrieval and validation of soil moisture and freeze/thaw status from active remote sensing approaches. \n     Two files were included, the microwave scatterometer and ground truth observations; both were archived in Excel format.",
