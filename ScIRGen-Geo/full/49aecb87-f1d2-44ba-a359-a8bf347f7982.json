        "Drought is among the most damaging natural disasters in the world. It often causes extensive damages to crops and natural ecosystems, creates water shortages, and increases risks of heat waves and wildfires. Many studies have shown that drought may become more severe and widespread as the greenhouse gas (GHG)-induced global warming continues in the twenty-first century. Although precipitation deficits are often the primary cause for historical droughts, large increases in atmospheric evaporative demand or potential evapotranspiration (PET) under a warming climate are considered as a major cause for the widespread drying under global warming. Furthermore, decreases in precipitation frequency and increases in the number of dry days could further enhance surface drying even if the precipitation amount increases. All analyses of model-simulated changes in soil moisture and drought indices show increased drying and increased frequency of drought over many land areas in the twenty-first century as GHGs increase. The commonly defined dryland areas (with annual precipitation P/PET ratio < 0.65) are also expected to increase by ~10% in the twenty-first century under a high emissions representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. However, the magnitude of the drying and changes in drought severity vary substantially among these studies, and they depend on the indices as well as the future emissions scenarios analyzed."

        "However, soil moisture (SM) and runoff (R) have been poorly simulated in global climate models partly because of coarse model resolution (which lead to poor representation of land hydrological processes), as reflected by the very large range of change for these two fields among the global models used by IPCC (Meehl et al. 2007; Collins et al. 2014). This apparent discrepancy has yet to be resolved."

        "The CMIP5 simulations from 14 coupled global climate models (Table 1; other models were unavailable at the time we started the analysis) were analyzed in this study. The monthly data for precipitation, surface air temperature, net radiation, specific humidity, wind speed, air pressure, top 10-cm layer SM content, and total R were first regridded onto a 2.58 grid using a scheme that conserves the quantify locally and globally. The regridded model variables were used to calculate the Penman–Monteith PET and sc_PDSI_pm at each grid box following Dai (2011b). The monthly PET and sc_PDSI_pm from 1900 to 2099 were computed for each of the model runs and then averaged over the model runs to derive the multimodel ensemble-mean sc_PDSI_pm. The drought frequencies based on the sc_PDSI_pm, SM and R were derived for each model run first and then averaged over the models to derive the multimodel ensemble-mean change. To analyze how the sc_PDSI_pm varies because of changes in individual meteorological forcing, we calculated the sc_PDSI_pm separately for each model run and for each case in which only one forcing factor was allowed to change while all others were kept at the values of the 1970s for any decades outside the calibration period (1950–79), during which all the variables were allowed to vary as in the all-forcing case."

        "The results show that the broad change patterns are consistent among the three different types of drought defined using the current percentile values of the sc_PDSI_pm and normalized SM and R anomalies, although large differences exist in their change magnitude, which is not surprising given that these are measures of different types of drought. Further, the relationships among these three drought indices are comparable in the current and future climates, suggesting that these indices are likely to be valid for measuring future droughts. All these indices suggest large increases (up to 50%–200% in a relative sense) in frequency for future moderate and severe drought over most of the Americas, Europe, southern Africa, and Australia."
