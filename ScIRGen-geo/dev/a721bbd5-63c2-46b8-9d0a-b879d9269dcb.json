            "description": "The data set is based on the GPP simulated by 16 dynamic global vegetation models (TRENDY v8) under S2 Scenario (CO2+Climate) and represents the gross primary productivity of the ecosystem. Data was derived from Le Qu é r é  Et al. (2019). The range of source data is global, and the Qinghai Tibet plateau region is selected in this data set. Original data is interpolated into 0.5*0.5 degree by the nearest neighbor method in space, and the original monthly scale is maintained in time. The data set is the standard model output data, which is often used to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of gross primary productivity, and compared with other remote sensing observations, flux observations and other data.",

                    "Answer": "Total primary productivity (GPP) in the context of ecological datasets refers to the measure of the amount of carbon dioxide that is converted into organic compounds by plants through photosynthesis. It is modeled using dynamic global vegetation models, such as the ones used in the TRENDY v8 project under S2 scenarios (CO2+Climate), which simulate GPP to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem productivity.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives are to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem gross primary productivity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by using simulations from dynamic global vegetation models under the S2 scenario (CO2+Climate). This involves understanding how GPP varies over time and across different regions and comparing these model outputs with other data sources such as remote sensing and flux observations, which provides both practical significance and theoretical value.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve using dynamic global vegetation models such as TRENDY v8 under S2 scenarios (CO2+Climate) to simulate gross primary productivity (GPP). The simulation data, originally global, is constrained to the specific region of interest, such as the Tibetan Plateau. Spatial interpolation is applied using the nearest neighbor method to achieve a resolution of 0.5 degrees, while maintaining the original monthly temporal scale. This approach provides a standard model output used to assess the temporal and spatial patterns of gross primary productivity, which can be compared with other remote sensing observations and flux measurements.",
