            "description": "Carbon particles are an important radiative forcing factor in the atmosphere. Their concentration and composition vary greatly in time and space, especially in remote areas. This data set reports the total suspended particulate matter (TSP), total carbon (TC) and water insoluble particulate carbon (IPC) of PM2.5 at two stations in the remote area of the eastern Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Hongyuan) Δ 14C and δ 13C, the area is affected by severe air pollution from southwest China. The contribution rates of TC fossil fuels in TSP and PM2.5 samples are 18.91 ± 7.22% and 23.13 ± 12.52% respectively, which are far lower than those in Southwest China, indicating the importance of non fossil contributions from local sources. TC in TSP samples at study site δ 13C is 27.06 ± 0.96 ‰, which is between long-distance transport sources (such as the southwest region) and local biomass combustion emissions. This data supplements the database of carbon aerosols in the east of the Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Carbonaceous aerosol isotopic data refers to the measurement of isotopic ratios, such as Δ14C and δ13C, in carbon-containing particles suspended in the atmosphere. These isotopic signatures help in distinguishing the sources of carbon, such as fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning, and are crucial for understanding the radiative forcing properties of aerosols, particularly in remote areas like the eastern Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in the δ13C values of TC in TSP samples could suggest that the carbon sources are a mix of distant transport sources, such as those from the southwestern regions, and local biomass burning emissions. The δ13C value of 27.06±0.96‰ indicates a blend between these sources, reflecting the significant influence of local non-fossil contributions in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The use of isotopic data of carbonaceous aerosols from remote sites on the eastern Tibetan Plateau helps in understanding the relative contributions of local versus long-range transported pollution sources. The data indicate that the fossil fuel contribution to total carbon in TSP and PM2.5 samples is significantly lower than in the broader southwestern region of China, suggesting a larger role of local non-fossil sources. This information enhances the database of carbon isotope composition in the region and provides insight into the impact of local biomass burning emissions compared to distant sources.",

The data aims to assess the impact of severe air pollution from southwestern China and to highlight the importance of local non-fossil sources. Additionally, it contributes to the database of carbon isotope data for carbonaceous aerosols in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.",
