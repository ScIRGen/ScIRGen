            "description": "The medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) is a sensor mounted on the ENVISAT satellite of the European Space Agency. It has 15 spectral segments and scans the earth's surface by push sweep method. The incident angle of the point below the star is 68.5 degrees and the width is 1150km. \nAt present, there are 56 ENVISAT MERIS data in Heihe River Basin.

Challenges in achieving geometric correction could stem from the sensor's scanning methodology, which involves a push-broom technique with a wide swath of 1150 km and a sub-satellite point incidence angle of 68.5 degrees. These characteristics can introduce geometric distortions that need to be carefully addressed during processing.",

This data collection aims to provide detailed spectral information of the Earth's surface over the Heihe region, assisting in remote sensing research and analysis. By gathering data at various dates, the project seeks to enhance understanding of environmental changes and applications in the region, contributing to broader research goals such as monitoring land cover, assessing water resources, and studying the impacts of climate change.
