            "description": "The Shannon Index is a measurement index based on information theory. When analyzing and comparing the diversity and heterogeneity changes of different landscapes or different periods of the same landscape, the Shannon Index is an important indicator that reflects landscape heterogeneity and is sensitive to the uneven distribution of various patch types in the landscape, emphasizing the contribution of rare patch types to information. Analyzing the Shannon index within the Sanjiangyuan National Park can reflect the ecological integrity situation. This dataset is based on land use data (LUCC) and was calculated using the landscape pattern software Fragstats. The Shannon Index resolution of Sanjiangyuan National Park in 2015 and 2020 was 100m.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in the Shannon diversity index, which is sensitive to the unequal distribution of patch types and emphasizes the contribution of rare patch types, can indicate changes in landscape heterogeneity. In a national park setting, such variations may reflect the level of ecological integrity, as they capture the diversity and distribution of different land cover types. By analyzing these indices, researchers can infer changes or threats to ecological balance and identify areas requiring conservation attention.",

The index is sensitive to the uneven distribution of patch types within the landscape, emphasizing the contribution of rare patches to overall information. By examining the diversity index, researchers can gain insights into the heterogeneity of the landscape and monitor changes in biodiversity and ecosystem health over time, especially between the years 2015 and 2020 using land use data (LUCC) and calculated through landscape pattern software like Fragstats.",
