            "description": "This dataset includes the concentrations and spatial pattern of mercury (Hg) in the soil of the southern Tibetan Plateau. Two hundred thirty nine soil samples were collected, and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry (CVAFS) was used to analyse the Hg contents. The limit of detection (LOD) for this method is 1.8 ng/g. The standard reference material, soil GB GSS-2, which is supplied by National Institute of Metrology P.R.China, was also analyzed for assessing the accuracy of this method, and the recoveries of this method were 84%-103%. This dataset will provide the informations of soil Hg contamination and background values over the southern Tibetan Plateau.",
