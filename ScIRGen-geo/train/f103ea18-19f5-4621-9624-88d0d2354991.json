This technique could introduce potential sources of error during georeferencing and vectorization, affecting the spatial accuracy and detail of the dataset. However, it also enhances usability by allowing for digital manipulation and analysis, improving accessibility for applications such as regional planning, geological hazard monitoring, and mineral exploration.",

                    "Answer": "Using scanned and georeferenced paper maps in ArcGIS 10.5 for creating digital geological structure maps can lead to several outcomes. The georeferencing process allows for the transformation of paper maps into a digital format, improving accessibility and usability for various applications such as regional planning and geological surveys. However, the accuracy of the digital maps heavily depends on the precision of the georeferencing and vectorization processes. Potential challenges include distortions from the original scanning process and errors introduced during manual digitization. These factors could affect the data's accuracy and the effectiveness of its application in decision-making and analysis.",
