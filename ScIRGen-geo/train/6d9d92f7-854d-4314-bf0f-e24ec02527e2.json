Wang Yifeng, Kong Dezhen, Wang Shaoqing\nPublishing: Map Press\nIssue: Xinhua Bookstore\nYear: 1979\nScale: 1: 4,000,000\n  It took five years to complete from May 1972 to July 1976. In the process of drawing legends and mapping, referring to the vast majority of vegetation survey data (including maps and texts) after 1949 in China, we held more than a dozen mapping seminars involving researchers from inside and outside the institute. During the layout after the mapping work was completed, many new survey data were added, especially vegetation data in western Tibet.\n  The nature of this map basically belongs to the current vegetation map, including two parts of natural vegetation and agricultural vegetation. The legend of natural vegetation is arranged according to the seven vegetation groups. They are mainly divided according to the appearance of plant communities and certain ecological characteristics. The concept of agricultural vegetation community, like the natural vegetation community, also has a certain life form (appearance, structure, layer), species composition and a certain ecological location.\n  In 1990, the State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information Systems of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences completed the digitization of this map, and wrote relevant data description documents. The digitized data also adopt equal product cone projection and can be converted into other projections by GIS software.\nThis data includes a vector file in e00 format, a Chinese vegetation coding design description, a dataset description, a vegetation data layer attribute data table, and a scanned \"People's Republic of China Vegetation Map-Brief Description\" and other files.\nData projection:\nProjection: Albers\nfalse_easting: 0.000000\nfalse_northing: 0.000000\ncentral_meridian: 110.000000\nstandard_parallel_1: 25.000000\nstandard_parallel_2: 47.000000\nlatitude_of_origin: 0.000000\nLinear Unit: Meter (1.000000)\nGeographic Coordinate System: Unknown\nAngular Unit: Degree (0.017453292519943299)\nPrime Meridian: Greenwich (0.000000000000000000)\nDatum: D_Unknown\nSpheroid: Clarke_1866\nSemimajor Axis: 6378206.400000000400000000\nSemiminor Axis: 6356583.799999999800000000\nInverse Flattening: 294.978698213901000000",
