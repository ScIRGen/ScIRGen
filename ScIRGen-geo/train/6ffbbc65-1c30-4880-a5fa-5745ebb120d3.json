            "description": "Due to global warming, the water storage changes in the Tibetan Plateau are significant. The accompanying vertical load deformation contributes to the uplift of the plateau's crust. Accurately calculating vertical load deformation is crucial for understanding the tectonic movements of the Tibetan Plateau. By effectively obtaining the trends of hydrological and oceanic load mass changes in the near and far fields of the plateau from 2003 to 2016, and calculating the vertical load deformation rate field of the Tibetan Plateau at a 0.125°×0.125° resolution based on Green's function convolution, the inaccuracies caused by spectrum truncation and the introduction of unrealistic load mass sources in GRACE spherical harmonic coefficient-based load deformation calculations are avoided. The vertical load rate field in this dataset can be used for load corrections at GNSS stations and for obtaining tectonic deformation results.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP; Figure 1a) was formed approximately 50 million years ago because of the continuous northward movement of the Indian Plate and the collision and compression of the Eurasian Plate (Molnar & Tapponnier, 1975). At present, the TP is still one of the most active tectonic regions in the world, and it is constantly uplifting and expanding. Our understanding of the current uplift state of the TP has benefited from the development of Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides us with crustal displacement data (Liang et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2018). The vertical displacement observed using GPS is contributed by the hydrological load displacement (load uplift or subsidence) and tectonic displacement (tectonic uplift or subsidence). Typically, the vertical displacement due to the mass load is calculated based on the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and the spherical harmonic analysis method. However, because the GRACE data are truncated at lower harmonic degrees and tectonic mass changes are contained in the GRACE-derived mass changes, the validity of using GRACE data to estimate the load displacement of the TP is questionable and needs further discussion. Mass changes caused by tectonic movement are contained in GRACE observations. Under climate change, the TP has warmed much faster (0.36 ± 0.08°C/decade) than both the global average (0.19 ± 0.02°C/decade) and the Northern Hemisphere (0.26 ± 0.03°C/decade), and this accelerated warming has led to increased glacier melting and permafrost degradation, resulting in lake enlargement (Zhang, Chen, et al., 2019)."

We claim that the load displacement effect for any GPS station should be calculated by Green's function method based on global hydrological data. Thus, in this study, the validity of using GRACE data to estimate the load displacement is discussed. Then a reasonable approach is presented to compute the load effect. Finally, the distribution of the load effect over the TP and the corresponding corrections to GPS observations are presented."

However, because the GRACE data are truncated at lower harmonic degrees and tectonic mass changes are contained in the GRACE-derived mass changes, the validity of using GRACE data to estimate the load displacement of the TP is questionable and needs further discussion. Therefore, we only applied the traditional and more widely used SH products to estimate the load displacement of the TP. Thus, the GRACE-derived load displacement only reflects the regional average load effect (low-frequency information), and it is hard to correct the GPS velocities (full-degree information)."

We found that the average effect of the hydrological load displacement on the TP uplift is 0.15 ± 0.12 mm/yr, while the average uplift of the plateau observed by GPS is 0.92 mm/yr. Therefore, the contribution of the hydrological loading to the uplift of the TP is 16%."

                    "Answer": "The limitations arise because GRACE data are truncated at lower harmonic degrees, and tectonic mass changes are contained in the GRACE-derived mass changes. This leads to the GRACE-derived load displacement only reflecting the regional average load effect, which is low-frequency information, making it difficult to correct GPS velocities that require full-degree information.",

The computation of the vertical load deformation rate field requires an effective acquisition of regional and global hydrological and oceanic load mass change trends, which can be achieved using Green's function convolution.",
