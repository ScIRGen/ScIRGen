            "description": "This data set includes daily average data of atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, net radiance, and atmospheric pressure from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2016 derived from the Integrated Observation and Research Station of the Alpine Environment in Southeast Tibet. \nThe data set has been used by students and researchers in the fields of meteorology, atmospheric environment and ecological research. \nThe units of the various meteorological elements are as follows: temperature °C; precipitation mm; relative humidity %; wind speed m/s; wind direction °; net radiance W/m2; pressure hPa; and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm μg/m3. \nAll the data are the daily averages calculated from the raw observations. Observations and data collection were carried out in strict accordance with the instrument operating specifications and the guidelines published in relevant academic journals; data with obvious errors were eliminated during processing, and null values were used to represent the missing data. \nIn 2015, due to issues related to the age of the observation probe at the station, only the wind speed data for the last 8 months were retained.",

This suggests that aging equipment can lead to incomplete datasets, which may affect the reliability and comprehensiveness of the data collected. It highlights the importance of regularly updating and maintaining equipment to ensure consistent and accurate data collection.",
