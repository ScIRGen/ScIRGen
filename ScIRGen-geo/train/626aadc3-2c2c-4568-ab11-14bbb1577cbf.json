The data was collected as part of a major application project organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which involved the collaboration of 19 research institutes specializing in remote sensing technology. The project employed a layered land cover classification system with 6 primary categories and 31 secondary categories, contributing to its high precision and utility in national land resource surveys, hydrology, and ecological research.",

The data collection is based on Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM imagery over a three-year period. A layered land cover classification system is then applied, dividing the area into six primary categories (such as arable land and forest) and 31 secondary categories. This method ensures high precision and usefulness for applications like national land resource surveys, hydrology, and ecological research.",
