            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Sidaoqiao Superstation in the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2020. There were BLS900, BLS450 and RR-RSS460 at Sidaoqiao Superstation. The north towers were set up with these instruments’ receivers and the south towers were transmitters. The site (north: 101.137° E, 42.008° N; south: 101.131° E, 41.987 N) was located in Ejinaqi, Inner Mongolia. The underlying surfaces between the two towers were tamarisk, populus, bare land and farmland. The elevation is 873 m. The effective height of the LAS was 25.5 m, and the path length was 2350 m. The data were sampled 1 minute.\nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 exceeded the saturated criterion (BLS900&BLS450：Cn2>7.25E-14，RR-RSS460：Cn2>7.84 E-14). (2) The data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS900&BLS450：Average X Intensity<1000；RR-RSS460：Demod>-20mv). (3) The data were rejected when collected during precipitation. (4) The data were rejected if collected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). In the iteration process, the universal functions of Thiermann and Grassl (1992) and Andreas (1988) were selected for BLS900 and RR-RSS460, respectively. Detailed can refer to Liu et al. (2011, 2013). Due to instrument adjustment and inadequate power supply, the date of missing data for the large aperture scintillator is: 2020.02.13-2020.02.14；2020.05.18-2020.15.19。\nSeveral instructions were included with the released data. (1) The las data are firstly from BLS900, followed by BLS450, and finally the final missing data was marked with-6999. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: Date/time (yyyy/m/d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xlsx format. \nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "A large aperture scintillometer is an instrument used to measure flux data, specifically sensible heat flux, in surface process observation networks. It operates by sending a beam of light between a transmitter and a receiver, measuring the fluctuations in the light intensity caused by the refractive index structure parameter of the air, denoted as Cn2. This measurement helps in calculating the sensible heat flux using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory through iterative computation. The instrument is typically installed at a certain height above the ground and aligned over a specified path length to cover different types of land surfaces.",

For BLS900 and BLS450, data is removed if Cn2 > 7.25E-14 or if Average X Intensity < 1000. For RR-RSS460, data is removed if Cn2 > 7.84 E-14 or if Demod > -20mv.

These procedures ensure the reliability and accuracy of the derived sensible heat flux, which is calculated using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and requires quality data inputs.",

It can result in more comprehensive data coverage and may compensate for periods of instrument malfunction by providing alternative data sources.

Iterative calculations are performed using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, selecting stability universal functions specific to the scintillometer models used (Thiermann and Grassl for BLS900&BLS450, Andreas for RR-RSS460).",
