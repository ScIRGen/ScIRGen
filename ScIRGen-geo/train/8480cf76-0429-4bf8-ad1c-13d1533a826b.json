            "description": "Longwave downward radiation (LWDR) is an important driving parameter in climate and hydrological models. Compared to traditional ground-based measurements, remote sensing has unique advantages in estimating global LWDR. There is still much room for improvement of the existing remote sensing LWDR products in terms of accuracy, spatio-temporal resolutions, and the ability to explain and quantify the changes of longwave radiation at various scales. To overcome these limitations, this paper developed a new global LWDR product with improved accuracy (the RMSE < 30 W/m2 over the globe), high temporal resolution (hourly), and spatial resolution (5 km) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. It serves as a LWDR product within the framework of spatiotemporally seamLess remote sensing dataset for the earth system Radiation budget (referred to as LessRad). As the first long-term high-resolution, spatiotemporally continuous LWDR product (2002-2022, 1 h, 5 km), the LessRad reveals its advantages in studying the spatiotemporal variability of LWDR on finer scales. It also provides a valuable data source for various applications, such as analyzing land-atmosphere interactions and quantifying climate feedback, and thus, is potentially helpful for understanding the earth's energy budget and dynamics.",
            "instructions": "The file is named LessRad_LWDR_YYYYDDD_5km_1hour_v1.nc, where LWDR stands for Surface LongWave Down Radiation, YYYYDDD represents the date (YYYY being the year and DDD indicating the day of the year), 5km indicates a spatial resolution of 5 kilometers, 1hour refers to a time resolution of 1 hour (mean), v1 denotes the first version of the data, and nc signifies that the file is in netCDF4 format. For example, LessRad_LWDR_2002101_5km_1hour_v1.nc represents the LWDR on the 101st day of 2002, measured in W/m². Each file contains 24 hours of downwelling longwave radiation data.  For more detailed descriptions, please refer to the self-description information within the NC data. Usage involves reading the data using programming languages such as ArcGIS, Python, IDL, etc., with the conversion formula: Y = scale_factor * DN + add_offset.  where Y is the real physical quantity, specifically LWDR, DN is the digital quantization value, and scale_factor along with add_offset are the conversion coefficients stored within the nc file.",

Accurately understanding LWDR is indispensable to the greenhouse effect, the global energy cycle, and climate feedback studies. Compared to traditional ground-based measurements, remote sensing enables wide-scale and periodic coverage of both global and local regions, presenting a promising approach to meet the growing demand for LWDR applications. Although satellite-based LWDR products have been widely applied in various disciplines, their coarse spatial resolutions (≥100 km) and insufficient accuracy make it difficult to detect changes in LWDR at smaller scales. Accurately capturing the diurnal variations of LWDR can provide a deeper understanding of large-scale climate change, and ecological and surface processes."

There is still much room for improvement of the existing remote sensing LWDR products in terms of accuracy, spatiotemporal resolutions, and the ability to explain and quantify the changes of longwave radiation at various scales.

The validation data were collected from 292 sites distributed worldwide, covering a wide range of geographical regions and climate conditions. First, an improved version of parameterization only based on CTT, ST, and TCWV is employed to generate all-sky instantaneous LWDR.

Compared to ERA5 or CERES, LessRad provides significantly closer LWDR values to ground measurements. LessRad showed a high global performance with an R value of 0.91, an MBE of 5.5 W m−2, and an RMSE of 29.7 W m−2. Validation based on ground measurements revealed that LessRad, CERES, and ERA5 show global RMSE values of 27.8, 30.8, and 29.6 W m−2, respectively. Moreover, not only at the global scale but also in different local regions, such as the Tibetan Plateau, the Arctic, the Antarctic, and midlatitudes, the accuracy of LessRad surpasses that of other products. In dry regions, LWDR is more likely to exhibit greater uncertainty. In addition, LessRad improves the accuracy and shows a noticeable advantage in spatial resolution. With its higher spatial resolution, LessRad facilitates the fine-scale investigation of surface radiation budgets for different land cover types, enabling long-term quantification of climate impacts with exceptional performance. The comprehensive validation reveals that it shows obvious advantages at the regional scales in terms of both accuracy and spatial pattern, demonstrating its better applicability under complex terrain and various climatic conditions."
