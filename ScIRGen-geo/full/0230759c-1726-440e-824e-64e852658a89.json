            "description": "Net primary productivity (NPP), as the basis of ecosystem material and energy cycle, can reflect the carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation at regional and global scales, and is an important indicator to evaluate the quality of terrestrial ecosystem. Based on the principle of light use efficiency model, the productivity model of ecosystem in national barrier area was established by coupling remote sensing, meteorology, vegetation and soil type data. In the selection of parameters, the photosynthetic effective radiation (APAR) was calculated from GIMMS NDVI 3gv1.0 data, vegetation map of China, total solar radiation and temperature and humidity data. Compared with the soil water molecular model, the regional evapotranspiration model can simplify the parameters and enhance the operability of the model. The net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial vegetation in 1990-2015 over the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was estimated based on the parameterized model with par and actual light use efficiency as input variables of CASA model.",

Measurements on primary productivity in specific areas can quantify the input of organic matter to food webs, and so are of critical ecological importance as well. A quantitative assessment of the ocean’s primary productivity (the rate at which carbon dioxide is reduced to organic matter by marine phytoplankton photosynthesis) is a critical variable in understanding the ecology and biogeochemistry in marine systems. Phytoplankton, being the base of marine food webs, grow at different rates in the ocean, rates that are regulated by temperature, nutrients, and irradiance; they are in turn grazed by herbivorous organisms that both incorporate the autotrophic organic matter into their own tissues, as well as recycle it by oxidizing a portion for energy use and release."

Annual productivity calculated from the means throughout the growing season equalled 146 g C m-2 yr-1. Mean chlorophyll concentration in the euphotic zone (the 1% irradiance level) was 2.85 ± 2.68 mg m-3 (maximum concentration was 19.1 mg m-3). Maximum photosynthetic rates at the surface (normalized to chlorophyll) averaged 0.94 ± 0.71 mg C (mg chl)-1 h-1, similar to the maximum rate found in photosynthesis/irradiance measurements. Productivity measurements are consistent with the temporal patterns of biomass found previously, with biomass and productivity peaking in late December; mixed layers were at a minimum at this time as well. Estimates of plankton composition also suggest that pre-January productivity was largely driven by the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica, and summer productivity by diatoms."
