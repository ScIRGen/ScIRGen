      "description": "This dataset includes 11 tree-ring width sequences and tree-ring timelines in Central Asia. In the areas with little influence from human activities and natural disasters, conifer species with thinner soil layer, steeper slope, longer tree age and clear annual rings should be selected. The tree core sample was drilled about 1.3m above the ground using a growth cone. A total of 555 cores from 275 cypress trees were collected, air-dried, fixed in special wooden troughs using white latex, and sanded until clear. The tree ring width is measured using the Velmex measuring system. The COFECHA program was used for cross-dating, and the tree ring width sequence was finally established. Based on dendrochronology data of 16 low-altitude mountains in Central Asia, the relationship between growth and climate factors of Juniperus seravschanica in low-altitude mountains in Central Asia is studied. The growth changes of Juniperus seravschanica in low-altitude mountains in Central Asia in the 21st century are predicted by the established model. The growth of Juniperus seravschanica in the study area is mainly controlled by precipitation, which is mainly affected by tropical sea surface temperature. During the recent warm period, increased precipitation and warmer temperatures combined to promote the growth of Juniperus seravschanica.",
