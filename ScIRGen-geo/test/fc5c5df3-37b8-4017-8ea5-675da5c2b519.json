            "description": "The data set describes the hypocentre parameters of intermediate- and deep-focus earthquakes in the Pamir-Hindu Kush region from 1964 to 2011. The earthquake relocation results clarified the complex deformation characteristics of underground structures in the deep subduction area in the Pamir-Xindu Kush region. The seismic waveform data are from the IRIS website (http://ds.iris.edu/wilber3/find_event), and the arrival time data are from the ISC website (http://www.isc.ac.uk/) and the CEDC website (http:// Data.earthquake.cn/data/index.jsp?id=11number=9). Seismic location was determined using the teleseismic waveform fitting and the multi-scale double-difference (Multi-DD) method developed in this study. The errors in latitude and longitude data are approximately ±7 km and ±7 km, respectively.\n\nOrigin Time: yyyy (year), mm (month), dd (day), hh (hour), mm (minute), ss.ss (second)\nEarthquake Magnitude: Magnitude (from the ISC seismic catalogue)\nEarthquake Location: Latitude, Longitude, Depth\nHypocentre determination method: Hypocentres marked with an \"F\" were determined by the waveform fitting method",

                    "Answer": "When employing multi-source data collection methods, such as waveform fitting and multi-scale double-difference techniques, the precision of seismic event detection is likely to improve. This is because the combination of different data sources, such as waveform data and event catalog data from IRIS, ISC, and CEDC, allows for a more comprehensive analysis. The use of different methodologies enhances the accuracy of the event location by providing multiple perspectives on the event's parameters. According to the field information, the longitude and latitude errors are reduced to ±4 kilometers and the depth error to ±7 kilometers, suggesting a higher precision level than would be expected from a single-source method.",
