            "description": "The dataset contains phenological camera observation data collected at the Arou Superstation in the midstream of the Heihe integrated observatory network from June 13 to November 16, 2018. The instrument was developed with data processed by Beijing Normal University. The phenomenon camera integrates data acquisition and data transmission functions. The camera captures high-quality data with a resolution of 1280×720 by looking-downward. The calculation of the greenness index and phenology are following 3 steps: (1) calculate the relative greenness index (GCC, Green Chromatic Coordinate, calculated by GCC=G/(R+G+B)) according to the region of interest, (2) perform gap-filling for the invalid values, filtering and smoothing, and (3) determine the key phenological parameters according to the growth curve fitting (such as the growth season start date, Peak, growth season end, etc.) There are also 3 steps for coverage data processing: (1) select images with less intense illumination, (2) divide the image into vegetation and soil, and (3) calculate the proportion of vegetation pixels in each image in the calculation area. After the time series data is extracted, the original coverage data is smoothed and filtered according to the time window specified by the user, and the filtered result is the final time series coverage. This data set includes relative greenness index (Gcc).\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for sites information in the Citation section.",

Additionally, data processing involves calculating indices like the relative greenness index (GCC) and requires effective methods for filling invalid values, filtering, and smoothing to determine key phenological parameters. Preprocessing images to select appropriate lighting conditions and segmenting images into vegetation and soil are also critical steps.",

This is achieved through the calculation of the relative greenness index, which helps in analyzing vegetation dynamics and changes over time. Additionally, the process involves data pre-processing, image segmentation, and smoothing of the time series data to accurately determine coverage and critical phenological parameters.",

For calculating vegetation greenness, the relative greenness index, or Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC), is computed using the formula GCC=G/(R+G+B), where R, G, B are the pixel values of the red, green, and blue channels of the image. This involves filling invalid values and smoothing the data to fit growth curves and determine key phenological parameters such as the start of the growing season, peak, and end of the growing season. For coverage, the images are preprocessed by selecting those with moderate lighting, segmented into vegetation and soil, and the proportion of vegetation pixels in the area of interest is calculated. The time series data is then smoothed to produce the final coverage data.",

This includes the integration of data acquisition and transmission functions, and the calculation of the relative green chromatic coordinate (GCC) based on image pixel values.
