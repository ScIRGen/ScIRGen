            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Dashalong station eddy covariance system (EC) in the upstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 9 to December 31 in 2023. The site (98.9406° E, 38.8399° N) was located in the Qilian County in Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3739 m. The EC was installed at a height of 4.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500RS) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. \nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) and Che et al. (2019).",

                    "Answer": "Eddypro software processes raw 10Hz eddy covariance data into 30-minute averages by performing steps such as outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction, and density corrections. It also includes quality evaluation based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity tests. Data are further screened to exclude erroneous, precipitation-affected, or incomplete data. This approach ensures high-quality data by applying multiple corrections and rigorous quality checks, which may differ from other methods that might apply fewer corrections or use different criteria for data quality assessment.",

The dataset employs methods such as removing data around precipitation events and correcting for various biases to address these challenges.",

These steps include outlier removal, time delay correction, double coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic virtual temperature correction, and WPL correction for density. The quality of the flux values is evaluated by testing atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Additionally, data selection is applied to remove erroneous data from instrument errors, data collected one hour before and after precipitation, and data with more than 10% missing within each 30-minute period. The average period for observation data is 30 minutes, and missing data are marked as -6999.",

Software like Eddypro processes this data into useful 30-minute intervals, with corrections for delay time, coordinate rotation, frequency response, and density (WPL) adjustments, enabling accurate flux calculations even in complex high-altitude meadow environments.",
