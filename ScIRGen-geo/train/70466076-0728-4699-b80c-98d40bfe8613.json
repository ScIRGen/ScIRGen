            "description": "The dataset of LST (Land Surface Temperature) observations was obtained by three handheld infrared thermometers (5# and 6# from Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, and also one from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources, which were all calibrated) in the Linze station foci experimental area.\n     The temperature was measured 14-30 times in 40 subplots of the west-east desert strip on May 24, 25 and 28, 2008, 12-30 times in 9 subplots of north-south strip on May 24, 25 and 28, 17 times from P1 to P6 strips on Jul. 4 and 8, three times of 147 points along LY06 strip on Jun. 6, 15, 29 and Jul. 11, LY07 strip on May 30, Jun. 6, 15, 29 and Jul. 11 and LY08 strip on May 30, Jun. 6 and 10, and three times in Wulidun farmland quadrates on May 25, Jun. 29 and Jul. 11. Calibration was carried out in the desert on May 25, and in Pingchuan reservoir on May 30. Data were archived as Excel files. \n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",
