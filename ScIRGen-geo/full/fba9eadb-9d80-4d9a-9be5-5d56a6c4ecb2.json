            "description": "the high-power tensor CSAMT utilizes two separate or overlapped sources to measure 10 EM field components of the two sources (Ex1, Ex2, Ey1, Ey2, Hx1, Hx2, Hy1, Hy2, Hz1, and Hz2). It is suitable for the exploration of underground geologic bodies with complex geological or anisotropic characteristics, and its effective measurement range consists of eight sectors with an angle of 25°. In this manner, the high-power tensor CSAMT can be used to determine impedance tensor elements in four or even 6−10 directions compared with conventional CSAMT. Therefore, it is more suitable for obtaining accurate characteristics of 2D and 3D electrical structures under complex geological conditions. Based on the above tests, the technical parameters of the tensor CSAMT applied in the Jima copper polymetallic deposit were determined as follows. The transmitting and receiving instruments utilized in this study include the 150 kW transmitter SuperTX-150 and the multi-function V8 receiver with a frequency range of 0.375−1920 Hz produced by Canadian company Phoenix Geophysical. Two mutually perpendicular and overlapped field sources were employed, showing a cross shape. The AB electrodes were set at a distance of 3 km and an elevation of 3800−3900 m, with a maximum elevation difference of 131 m. The survey lines were set at an elevation of 4600−5300 m. The connecting wires between the transmitter and four electrodes have roughly the same length. In terms of receiving ends, tensor observation was adopted. That is, five EM field components were measured, namely Ex, Ey, Hx, Hy, and Hz. Meanwhile, each V8 receiver controls two 3ERs. The main operating parameters were set as follows: AB electrode spacing: 3 km, resistivity of AB electrodes: 13 Ω and 16 Ω, respectively, transmitter-receiver distance: 23−27 km, transmitting current: 60−65 A, MN electrode spacing: 25−50 m, and observation duration: 1 h.",

First, the equipment setup includes using a SuperTX-150 transmitter system capable of 150 kW power output, along with a V8 multifunctional geophysical workstation from Canadian Phoenix Geophysics as the receiver. The transmitter is configured to emit frequencies ranging from 0.375 to 1920 Hz using a cross-shaped overlapping field source, with electrodes placed at an AB distance of 3 km apart and at altitudes between 3800 to 3900 meters. The receiver measures five field components (Ex, Ey, Hx, Hy, Hz) using the tensor observation method, and the system is controlled through a 'one-to-two' setup, meaning one V8 control unit manages two 3ER receivers. Measurement conditions include an observation time of one hour, a transmission current of 60 to 65 A, and electrode resistances of 13Ω and 16Ω for the AB electrodes. The data collection also considers geographic factors like the elevation of measurement lines between 4600 to 5300 meters and a maximum altitude difference of 131 meters between transmitter electrodes.",
