            "description": "The rock stones in the Zuoduoshan Mountain are heavily weathered and piles of inverted talus are scattered throughout. This dataset is a composite product of visible light photographs for the typical talus in Zuoduoshan Mountain collected by aerial survey from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on 25th – 26th, August 2020. The dataset contains one visible orthophoto and one digital surface model (DSM). The geographic location of the survey area is 101°48'32.58\" - 101°52'36.84\" E, 30°02'51.03\" - 30°06 '32.74\" N, with a survey area of 22.6 square kilometres. This survey mission was carried out with the FeiMa UAV D200s equipped with the SONY ILCE-6000 visible camera, using ground-based single base station post processed kinematic (PPK) technology to acquire the spatial position (pos) and related parameters corresponding to each image capturing moment. The images are processed by FeiMa UAV Manager and Pix4d aerial survey software to synthesize the orthophoto of the survey area and generate a high precision DSM at the same time, with a spatial resolution of 10 cm. This product can be used as basic information for research related to the talus in this region, and are also worthy to provide a reliable verification reference for the products obtained from satellite remote sensing technology.",
            "instructions": "Files: The dataset were compressed using 500 MB split-volume compression of the original files, yielding a total of 12 compressed files (*.rar), including 4 DSM (UAV_DSM.part01.rar - UAV_DSM.part04.rar) and 8 orthophoto data (UAV_Orth.part01.rar - UAV_ Orth.part08.rar).\nUsage: Put the downloaded complete package into a same file place and unzip it to get the original files UAV_DSM.tif and UAV_Orth.tif. UAV_DSM.tif, the surface elevation model (DSM) data of the survey area; UAV_Orth.tif, the orthophoto data of the survey area; both have a spatial resolution of 10 cm and are in GeoTIFF format. These two products can be opened and viewed by ArcGIS, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ENVI and other software and processed accordingly. The data are with WGS1984 geographic coordinates, and can be set the projection coordinates with different projection methods.",
