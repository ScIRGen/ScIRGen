It was fetched by the cutting ring and was measured through oven drying.\n     Land cover types included spruce forest located in different elevation levels of 2600m, 2700m, 2900m, 3100m and 3300m, scrub of 3300m, 3400m and 3500m, and tailo grassland of 2600m, 2700m, 2800m and 2900m.\n     Data were archived in Excel format.",
