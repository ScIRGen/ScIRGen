            "description": "This data is the U-Pb chronology and trace element data of zircon. The samples were collected from the Tugeman beryllium lithium mining area, Altyn Tagh. In the middle of the middle section of 15-4, the rock type is tourmaline albite quartz pegmatite, sample No. 18barj02-5. Zircon selection was completed in the laboratory of Hebei Institute of regional geology and mineral resources; Zircon cathodoluminescence imaging and zircon U-Pb isotope dating analysis were completed in Wuhan Samplesolution Analysis Technology Co., Ltd. Zircon UPB isotopes were analyzed by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The data confidence is 95%, and the data reliability is high. The sample zircon is the zircon that was crystallized or recrystallized by magmatic zircon in the hydrothermal stage of pegmatite, which can restrict the formation of Tugeman beryllium lithium granite pegmatite in the post-collision stage of the collision process between Azhong block and Qaidam block after the closure of the southern Altun ocean in the late Middle Ordovician (460Ma).",
