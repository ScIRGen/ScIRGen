            "description": "Surface solar irradiance (SSI) is one of the products of FY-4A L2 quantitative inversion. It covers a full disk without projection, with a spatial resolution of 4km and a temporal resolution of 15min (there are 40 observation times in the whole day since 20180921, except for the observation of each hour, there is one observation every 3hr before and after the hour）, and the spectral range is 0.2µ m～5.0 µ m. The output elements of the product include total irradiance, direct irradiance on horizontal plane and scattered irradiance, the effective measurement ranges between  0-1500 w / m2. The qualitative improvement of FY-4A SSI products in coverage, spatial resolution, time continuity, output elements and other aspects makes it possible to further carry out its fine application in solar energy, agriculture, ecology, transportation and other professional meteorological services. The current research results show that the overall correlation of  FY-4A  SSI product in China is more than 0.75 compared with ground-based observation, which can be used for solar energy resource assessment in China.",

                "Solar radiation is the main energy source on Earth, and accurate measurement of ground solar radiation is an important foundation for fields such as meteorology, agriculture, construction, and solar power generation. For a long time, the number of national-level ground radiation observation stations in China has remained around 100. To obtain a higher resolution of spatial distribution, researchers often estimate ground solar radiation using other ground-observed meteorological elements (such as sunshine hours, temperature, etc.) or utilize satellite remote sensing data to inversely derive various radiation elements using statistical or physical methods. Fengyun meteorological satellite data has been widely applied in weather, climate, ecology, and environmental fields. In 2014, it passed rigorous testing and evaluation by ECMWF, marking that the data quality of some instruments on Fengyun meteorological satellites has reached or approached international advanced levels. The first optical meteorological satellite of the Fengyun-4 series (FY-4A) was successfully launched on December 11, 2016, equipped with advanced instruments such as the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI), Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), Lightning Imaging Sensor (GLI), and Space Environment Monitoring Instrument Package (SEP), making it one of the most advanced next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites in the world. Ground solar incident radiation is one of the FY-4A Level 2 quantitative inversion products, including total radiation, direct radiation on a horizontal surface, and scattered radiation, with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of up to 15 minutes."

This results in lower monthly total radiation exposure in winter and higher in summer. The aforementioned characteristics of FY-4A surface solar radiation are primarily derived from its inversion algorithm or parameter settings, thus exhibiting universality."

Based on the minute-by-minute total radiation data observed at these three stations, the applicability of the FY 4A surface solar radiation incident product is analyzed. To compare and analyze the applicability of the FY 4A total irradiance, this article uses the coordinates of the three ground radiation observation stations as a reference to match the nearest pixel points from the FY 4A disk image. It extracts the instantaneous total irradiance at hourly intervals for the entire year of 2018 from these three pixel points, with data sourced from the National Satellite Meteorological Center."

A horizontal comparison among the three stations of Datong, Taiyuan, and Houma reveals that Datong station has the highest annual total radiation exposure, with the smallest relative error for FY 4A, while Houma station has the lowest annual total radiation exposure, with the largest relative error for FY 4A."
