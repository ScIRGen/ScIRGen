                "The Dahutang deposit is a newly discovered giant W-Cu-Mo deposit, which is located in the central part of the Jiangnan Orogen, South China. It is well accepted that this deposit is related with the magmatism in Yanshanian movement. During this period, there are widely distributed granites in South China. Ye et al. (2016) believed that the rock and ore-forming processes at Dahutang deposit are under a geodynamic setting of lithospheric thinning and extension based on the U–Pb Geochronology. This process is consistent with the large-scale tungsten ‑ tin polymetallic mineralization in the Qinhang metallogenic belt (~2000 km length, 70 – 30 km in width), South China. Fluid intrusion and oxygen fugacity are widely accepted as two important factors to affect the final mineralization in Dahutang according to the geochemical analysis. Combined with previous geochronological studies on magmatism and mineralization, the recent study showed that the multiphase magmatism and continuous accumulation of mineralization for a long period of time (151 – 130 Ma) have contributed to the formation of the giant Dahutang deposit. The Dahutang deposit is located in the central part of Jiangnan orogen, which is believed to result from the collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks during the Neoproterozoic period. Later on, this region reactivated at the Mesozoic due to the Paleo-pacific subduction. The granites outcrop in this region could be divided into two main periods, the Neoproterozoic granite and Yanshanian granite. The sedimentary rocks at Dahutang deposit include Neoproterozoic Shuangqiaoshan Group with metamorphosed turbiditic sandstone interbeds. The Neoproterozoic Jiuling biotite granodiorite is covered by Quaternary sediment and outcrop only in South Dahutang deposit."

In order to reveal the deep structure and better understand the mineralization in Dahutang region, we deployed a dense array cutting across the deposit. The possible mechanism for the formation of the Dahutang deposit is proposed based on previous frameworks and our new result."

                "However, the deep structure of Dahutang deposit is still unknown, and the reason for such a rare 20 m.y. long-lived multiphase magmatism and successive mineralization is puzzled. There are several large scale geophysical investigations in South China, including active seismic profile, ambient noise tomography, receiver function, density inversion from gravity and seismic constraints, and joint inversion of receiver function and gravity anomaly, but they have low resolution at Dahutang district. Even Yao et al. (2013b) performed the gravity explosion on the distribution of intrusive rocks at shallow depth; there are no geophysical observations with special attention on the deep structure beneath Dahutang deposit."

We deployed a linear dense seismic array in Oct 2018, with the trend oriented in NW-SE direction that cut across the main geological units. The P wave receiver function and short period group dispersion were measured based on this data. We follow the common data procedure developed by Bensen et al. (2007) to calculate cross-correlations. Fast Marching Surface Tomography (FMST) is applied to invert the mixed path Rayleigh wave group velocity. CPS330 program gives a linear algorithm to do the S-wave velocity inversion. P wave receiver-function image and H –κ stacking technique provide insightful tools to analyze discontinuities."

We finally got the data from 47 stations, and the average duration of the seismic stations is 14 days. The long period dispersion data comes from an ambient noise tomography of China, which involves more than 2000 stations and the resolution of group velocity in South China is 50 km."

These features may indicate the process of mineralization: under the context of lithospheric extension and thinning in the Late Mesozoic, there are some magma underplating and melting the lower crust. The hot melts migrated upward and differentiated, the dense component cooled in the middle-lower crust to form the high velocity zones. The light component intruded into the Neoproterozoic granite and formed the Mesozoic granite, providing the heat and material source for the further enrichment of tungsten ‑ copper polymetallic ore."
