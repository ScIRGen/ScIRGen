            "description": "The dataset of photosynthesis was observed by LI-6400XT Portable Photosynthesis System in the natural oasis eco-hydrology experimental area of the Heihe River Basin. Observation items included the main vegetation type in the lower reaches of Heihe river: Populus forest, which located in the Populus forest station and the mixed forest station of Ejinaqi. Observation periods lasted from 2014-07-24 to 2014-07-31. This dataset included the raw observation data of the Populus forest observed by LI-6400 during the observation periods.\n1）\tObjectives of observation\nThe photosynthetic datasets can be used in the study of plant physiological ecology characteristic and the simulation and validation for the eco-hydrological models.\n2）\tInstrument and theory of the observation\nMeasuring instrument: LI-6400XT Portable Photosynthesis System.\nMeasuring theory: Using the infrared gas analyzer to measure the change of CO2 concentration, and then measuring the differences of CO2 concentration between the sample chamber and the referenced chamber so as to acquire the net productivity of the leaf.\n3）\tTime and site of observation\nObservation site in the Populus forest station.\nObservation time: 2014-07-24\nObservation site in the mixed forest station.\nObservation time: From  2014-07-25 to 2014-07-31.\n4）\tData processing\nThe raw data of LI-6400 were archived in text format and can be opened by text editor or excel, the preprocessed data were in Excel format. Every time period of observation was archived in a single document, named as “date + type”.",
