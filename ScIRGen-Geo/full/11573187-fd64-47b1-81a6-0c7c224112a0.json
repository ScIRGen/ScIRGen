        "Accurate and high-resolution spatial soil information is crucial for efficient and sustainable land use, management, and conservation. Since the establishment of digital soil mapping (DSM) and the GlobalSoilMap working group, significant advances have been made in spatial soil information globally. Soil plays a pivotal role in earth's systems, facilitating the cycling of water, energy, and carbon across varying temporal and spatial scales. Its significance lies in regulating ecosystems by providing vital nutrients to living organisms, storing and cycling water, heat, carbon, and essential nutrients, and serving as a medium for vegetation growth and structural support. Soil data are essential for land surface models (LSMs), which form a part of Earth system models (ESMs). The diverse range of soil properties and their precise representation are crucial for robust land surface modeling, influencing various environmental, agricultural, and ecological assessments. In recent years, the national and global maps of soil properties have gained significant traction in research, with a surge of studies focusing on mapping one or more soil properties at high resolutions such as 90 meters spanning various countries.",
        "Despite its significant contributions to regional land surface modeling and geoscientific research, over time, several issues and shortcomings have been identified. The emergence of digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques (Mcbratney et al., 2003), particularly the success of machine learning in large-scale spatial prediction (Hengl et al., 2017; Poggio et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020), presents a methodological advancement for this study. Recent studies indicate that advanced machine learning models often outperform simpler ones, with the size of the sample also emerging as a crucial factor influencing model performance (Padarian et al., 2020). For China, mapping datasets encompassing one or multiple soil properties have already been developed. Given the complexity and diversity of China's geographical and climatic conditions, the study of soil properties mapping across this vast nation is of paramount importance.",
        "The tree-based model developed using QRF algorithm follows the RF methodology. However, unlike RF, where only the mean of the observations within each node is retained, the QRF approach preserves the values of all observations within each node. This comprehensive set of observations in each node is utilized to derive the quantiles, which are subsequently used to construct prediction intervals. These intervals serve as a measure of the prediction uncertainty, providing a more detailed understanding of the conditional distribution of the target variable. Additionally, the uncertainty estimates evaluated by QRF are likely more accurate and interpretable than those derived from regression kriging, particularly in areas with sparse samples (Liu et al., 2022a). Furthermore, QRF is capable of handling complex non-linear relationships and multivariate interactions, offering high predictive power (Gyamerah et al., 2020). This distinguishing advantage sets QRF apart from other machine learning algorithms (Liu et al., 2022b)."

        "To address this challenge, we utilized 11,209 representative multi-source legacy soil profiles (including the Second National Soil Survey of China, World Soil Information Service, First National Soil Survey of China, and regional databases) and high-resolution soil-forming environment characterization. The findings make important contributions to the GlobalSoilMap project and can also be used for regional Earth system modeling and land surface modeling to better represent the role of soil in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in China.",
        "This paper aims to develop a new version of CSDL (CSDLv2), with comprehensive soil physical properties, chemical properties for China at a 90 m resolution. This work builds on its previous version (hereafter referred as CSDLv1, Shangguan et al., 2013), integrating advanced machine learning algorithms, multi-source soil profile samples, and various high-resolution environmental covariates related to soil formation.",
        "The national-scale high-resolution soil property maps developed in this study have significant potential for applications in land surface modeling and Earth system modeling. These models simulate interactions between the land surface, atmosphere, and biosphere, making accurate representation of soil properties essential for improving model performance and predictions. For instance, soil pH is crucial for nutrient solubility, while CEC indicates fertility and nutrient retention capacity in land surface modeling."

      "challenges": [
        "However, accurately predicting soil variation over large and complex areas with limited samples remains a challenge, especially for China, which has diverse soil landscapes. The wide range between the 5% lower and 95% upper prediction limits may indicate substantial room for improvement in current predictions.",
        "Despite its significant contributions to regional land surface modeling and geoscientific research, over time, several issues and shortcomings have been identified. The limitations stem from the absence of more comprehensive national grid maps for soil properties, such as Available phosphorous (AP), Available potassium (AK), Alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen (AN), porosity, and others, imposing constraints on applications that necessitate a broader spectrum of soil properties information.",
        "Mapping China, covers approximately 9.6 million km², at 90 m resolution requires more than 109 pixels for each soil property at each depth, posing a considerable challenge. Due to the extensive geographic coverage and high-resolution requirements in soil mapping for this study, predicting each soil property at a specific depth involves a substantial volume of data, with environmental covariates data reaching up to 470 GB. Faced with such extensive data processing demands, conventional single-machine resources often prove inadequate and challenging to cope with."

      "methods": [
        "Using advanced Quantile Regression Forest algorithms and a high-performance parallel computing strategy, we developed comprehensive maps of 23 soil physical, chemical and fertility properties at six standard depth layers from 0 to 2 meters in China with a 90 m spatial resolution (China dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling version 2, CSDLv2). Data-splitting and independent samples validation strategies were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted maps quality.",
        "The workflow of this study is shown in Fig. 1. Four main processes are involved in this framework: Incorporating in-situ values of multiple soil profiles and overlaying them with covariates to generate a regression matrix for modeling. Using cross-validation to obtain optimal modeling parameters. Fitting prediction models based on the regression matrix. Applying spatial prediction models using high-resolution covariates and comparing predictions with existing maps using data-splitting and independent samples validation.",
        "To address potential overfitting concerns, the values of max_features and min_samples_leaf were fine-tuned using a 10-fold cross-validation method. This approach involved randomly dividing the entire dataset into ten folds. One-tenth of these sub-datasets was utilized as the validation sample, while the remaining sub-datasets were applied for training the QRF model. Initially, we partitioned environmental covariates into distinct 1° × 1° blocks. Using the finalized model, a single core performed spatial predictions within each block. Leveraging multiple cores processing, we simultaneously handled multiple blocks, significantly accelerating spatial predictions. Upon acquiring the outcomes for every block, we utilized image mosaicking to seamlessly integrate these outputs, ultimately assembling the comprehensive map of various soil properties and depths across China. All the experiments are performed on a Linux server with Intel Core (TM) i9-10980XE, 3.00GHz× 64 CPU, 512 GB RAM (Random Access Memory) and two NVIDIA RTX A5000 graphics cards."

The relative importance of environmental covariates in predictions varied with soil properties and depth, indicating the complexity of interactions among multiple factors in the soil formation processes.",
