            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Alpine meadow and grassland ecosystem Superstation superstation eddy covariance system (EC) belonging to the Qinghai Lake basin integrated observatory network from September 3 in 2018 to December 31 in 2019. The site (98°35′41.62″E, 37°42′11.47″N) was located in the alpine meadow and alpine grassland ecosystem, near the SuGe Road in Tianjun County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3718m. The EC was installed at a height of 4.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3A &EC150) was about 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Data during December 18 to December 24, 2018 were missing due to the data collector failure.\nThe released data contained the following variables: DATE/TIME, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). The quality marks of sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and carbon flux are divided into three levels (quality marks 0 have good data quality, 1 have good data quality and 2 have poor data quality). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.",

                    "Answer": "An eddy covariance system is a scientific instrument used to measure and analyze the exchange of gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, and energy between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. It is utilized in high-altitude meadow regions by being set up at specific sites to collect data at a high frequency, such as 10Hz, to capture the dynamics of these exchanges over time. The system in question involves instruments like an ultrasonic anemometer and a CO2/H2O analyzer, and it processes data to account for various corrections and calibrations, resulting in averaged data outputs over 30-minute intervals.",

                    "Answer": "In eddy covariance flux measurements, data processing steps like coordinate rotation and frequency response correction are essential due to the need to accurately capture and evaluate the turbulent fluxes of momentum, heat, and gases. Coordinate rotation is used to align the measured wind components with the mean wind direction, reducing errors due to instrument tilt or misalignment. Frequency response correction addresses the limitations of the measurement system in capturing high-frequency turbulence, ensuring that all relevant flux contributions are accounted for. These steps are crucial for obtaining reliable estimates of fluxes such as sensible heat, latent heat, and carbon dioxide, especially in complex environments like high-altitude grasslands.",

                    "Answer": "Using Eddypro software to process high-frequency flux data can lead to improved data quality and accuracy through various steps such as outlier removal, delay time correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction, and density corrections. These processes help ensure that the 30-minute averaged data are representative and reliable, with quality checks based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics. This results in categorized quality indicators for sensible heat, latent heat, and carbon dioxide fluxes, helping to identify and exclude data with potential errors or low quality.",

This knowledge can help in assessing the impacts of climate change on these ecosystems and improving ecosystem management by providing detailed insights into the surface-atmosphere exchange processes.",

Quality evaluation of flux values involves testing atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). The 30-minute flux values output by Eddypro software are screened by removing data from instrument errors, excluding data 1 hour before and after precipitation, and discarding data with more than 10% missing in the original 10Hz data within each 30-minute period.",
