      "description": "The full-spectrum spectral measurements were conducted over 8 land cover types, including four vegetation types (i.e., forests (larch), shrubs, grasses and crops (maize)), two soil types (i.e., ordinary soil and frozen soil), snow, and cement road. Three spectrometer types were utilized to assemble the data records, namely the reflectance measurement from visible to shortwave infrared region (solar reflectance spectra), the emissivity measurement in the thermal infrared region (thermal emission spectra), and the microwave radiation measurement in the microwave region (microwave radiation). They were measured synchronously with ASD/SVC reflectance spectrometer, 102F/BOMAN emissivity meter, and microwave radiometers (RPG/JYRS). Associated with the spectra, the parameters describing the targets’ properties such as the object type, observed time, location, the solar and sensor geometry, satellite images as well as the observed instrument and contributions of units, were simultaneously recorded as the auxiliary information to describe the spectral measurement scene. The satellite pixel spectra (i.e., 10 m sentinel-OLI reflectance and 500 m MODIS reflectance) corresponding to the measured site was also extracted. This spectra library aids particularly the development of the modeling ，can also support further research on cross-spectrum domains underlying mechanisms, i.e. the physical radiative transfer processes, and the retrieval of surface biophysical and biochemical parameters. They can serve as a reference truth for satellite observations in validation. The full-spectrum spectra provide more useful information for characterizing the spectral endmembers of remote sensing models, thus support more accurate identification and classification of surface type.",

      "challenges": [
        "However, there are several limitations to the exiting libraries. First, they provide spectra in shortwave, infrared, or microwave domains separately. This discontinuity does not meet the requirements for developing a unified spectral-domain radiative transfer model and its associated applications. Second, they rarely measure (and release) anisotropic spectra across different spectral domains. Nevertheless, apparent anisotropy exists in the surface reflectivity in the VNIR-SWIR spectral domain (e.g., bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)), emissivity in the TIR spectral domain (e.g., directional bright temperature), and reflectivity or emissivity in the microwave spectral domains (e.g., directional microwave radiation). Ignoring the directionality of satellite observations may lead to large errors in the retrieval of remote sensing radiation and vegetation structure variables. Therefore, the multi-angular spectra are a pressing need to advance the estimation of surface energy budget and modeling of land surface processes. Third, there is a lack of multiscale spectra measurements (e.g., leaf and canopy spectra), which hinders the understanding of cross-scale physical radiative transfer and associated ecological processes. Hence, the collection of multiscale spectra is much needed to help improve the understanding of cross-scale radiative transfer processes from individual leaves to canopies and even ecosystems and promote the exploration of scaling effects on ecological processes (e.g., upscaling plant function traits). Furthermore, the temporal dynamic spectra for typical vegetation are insufficient. Given the fact that the vegetation dynamics are crucial for modeling land cover change and plant phenology as well as its feedback to climate change, vegetation spectra across different growth stages need to be further supplemented in order to improve the monitoring and modeling of land cover and land use change, and surface phenology in general."

        "AnswerEn": "Integrating continuous reflectance spectra time-series data with satellite observations provides a vital linkage between detailed ground measurements and broader satellite data. This integration allows for improved monitoring and modeling of land cover change, as it captures vegetation dynamics across growth stages, which are essential for understanding land cover changes, plant phenology, and feedback to climate change.",
        "AnswerCn": "将连续反射光谱时间序列数据与卫星观测相结合，为详细的地面测量与更广泛的卫星数据之间提供了重要的联系。这种整合可以改善对土地覆盖变化的监测和建模，因为它捕捉了不同生长阶段的植被动态，这对于理解土地覆盖变化、植物物候以及对气候变化的反馈至关重要。",
