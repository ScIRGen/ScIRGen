            "description": "The dataset of automatic meteorological observations was obtained at the Yingke oasis station from Nov. 5, 2007 to Oct. 31, 2009. The observation site is located in an irrigation farmland in Yingke (E100°24′37.2″/N38°51′25.7″, 1519.1m), Zhangye city, Gansu province. The experimental area, situated in the middle stream Heihe river basin and with windbreaks space of 500m from east to west and 300m from south to north, is an ideal choice for its flat and open terrain. \n     Observation items were multilayer (2m and 10m) of the wind speed and direction, air temperature and humidity, air pressure, precipitation, four components of radiation; the surface infrared temperature; the multilayer soil temperature (10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm), the soil moisture (10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm), and soil heat flux (5cm & 15cm). \n     The raw data were level0 and the data after basic processes were level1, in which ambiguous ones were marked; the data after strict quality control were defined as Level2.  The data files were named as follows: station+datalevel+AMS+datadate. Level2 or above were strongly recommended to domestic users. As for detailed information, please refer to Meteorological and Hydrological Flux Data Guide.",

Coupling or use of the General Circulation Model (GCM) output to drive the land surface model is an important source of forcing data for large-scale land surface models, however the spatial and temporal resolution can not meet the requirements of a regional scale land surface model and its coarse resolution ignored regional environmental impact assessment. Thus, a regional scale land surface model or land surface data assimilation system needs forcing data with a higher temporal-spatial resolution. Therefore, downscaling GCM output is necessary in order to prepare for a long series of high spatial and temporal resolution forcing data for regional scale or basin-scale land surface, hydrological and ecological simulation and assimilation. Downscaling is a method of obtaining high-resolution climate or climate change information from relatively coarse-resolution GCMs. Dynamic downscaling uses large scale climatic background information to establish higher resolution meteorological distribution fields by GCMs. Regional climate model is considered to be an effective dynamic downscaling method to derive high-resolution local climate information. The model’s physical meaning is clear, it is built on the nonlinear interaction between large scale and regional scale, and can distinguish local features characterized by local topography, vegetation cover and soil hydrological processes, and can be used anywhere independent of observation data with an improved description of local features."

The traditional point measurements can just provide a soil moisture distribution in a limited area. The hydrologic models can simulate the soil moisture variation in large spatial and temporal scales. However, the uncertainty in initial model state, model physical parameters, meteorological forcing variables and model equations brings much error in the soil moisture estimation. Many researchers suggested that the most promising approach for estimating soil moisture is the integration of remote sensing surface soil moisture data and a hydrologic model (Kostove and Jackson, 1993). Many researches have been carried out on optimizing a computational model through minimizing the difference between the observation and model simulation results by the re-parameterization (Jarlan et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2009) or re-initialization (Heathman et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2008) of the computational model separately. The re-parameterization approach can improve the model state variables by adjusting uncertain parameters. Since some parameters can hardly be obtained by field measurements, they are often estimated from the experiences or references, which brings much uncertainty to the model parameters. The re-initialization approach does not attribute the simulation errors to the uncertainties of the initial conditions, model parameters or model physical equations. It can adjust the state variables directly and it adopts the updated state variables as the initial field to re-initialize the model.

NDVI time series reveal different temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics according to variations in landscape types, which reveal a certain degree of intra- and inter-annual changes in vegetation. Time series NDVI derived from multiple satellite sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (A VHRR), VEGETATION on Satellite Probatoire d‘Observation de la Terre (SPOT/VGT), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have proven to be powerful tools in global change-related studies such as vegetation dynamics monitoring, climate change, land cover mapping and change detection, and various other fields. However, the coarse resolution of these sensors limits their use in studies of biophysical processes on heterogeneous land surfaces. For example, vegetation monitoring is reduced in fragmented landscapes, where most of the pixels are composed of a mixture of different surfaces such as agricultural fields, grassland, or patches of other vegetation as well as unvegetated areas, which are often smaller than moderate-resolution pixels. Moreover, the vegetation fraction cannot be accurately estimated from NDVI data because of the nonlinear relationship of NVDI with the vegetation fraction and the saturation effect of NDVI at high biomass. High spatial resolution data such as those from the High Resolution Visible (SPOT/HR V) sensor, the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM), and the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) can be used for land use and land cover mapping, ecosystem dynamics monitoring, water quality monitoring, and yield estimation. However, only a few images can be obtained every year in most regions of China because of the vagaries of weather conditions and other constraints. Therefore, the CCD is confronted with the same problem as TM/ETM, SPOT/HR V, and CBERS, that their temporal resolution is not sufficient for detecting rapid surface changes, especially in frequently clouded areas. This limits the usefulness of these devices in studying the rapidly evolving biophysical processes that occur during the growing season."

The seasonal difference of GPP and ecosystem respiration (Re) determines the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between the atmosphere and forest ecosystems and is important for understanding global carbon cycle climate change research. The eddy covariance (EC) technique is one of the best micrometeorological methods for the estimation of CO2, water, and energy exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing provides consistent and systematic land surface observations and has played an increasing role in characterizing vegetation structure and estimating GPP. The fundamental methodology of GPP estimation is based on Monteith’s equation: GPP ¼ LUE /C2 fAPAR /C2 PAR, where LUE is the light use efficiency, often in units of mol CO2 per mol photosynthetic photon flux density (mol CO2 mol−1 PPFD), and fAPAR represents the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

The mechanism of radar backscattering from soils is complicated and strongly influenced by surface roughness. Surface soil moisture (mv) is important in agronomic, hydrological, and meteorological processes at all spatial scales. It plays a key role in water stress detection and irrigation management, especially for arid and semi-arid regions. It is well known that space-borne microwave radiometers and scatterometers possess the advantage of high revisit capacity but deficient in coarse spatial resolution. On the contrary, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have the capability to provide finer spatial resolution, on the order of tens of meters, meeting most spatial requirements for watershed management and hydrological applications. Radar systems emit pulses and receive echoes backscattered from the illuminated areas. The intensity value of each pixel is proportional to the radar backscattering coefficient (σ0), which depends on several factors, including the instrument’s technical specifications (frequency and polarization), terrain, dielectric characteristics (εr; strongly related to the soil water content) and the geometrical structure (roughness) of the target surface. The IEM unites the KA and the SPM and was verified by laboratory measurements of bistatic scattering from surfaces with small, intermediate and large scale roughness. The advanced IEM (AIEM) improves the calculation accuracy of scattering coefficient by keeping the absolute phase term in Greens function which was neglected by IEM.

                    "Answer": "Observation techniques, even advanced ones, cannot provide representative areal averages of land surface heat fluxes that match the scale of model grids. This discrepancy arises because these techniques often rely on satellite observables of land surface conditions, which may not capture the complexity and heterogeneity of terrestrial environments at the desired spatial resolution.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial and temporal resolution of General Circulation Model outputs often fails to meet the requirements of regional scale land surface models. This coarse resolution can overlook regional environmental impacts, necessitating the use of downscaling methods to achieve the necessary high-resolution forcing data for accurate simulation and assimilation in regional or basin-scale models.",

                    "Answer": "Traditional point measurements of soil moisture provide limited spatial coverage, while hydrologic models, although capable of simulating variations over larger scales, suffer from uncertainties in initial states, parameters, and meteorological inputs. Integrating remote sensing data helps to reduce these uncertainties by providing broader spatial coverage and enhancing the model's ability to accurately estimate soil moisture through data assimilation techniques like the Ensemble Kalman Filter.",

                    "Answer": "Remote sensing data like ASTER and MODIS have demonstrated effectiveness in estimating land surface parameters, as these data sources provide crucial spatial and spectral information required for parameterizing models. The findings in the field illustrate that methodologies involving algorithms like SEBS can achieve acceptable accuracy in estimating turbulent heat fluxes even in areas with partial vegetation cover. MODIS, in particular, provides daily coverage with the necessary spectral characteristics, making it suitable for estimating parameters such as GPP.",

Addressing these challenges could involve employing data assimilation techniques like the Ensemble Kalman Filter and Genetic Algorithms, which can calibrate model parameters and initial states synthetically, thereby improving the accuracy of soil moisture estimation.",

The effectiveness of SAR data is demonstrated by the proposed two-step retrieval scheme based on AIEM, which shows feasibility in achieving reliable soil moisture estimates. However, challenges such as the impact of vegetation cover and the labor-intensive nature of field measurements for surface roughness remain key considerations.",

                    "Answer": "One of the key challenges is the presence of vegetation cover, which significantly impacts estimates of surface roughness and soil moisture. Field measuring surface roughness is very time-consuming and impractical at a regional scale. Inaccuracies may occur due to various deployments of instrumentation, sampling strategy, and the ambiguous scale effect during field campaigns and data post-processing. The use of advanced radar remote sensing techniques, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, offers a potential method for overcoming these challenges by providing finer spatial resolution data suitable for watershed management and hydrological applications.",

A one-dimensional soil moisture assimilation scheme based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be used. This approach calibrates model parameters and initial states synthetically. The assimilation experiment carried out in the Heihe River Basin showed that this method significantly improves the accuracy of soil moisture estimation by using ASAR data as observation inputs.",

High-resolution data from sensors like SPOT/HRV, Landsat TM/ETM, and CBERS can provide detailed information but are limited by temporal coverage due to weather conditions. A data assimilation method with continuous correction (CC) can be used to combine temporal information from MODIS with spatial information from high-resolution sensors like HJ-1 CCD to produce high temporal and spatial resolution NDVI data, enhancing utility for applications requiring detailed NDVI information.",
