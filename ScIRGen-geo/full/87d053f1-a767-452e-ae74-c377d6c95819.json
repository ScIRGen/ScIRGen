            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne imaging spectrometer (OMIS-II) mission was obtained in the Linze station foci experimental area on Jun. 15, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) soil moisture (0-5cm) measured by the cutting ring method (50cm^3) in  LY06 and LY07 strips (repeated nine times). The preprocessed soil volumetric moisture data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) surface radiative temperature measured by three handheld infrared thermometer (5# and 6# from Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, and one from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources, which were all calibrated) in the LY06 and LY07 strips (49 points and repeated three times), and Wulidun farmland quadrates (various points and repeated three times). Data were archived as Excel files.\n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",

It involves conducting measurements on the ground simultaneously with the passage of an imaging device overhead. In this specific case, it involves soil moisture and surface radiation temperature measurements conducted concurrently with the flight of the airborne imaging spectrometer OMIS-II to ensure the data can be accurately correlated and calibrated.",

                    "Answer": "For soil moisture observation, the target is the 0-5cm surface layer, measured using a ring knife with a volume of 50cm^3. Observations are conducted at specific sample plots with multiple sampling instances, and data are preprocessed into soil volumetric water content and stored in Excel. For surface radiation temperature observation, handheld infrared thermometers are used, which are calibrated against blackbody sources. Observations are made at multiple points within sample plots during aircraft overpasses, with data calibrated and stored in Excel.",

Challenges include maintaining the calibration accuracy over time and under varying environmental conditions, as well as the need for repeated calibrations to validate and adjust the instruments. In the provided field, calibration was performed by comparing the measured temperatures with blackbody temperatures, establishing a linear fit to adjust the raw observations. The data was processed to align with these calibrations, storing the refined data in Excel format.",
