This observation site can offer in situ calibration data for TASI, WiDAS and L band sensor used in aerospace experiment.\nObservation Site:\nThis point is located in a large and homogeneous adobe roof in Shiqiao Village, Xiaoman Town, Zhangye City. Land surface of observation site is relatively flat and uniform, and also not tall trees around. It’s about 20 meters away from southwest No.4 eddy covariance system (EC4) observation points. The coordinates of this site: 38°52′38.50″ N，100°21′27.00″ E。\nObservation Instrument:\nObservation system is composed of a SI-111 infrared radiometer (Campbell, USA) installed vertically downward, two CMP3 pyranometer (Kipp&Zonen, Netherlands) one upward, another downward. Observation height is 1.0 m, data logging by a Campbell CR850 logger. \nSensor orientation：\nObservation mounting arm has 3 m long, parallel to roof edge, azimuth angle: 156° (East by south 66°)\nObservation Time:\nThis site operates from 23 June, 2012 to 20 September, 2012. Observation data laagered by every 5 seconds uninterrupted. Output data contained sample data of every 5 seconds and mean data of 1 minute.\nAccessory data:\nLand surface (adobe roof) temperature, downward/upward total solar radiation, surface albedo.  Dataset is stored in *.dat file, which can be read by Microsoft excel or other text processing software (UltraEdit, et. al). Table heads meaning: Rs_downwell, downward shortwave radiation (W/m^2); Rs_upwell, upward (reflect) shortwave radiation (W/m^2); albedo, calculate by Rs_upwell/ Rs_downwell. SBT_C, body temperature of SI-111 sensor (℃); Target_C, Target of surface temperature (℃). Dataset is stored day by day, named as: data format + site name + interval time + date + time.

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
