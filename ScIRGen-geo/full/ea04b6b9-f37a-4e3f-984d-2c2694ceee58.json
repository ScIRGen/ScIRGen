            "description": "On 3 August 2012 (UTC+8), a Wide-angle Infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner (WIDAS) carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a visible near Infrared thermal Dual-mode airborne remote sensing experiment, which is located in the artificial oasis eco-hydrology experimental area (5×5 km). WIDAS includes an CCD cameras with spatial resolution 0.08 m, a visible near Infrared multispectral camera with five bands scanner (an maximum observation angle 48° and spatial resolution 0.4 m), and a thermal image camera with spatial resolution 2 m.\nThe CCD camera data production are recorded in DN values processed by mosaic and orthorectification. The mutispectral camera data production are recorded in reflectance processed by atmospheric and geometric correction. Thermal image camera data production are recorded in radiation brightness temperature processed by atmospheric and geometric correction.",

In the context of ecological hydrology research, such as the experiment conducted in the Heihe River Middle Reaches, this involves using aircraft equipped with sensors like WIDAS to capture visible/near-infrared and thermal infrared data at various angles. This approach allows for the collection of high-resolution data with different spectral and spatial resolutions, such as 0.08 meters for high-resolution CCD, 0.4 meters for multispectral, and 2 meters for thermal imagery, providing comprehensive information about the study area.",
