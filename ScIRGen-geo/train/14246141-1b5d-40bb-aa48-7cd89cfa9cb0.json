            "description": "Global warming and human activities have led to the degradation of permafrost and the collapse of permafrost, which have seriously affected the construction of permafrost projects and the ecological environment. Based on high-resolution satellite images, the permafrost of oboling in Heihe River Basin of Qinghai Tibet Plateau is taken as the research area, and the object-oriented classification technology of machine learning is used to extract the thermal collapse information in the research area. The results show that from 2009 to 2019, the number of thermal collapse increased from 12 to 16, and the total area increased from 14718.9 square meters to 28579.5 square meters, nearly twice. The combination of high spatial resolution remote sensing and object-oriented classification method has a broad application prospect in the monitoring of thermal thawing and collapse of frozen soil.",
