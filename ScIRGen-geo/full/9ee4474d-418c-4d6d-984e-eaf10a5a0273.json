            "description": "Through the excavation of Melondapu Cave site, Geting site and Jiangxigou site, the basic information of the cultural attributes and cultural relics of these Paleolithic-Epipaleolithic sites was obtained. The artifacts, animal and plant remains, soil samples during the excavation process were collected and analyzed, and a number of radiocarbon dating data, lithic artifacts data and environmental test data were obtained. This data set enriches the information of the Paleolithic sites of the Tibetan Plateau, provides an important basis for the construction of space-time framework and cultural sequence, and provides data support for the further study of prehistoric human activities and subsistance strategies in the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau.",
