            "description": "In this study, an algorithm that combines MODIS Terra and Aqua (500 m) and the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) (4 km) is presented to provide a daily cloud-free snow-cover product (500 m), namely Terra-Aqua-IMS (TAI). The overall accuracy of the new TAI is 92.3% as compared with ground stations in all-sky conditions; this value is significantly higher than the 63.1% of the blended MODIS Terra-Aqua product and the 54.6% and 49% of the original MODIS Terra and Aqua products, respectively. Without the IMS, the daily combination of MODIS Terra-Aqua over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) can only remove limited cloud contamination: 37.3% of the annual mean cloud coverage compared with the 46.6% (MODIS Terra) and 55.1% (MODIS Aqua). The resulting annual mean snow cover over the TP from the daily TAI data is 19.1%, which is similar to the 20.6% obtained from the 8-day MODIS Terra product (MOD10A2) but much larger than the 8.1% from the daily blended MODIS Terra-Aqua product due to the cloud blockage.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has a mean elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level, based on the area of the plateau above 2500 m (3 ×106 km2). The TP and surrounding regions have a glacial and perennial-snow area of ∼100 000 km2 comprising 46 000 glaciers. The TP is also known as Asia’s water tower because the melt-water from the glaciers and snow cover supplies Asia’s largest rivers, which sustain the domestic water supply for more than 1 billion people downstream. Snow plays an important role in the water budgets of high-mountain regions worldwide. Snow-covered area (SCA) is also one of the key variables affecting the Earth’s energy balance because of its high albedo. Snow cover has been mapped using many remote sensors in the visible, near-infrared, thermal, and microwave wavelengths. Optical remote sensing has achieved critically important data for observing the Earth’s snow cover. Since 1966, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has provided the earliest available SCA data of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). In addition, reliable hemispheric snow cover maps have been available since 1972 from NOAA’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. The low temporal resolution (16 days) of Landsat data hinders its wide application in snow monitoring. Available since 2000, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are superior to either Landsat, due to higher temporal resolution, or AVHRR, due to higher spatial resolution and data quality in mapping SCA. However, cloud blockage greatly limits the application of these optical snow cover products. Passive microwave sensors can penetrate cloud cover and provide cloud-free snow cover products. The Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) utilizes a variety of multi-sourced data sets, including visible imagery from geostationary satellites and polar orbiting satellites that include passive microwave sensors. However, the coarse spatial resolution of passive microwave snow products relative to moderate- and high-resolution MODIS and Landsat images is a disadvantage. Many studies have presented improved methodologies to reduce cloud obscuration and expose more snow cover pixels in the MODIS snow cover product."

The performance of TAI is evaluated with the station-based snow depth measurements. The TP is divided into 12 great basins to compare the performance of snow cover mapping from different products."

The low temporal resolution (16 days) of Landsat data hinders its wide application in snow monitoring. Cloud obscuration in MODIS Terra–Aqua is still a challenge. The IMS could overestimate SCA due to poor identification of fractal snow cover. The daily composite products could produce data gaps and errors due to the different viewing geometries of MODIS Terra/Aqua."

The composite rule is that the remaining cloud pixels (code 50) of Terra–Aqua images are replaced with IMS pixel values and then remapped to MODIS value codes.
