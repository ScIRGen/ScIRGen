The dataset used MODIS marine chlorophyll concentration data, diffuse attenuation coefficients, VIIRS water-leaving radiation data and ERA5 reanalysis meteorological data as input. Hourly emission fluxes of isoprene from two marine sources were calculated, including marine biological emissions and photochemical emissions in the sea microsurface, using the latest physical, biological and chemical processes and empirical relationships derived from recent obervations and laboratory studies. Data for Netcdf format file, containing biological emissions' flux_bio and photochemical emissions' flux_sml 'two variables as well as latitude and longitude information, with temporal resolution for hours. The dataset provides two spatial and temporal resolutions, including daily 1 degree grid and hourly 0.25 degree grid . The reliability of this dataset is verified by comparing the results of marine isoprene concentrations and emission fluxes from this dataset with those from previous observations. Isoprene, as an important biological volatile organic compound (BVOC), is a major source of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from natural sources in terrestrial and marine area. This dataset can be used as an input data for earth system model simulation in formation of marine SOA. This work in order to further study the effect of air-sea system for Marine SOA formation and its climate effect laid a solid foundation.",

                "Biogenic organic volatile compounds (BVOCs), one of the most important components in the marine boundary layer (MBL), play an important role in the formation of marine secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), particularly in pristine remote oceans. Among all the non-methane BVOC species, isoprene exhibits large emissions and demonstrates significant atmospheric chemical reactivity in the marine environment. Within the MBL, isoprene can undergo oxidation, leading to the formation of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and low-volatility organic compounds (LVOCs) such as methacrolein and methacrylic acid. Due to its significant emissions and capacity to contribute to SOA formation, marine isoprene plays a crucial role in aerosol generation and growth within the MBL. Previous studies have estimated marine isoprene emissions using both bottom–up and top–down approaches. The estimation of BIO emissions is typically derived from an empirical linear relationship established between ocean chlorophyll concentration and isoprene emissions. The estimation of SML emissions is based on the surfactants present in the SML and their associated photochemical processes. Previous estimates also encountered challenges related to data availability and unclear emission mechanisms, leading to uncertainties in the estimated emissions. Estimations for high latitudes are particularly lacking due to limited satellite data coverage during the winter months. Moreover, previous estimations of vertical distributions of chlorophyll and isoprene concentrations did not entirely align with current observed vertical profiles in the subsurface ocean."

This work provides the foundation for further studies into the impact of the air–sea system on marine SOA formation and its climate effect. Our dataset can be used as input data for climate or atmospheric chemistry models. The module can also be coupled with the earth system model to calculate marine isoprene emissions online."

Moreover, previous estimations of vertical distributions of chlorophyll and isoprene concentrations did not entirely align with current observed vertical profiles in the subsurface ocean. The relationships between emissions and marine and meteorological factors, established on the basis of localized phytoplankton populations, are regionally constrained and may not be applicable in all situations. These limitations led to discrepancies between observed emissions and the estimations obtained using previous methods."

These two datasets were averaged into grids with a resolution of 0.25°×0.25° to fit the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) dataset used in this study. Additionally, the monthly normalized water-leaving radiance at 410 nm for the period 2012–2020 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA CoastWatch, 2017) was utilized to determine the distribution of phytoplankton types together with chlorophyll concentration. The phytoplankton-generated emission module was developed based on the assumption that the concentration of isoprene in the ocean remains static in each hour. The isoprene production rate, P, was determined by a linear relationship between chlorophyll concentration, radiation, and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, as well as the classification of phytoplankton types. The aforementioned equations were utilized to estimate the hourly marine isoprene emissions originating from phytoplankton within each grid, with a spatial resolution of 0.25°×0.25°. The dominant phytoplankton type was determined using monthly satellite-observed normalized water-leaving radiance at 410 nm and seawater chlorophyll concentration. An interpolation for hourly isoprene BIO and SML emissions is applied during the boreal summer (June, July, and August) and winter months (December, November, and January) in this study."
