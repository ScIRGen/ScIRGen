(2) The main ways to obtain data are through camera field photography and re drawing based on previous research. (3) The image quality is a high-resolution original size image. (4) The prospect of image application is that it can be used for further in-depth research and comparison.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection through camera field photography refers to the technique of using cameras to capture high-resolution images of fossils and related field sites. This method allows researchers to document the physical attributes and context of paleontological findings, providing a visual dataset that can be used for further analysis and comparison in studies.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods using high-resolution camera field photography provide original, high-quality images that capture detailed features directly from the fossil site, offering an accurate representation of the fossils as they are found. In contrast, methods based on re-drawing from previous studies rely on the interpretation and artistic skill of researchers, which might introduce some level of bias or inaccuracy, but can also incorporate insights from prior knowledge and systematic revisions.",
