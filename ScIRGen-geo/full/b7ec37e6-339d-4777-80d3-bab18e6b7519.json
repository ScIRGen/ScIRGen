            "description": "The land use / land cover data set of Heihe River Basin in 2011 is the Remote Sensing Research Office of Institute of cold and drought of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the remote sensing data of landsatm and ETM in 2011, combined with field investigation and verification, a 1:100000 land use / land cover image and vector database of Heihe River Basin is established. The main contents include: 1:100000 land use graph data and attribute data of Heihe River Basin.            The land cover data of 1:100000 (2011) in Heihe River Basin and the previous land cover are classified into six first-class categories (cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, urban and rural residents, industrial and mining land and unused land) and 25 second-class categories by the same hierarchical land cover classification system. The data type is vector polygon and stored in shape format.\n\nThis data respects the opinion of the data author, and cannot share the whole basin data temporarily. Please indicate the research scope and exact purpose on the data application.",

The water from the Heihe River is important to agricultural production and ecosystem stabilization in the middle and lower reaches of the HRB and is highly sensitive to climate change and human activities in the area. Human activities have therefore become the dominant driver of changes in the water resources of the HRB over the last 60 years. With large-scale developments in the use of both water and land resources, human-induced water shortages have become a serious environmental, economic and social problem. To prevent further ecosystem deterioration and to restore the environment in the lower reaches, the Chinese Government implemented the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP) in 2000."

                "A substantial increase in the farmland inevitably led to the over-extraction of groundwater and a transfer of water from ecosystems. The over-extraction of groundwater has resulted in declining groundwater levels in particular areas of the middle reaches. The declining groundwater levels and the reduction in ecological water led to the reduction of shrub forests and an increase in grassland desertification in particular areas of the middle reaches. In the field survey, we found that a large area of Elaeagnus forest exhibited drought stress or partial die-out in the tree farms of Jiulong Jiang. This effect was probably due to declining groundwater levels and ecological water. The expansion of farmland areas in the middle reaches will present a severe challenge for local governments when continuous low-flow years occur. This trend may also threaten the sustainability of the entire river basin."

From 2000 to 2011, the farmland area increased by 12.01%. The farmland expansion increased the water resource stress; thus, groundwater was over-extracted and the ecosystem was degraded in particular areas. Both consequences are negative and potentially threaten the sustainability of the middle reaches of the HRB and the entire river basin."
