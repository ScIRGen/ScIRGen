            "description": "The basic data of hydrometeorology, land use and DEM were collected through the National Meteorological Information Center, the hydrological Yearbook, the China Statistical Yearbook and the Institute of geographical science and resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The distributed time-varying gain hydrological model (DTVGM) with independent intellectual property rights is adopted for modeling, and the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is divided into 10937 sub basins with a threshold of 100 square kilometers. The daily flow data of 14 flow stations in Heihe River, Yarlung Zangbo River, Yangtze River source, Yellow River source, Yalong River, Minjiang River and Lancang River Basin were selected to draft and verify the model. The daily scale Naxi efficiency coefficient is above 0.7 and the correlation coefficient is above 0.8. The actual evaporation simulation is basically consistent with the station observation published by the Meteorological Bureau. The model simulates the water cycle process from 1998 to 2017. After verification, the spatial and temporal distribution of the actual evaporation (including soil evaporation and plant transpiration) on the 0.01 degree daily scale in the whole Tibetan Plateau is given.",

                "Hydrological science is a branch of the earth sciences. To study the complexities of hydrological processes and the associated environmental problems, a systematic approach is desired. In addition to the linear systematic approach, many hydrologists have been exploring nonlinear ways for presenting hydrological systems since the 1960s. This is due to the fact that the hydrological processes are generally too complicated to be expressed as linear systems, due mainly to the heterogeneousness of the relationships and interactions between hydrological processes and spatial characteristics. The nonlinearity is not only a fundamental science problem revealing complexities of earth system, but also a field for pioneering advanced hydrological theories and applied research. The nonlinearity involves many concepts and conflicts, such as deterministic vs. stochastic, order vs. disorder, simple vs. complex, quantitative vs. qualitative, partial vs. integrated. At present, although the general theory of nonlinear hydrology has not been completely established, the related research has been in progress."
