This approach is used to reduce uncertainty and variability by considering the average outcome from a set of different initial conditions or model configurations. In the field mentioned, only ensemble mean files are provided for the Task3 experiments, highlighting their importance in representing the collective behavior of the modeled climate system over the specified time range.",

In the CNRM Data LS4P Task3 experiments, two different land temperature masks were applied to investigate how variations in initial land conditions could affect the climate model outcomes over a two-month period.",
