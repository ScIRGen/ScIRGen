The data set is mainly prepared for disaster and risk assessment. Due to the huge coverage, the geomorphic data adopts 150m spatial resolution and other data adopts 1000m spatial resolution. Geomorphology, vegetation index, temperature and rainfall data are mainly produced by processing open source data, and disaster bearing value grade data are produced by superposition calculation, comprehensively considering population data, night light index, buildings and surface cover types.",

        "Spatially interpolated gridded climate data, here referred to as 'climate surfaces', are used in many areas of work, particularly in the environmental, agricultural and biological sciences. For many applications, data at a high (≤1km2) spatial resolution are preferred to capture environmental variation that can be lost at lower spatial resolutions, particularly in mountainous and other areas with steep climate gradients. Hijmans et al. (2005) provided climate surfaces, referred to as the ‘WorldClim version 1 database’, for global land areas (excluding Antarctica), consisting of long-term average monthly temperature and precipitation. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of climate stations for which data is available, including a number of stations located at high latitudes and elevations. Furthermore, while the original dataset was limited to monthly precipitation and temperature, we also included solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure, which may be necessary to model important processes such as plant growth. Estimates for regions where weather station density (or quality) is insufficient to resolve local gradients may be improved using remotely sensed meteorological data from satellites."

We compiled monthly average climate data for weather stations from a large number of global, regional, national, and local sources, mostly for the 1970–2000 period. Utilizing satellite-derived data and other covariables, we interpolated these data using the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in ANUSPLIN and created global climate surfaces for monthly precipitation and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure. Final surfaces were created by selecting only the model with the lowest cross-validation RMSE value for each region, fit to the full dataset."

        "The digital data archive of nighttime lights was first established at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in 1992. Studies focusing on the application of nighttime lights have flourished since the publication of annual stable lights based upon DMSP-OLS by the NOAA Earth Observation Group (EOG). In the last few years, the EOG has processed and published nighttime lights from the VIIRS, which flown on the satellite launched in 2011. Some new features of VIIRS lights data include monthly updates, higher resolution, and better overall quality. Testing the applicability of new VIIRS lights in estimating economic statistics provides an important initial step. It is well known that economic development significantly influences and is highly correlated with inequality, poverty, public health, migration, urbanization, and a wide range of social phenomenon. The inquiry of the GDP-light association started when DMSP-OLS lights first became available. In the last decade, over a thousand publications have used DMSP-OLS lights to predict economic activities. These studies were important because, unlike conventional economic statistics provided by governments or international organizations, which are often inconsistent in timeframe, definition, and measurement instrument employed, nighttime lights have the advantage of being objectively measured, updated regularly, and cover the entire globe (except for at high latitudes). Additionally, lights data avoid systematic errors due to government misreporting or differences in methods, and this may make them a more reliable source in predicting true GDP values at the global, national, and local levels. The availability of DMSP-OLS annual stable lights from 1992 to 2013 allows researchers to investigate the GDP-lights relationship with cross-sectional and time series data during 1990s and 2010s. In general, the results suggest the DMSP-OLS lights are useful for cross-sectional analysis, but it may not provide enough information to predict time series economic statistics."

The GDP data by state and MSA are downloaded from the official website of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. For VIIRS lights, we use annual data for the corresponding time periods, i.e. annual average lights for 2014–2016. To generate consistent measure of annual VIIRS lights, we use averaged monthly composites as an annual light measure for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The digital values of VIIRS lights are aggregated at the state and metropolitan levels and then merged with real GDP by the administrative unit.

        "QuestionCn": "您如何评估覆盖大地理区域（如青藏高原）数据集的发展，特别是在空间分辨率和数据集成方面？",
        "AnswerEn": "The development of datasets covering large geographic areas, such as the Tibetan Plateau, involves careful consideration of spatial resolution and data integration. The use of 150m spatial resolution for geomorphological data and 1000m for other data types reflects a balance between data granularity and the vast coverage area. Data integration involves processing open-source data for geomorphology, vegetation indices, and climate, while the disaster-bearing capacity data involves overlay calculations, considering population, nighttime lights, buildings, and land cover types.",
        "AnswerCn": "涵盖大面积地理区域的数据集开发，如青藏高原，涉及对空间分辨率和数据集成的仔细考虑。使用150米的空间分辨率用于地貌数据，而其他数据类型则使用1000米，反映了数据细节与广泛覆盖区域之间的平衡。数据集成涉及处理开放源数据，包括地貌、植被指数和气候，而灾害承载能力数据则涉及叠加计算，考虑人口、夜间灯光、建筑物和土地覆盖类型。",

        "AnswerEn": "In mountainous regions, high spatial resolution (≤1km2) is preferred to capture environmental variations that can be lost at lower resolutions. This is particularly important for areas with steep climate gradients, such as rain-shadows or abrupt temperature changes due to ocean-land transitions.",
        "AnswerCn": "在山区，高空间分辨率（≤1km²）被优先考虑，以捕捉可能在较低分辨率下丢失的环境变化。这对于具有陡峭气候梯度的地区尤为重要，例如雨影区或由于海洋-陆地过渡引起的突变温度变化。",

        "AnswerEn": "Satellite-derived data are used in interpolation to improve estimates for areas with low station density and unusual gradients, such as inversions. These data can include variables like maximum and minimum land surface temperature and cloud cover, which help refine climate surface estimates where ground-based data alone may be insufficient.",
        "AnswerCn": "卫星衍生数据用于插值，以改善低站点密度和异常梯度区域（如逆温现象）的估计。这些数据可以包括最大和最小地表温度以及云覆盖等变量，帮助在仅靠地面数据不足的情况下，精确气候表面估计。",

        "AnswerEn": "Nighttime lights data are considered reliable because they are objectively measured, updated regularly, and cover the entire globe. They avoid systematic errors due to government misreporting or methodological differences, providing a more consistent basis for predicting GDP values at various geographic levels.",
        "AnswerCn": "夜间灯光数据被认为是可靠的，因为它们是客观测量的，定期更新，并覆盖全球。它们避免了由于政府误报或方法差异导致的系统性错误，为在不同地理层面预测GDP值提供了更一致的基础。",

        "AnswerEn": "Geomorphological and vegetation index data in large-scale disaster risk assessments are primarily collected by processing open-source datasets. The geomorphological data use a spatial resolution of 150m, while other data like the vegetation index are collected at a 1000m spatial resolution.

Prediction errors remain high in regions with low station density, unusual gradients, or sharp gradients such as rain-shadow areas or abrupt temperature changes due to ocean-land transitions.",
        "AnswerCn": "挑战包括卫星衍生的协变量仅在边际上改善气候表面估计，突显了需要一个密集的、高质量的气候站网络。在站点密度低、异常梯度或急剧梯度的地区（如雨影区或由于海洋-陆地过渡引起的温度急剧变化），预测误差仍然很高。",
