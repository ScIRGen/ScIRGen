Sri Lanka is located in the core node of the \"maritime Silk Road\", which is the necessary node of our oil transportation lifeline. The wave observation data of this sea area is of great significance to understand the wave characteristics of this sea area and ensure the navigation safety of cargo ships and sea convoys. The data is obtained by the pressure sensor deployed on the seabed, and the data reliability is ensured by the quality control segments such as the removal of abnormal values. This data is of great significance to the analysis of marine disaster assessment, ship passing safety assessment and the study of wave characteristics in the sea area.",

                "Ocean observational data are difficult to obtain but are needed for model validation and data assimilation. Specifically, wind and wave observational data are of great importance for the study of ocean surface mixing, local air–sea interactions, coastal hydrodynamic characteristics, sediment movement, monsoon studies, and ocean engineering. Matara is the southernmost city of the Indian Peninsula and is bordered by the northern Indian Ocean. The northern Indian Ocean is an important area for studying swells in the global wave climate, which persistently form in the southern oceans owing to the absence of land barriers (Alves, 2006). Many wind and wave observations have been made in the Bay of Bengal (Glejin et al., 2013a; Nayak et al., 2013) and Arabian Sea (Aboobacker et al., 2011a; Glejin et al., 2013b); however, investigations of wind and waves in the waters south of Sri Lanka, which hosts one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, are scarce. Although datasets from reanalysis projects (Semedo et al., 2010) and models (Sabique et al., 2012; Bhaskaran et al., 2014; Murty et al., 2014) are increasingly common, in situ observations (Rapizo et al., 2015) remain the most important reflections of the “true” ocean and atmosphere state. Therefore, most major developments in the marine and atmospheric sciences have been closely related to the development of in situ observations."

This dataset advances our understanding of the nearshore hydrodynamic processes and wave climate, including sea waves and swells, in the north Indian Ocean. Moreover, it is a valuable resource for ocean model parameterization and validation."

                "In these waters, simultaneous records of wind and wave data are sparse due to difficulties in deploying measurement instruments, although the area hosts one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. There are significant errors in the measurements, especially for MWD. These could be caused by the complicated nearshore geometry and/or by the resolution of the large-scale ERA-Interim model, which is so low that it cannot describe changes in complex seabed terrain."

                "The wind and wave dataset for Matara, Sri Lanka, consists of data obtained mainly from two different observation systems: the AWS and wave buoys. After rigorous quality control, the time series of wind, air pressure, and surface waves from the AWS, Buoy 1, and Buoy 2 were used to generate datasets with temporal resolutions of 30 min, 10 min, and 1 h, respectively. The main technical processes involved in generating the dataset are as follows: 1. calibration of all sensors, 2. transfer of a data in real time to a storage facility (to reduce or remove manual intervention), 3. error detection, 4. deviation testing and removal of records that deviate by > 3 standard deviations from the data mean. The data collected in southern Sri Lanka were taken from an integrated observation system that included the wave buoys (Buoy 1 and Buoy 2) and the AWSs (AWS1 and AWS2). Buoy 1, which was anchored at the bottom of the sea at a depth of 20 m in September 2013, was operated normally and continuously to collect water level and wave data for about 5 months. Buoy 2, which measured both wave and water level for 1 year from April 2013 to April 2014, consists of two instruments, a self-contained wave buoy at a depth of 10 m and a water level gauge. The seaside AWS (AWS1) was installed in December 2012 and can measure meteorological parameters, including wind speed and direction, air temperature, air humidity, and air pressure at an elevation of 12 m. In December 2015, the AWS was upgraded and moved approximately 5 m, with all sensors installed at an elevation of 1.5 m (AWS2)."

                "Based on Buoy 2 data, the swells are the main component of waves year-round, although monsoons can markedly alter the proportion between swell and wind sea. The comparison of the reanalysis and measured Hs data shows a general mean correlation (correlation coefficient =0.747) with a general mean RMSE of 0.435 m during both years. Annually, 66.1 % of the waves are dominated by swells. Even though swells are predominant year-round, wind seas contribute sufficiently to the resultant waves during the SW (35.18 %) and NE (36.7 %) monsoon seasons. Waves from the south accounted for 69.12 % of all waves annually, mainly driven by swells, which predominate throughout the year. As a result, the wave climate in this area is controlled mainly by long swells."
