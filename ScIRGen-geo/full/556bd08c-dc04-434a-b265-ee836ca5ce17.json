            "description": "This dataset contains the glacier outlines in Qilian Mountain Area in 2021. The dataset was produced based on classical band ratio criterion and manual editing. Chinese GF series images collected in 2021 were used as basic data for glacier extraction. Sentinel-2 images, Google images and Map World images were employed as reference data for manual adjusting. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates, glacier ID and glacier area. Consisting of 1 season, the dataset has a spatial resolution of 2 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±2 meter). The dataset directly reflects the glacier distribution within the Qilian Mountain in 2021, and can be used for quantitative estimation of glacier mass balance and the quantitative assessment of glacier change’s impact on basin runoff.",

This method enhances the contrast between glaciers and their surroundings, making it easier to distinguish glacier boundaries. It is often combined with manual corrections to improve the accuracy of the extracted glacier boundaries.",

                    "Answer": "Using a combination of high-resolution satellite imagery, such as 2021 high-resolution images of the Qilian Mountain range, and manual correction methods can enhance the precision of glacier boundary mapping. This approach ensures spatial resolution around 2 meters and boundary accuracy within approximately one pixel, or 2 meters.
