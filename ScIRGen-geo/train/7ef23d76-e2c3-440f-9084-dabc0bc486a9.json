Additionally, the parameters set for the model, such as initial conditions, boundary conditions, and the representation of physical processes, can impact the accuracy and reliability of the ensemble daily mean data, as can the integration of multi-member ensemble simulations, which help account for variability and uncertainties in climate projections.",
