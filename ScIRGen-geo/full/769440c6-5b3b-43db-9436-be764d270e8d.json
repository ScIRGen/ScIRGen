This data is based on the five SSP scenario storylines. On the basis of considering the national fertility policy and the population ceiling policy of super cities, it estimates the information of population factors such as population size, age, sex and education level of 31 provinces in China from 2010 to 2100 under the SSPs scenario year by year, and establishes a 1km spatial resolution grid population dataset, which makes up for the vacancy of China's provinces and grid data, To meet the research needs of high spatial resolution.",

The provincial projection takes into account fertility promoting policies and population ceiling restrictions of megacities that have been implemented in China in recent years to reduce systematic biases in current studies. The predicted provincial population is allocated to spatially explicit population grids for each year at 30 arc-seconds resolution based on representative concentration pathway (RCP) urban grids and historical population grids. These data have numerous potential uses and can serve as inputs in climate policy research with requirements for precise administrative or spatial population data in China."

In addition, we downscaled the projected provincial population and established spatially explicit population grids for China with a resolution of 1 km from 2010 to 2100 under SSPs to meet the requirements of integrated assessment models."
