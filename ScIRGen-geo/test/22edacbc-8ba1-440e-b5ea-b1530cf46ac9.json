            "description": "To understand the potential impact of projected climate changes on the vulnerable agriculture in Central Asia (CA) in the future, six agroclimatic indicators are calculated based on the 9km-resolution dynamical downscaled results of three different global climate models and a high-resolution projection dataset of agroclimatic indicators over CA is produced. These indicators are growing season length (GSL, days), biologically effective degree days (BEDD, ℃), frost days (FD, days), summer days (SU, days), warm spell duration index (WSDI, days), and tropical nights (TR, days). The periods are 1986-2005 and 2031-2050. The spatial resolution is 0.1°. As all the indicators except WSDI are defined with absolute temperature thresholds and particularly sensitive to the systematics biases in the model data, the quantile mapping (QM) method is applied to correct the simulated temperature. Results show the QM method largely reduces the biases in all the indicators. GSL, SU, WSDI, and TR will significantly increase over CA and FD will decrease. However, changes in BEDD are spatially heterogeneous, with the increases in northern CA and the mountainous areas and decreases in the southern and middle part of the plain areas. This dataset can be applied for assessing the future risks in the local agriculture for climate changes and will be beneficial to adaption and mitigation actions for food security in this region.",

                "Central Asia (referred to as CA, Fig. 1), which consists of five countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), is highly agrarian, with 60% of its population living in rural areas and agriculture accounting for over 45% of total employment and nearly 25% of the Gross Domestic Production (Babu and Djalalov, 2006). Semi-arid to arid climates prevail in the lowland areas of CA. Thus, in the central and western parts of CA, agriculture is only possible with irrigation. As one of the hot spots of climate change (Giorgi, 2006), CA has experienced a significant warming (0.16°C (10 yr)−1) during the past century (1901–2003, Chen et al., 2009), with an accelerating warming rate (0.36°C–0.42°C per decade) in the past ~30 years (1979–2011, Hu et al., 2014). Meanwhile, its annual precipitation has increased (Chen et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2017). Climate change may pose challenges to the vulnerable agriculture in CA. Due to the lack of high-resolution climate data and less attention from the community relative to its surrounding areas, like East Asia, South Asia, and the Mediterranean (Wang et al., 2009; Piao et al., 2010; Iglesias et al., 2011; Bandara and Cai, 2014; Cramer et al., 2018; Aryal et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020), studies on the impacts of climate change on agriculture in CA are lacking, especially on the potential impacts of projected climate change under warming scenarios in the near-term future."

In this study, the model data from the downscaled results is applied to calculate some key agroclimatic indicators (referred to as AIs), which are proxies for the effect of weather and climate on specific agricultural activities (Arnell and Freeman, 2021) and both practical and understandable to farmers and policy makers (Trnka et al., 2011).

In particular, projected changes in the Cor-AIs over main producing areas of wheat and cotton are assessed.
