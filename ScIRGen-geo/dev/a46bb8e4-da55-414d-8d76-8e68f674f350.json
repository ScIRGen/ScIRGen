            "description": "The dataset is the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) products from 1980s to 2019 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the SAVI equation which is added soil adjusted parameters S based on NDVI equation.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.SAVI is stable in the sparse vegetation area, but is not sensitive in the dense vegetation area .",
            "instructions": "1) File name rules: the SAVI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the SAVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SAVI;the SAVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\". 2) How to use the dataset:the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "The Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) is a modification of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that minimizes soil brightness influences on vegetation index values. It is calculated by introducing a soil adjustment factor into the NDVI formula. SAVI is particularly useful in areas with sparse vegetation, as it provides more stable assessments of vegetation cover by accounting for soil background reflectance.",

                    "Answer": "The calculation method for SAVI data incorporates a soil adjustment factor, which makes it more stable in sparsely vegetated areas compared to traditional NDVI data collection methods. In contrast, NDVI can be less sensitive in areas with dense vegetation coverage, whereas SAVI remains less sensitive in such regions, highlighting a key difference in sensitivity between the two approaches.",

                    "Answer": "The incorporation of soil adjustment factors, as seen with the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), is designed to enhance the accuracy of vegetation measurement in areas with sparse vegetation. This approach helps reduce the influence of soil brightness, making the index more reliable in such regions. However, it is noted that in regions with dense vegetation, the index may become less sensitive, indicating a potential limitation in its applicability where vegetation cover is high.",

                    "Answer": "The stability of the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) in sparsely vegetated areas is attributed to the inclusion of the soil adjustment factor (S) in its calculation, which helps to minimize soil brightness influences. However, in densely vegetated regions, the index becomes less sensitive, posing challenges in accurately capturing vegetation dynamics.",
