            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Daman Superstation in the hydrometeorological observation network of Heihe River Basin between 15 September, 2012, and 31 December, 2013. There were two types of LASs at Daman Superstation: German BLS450 (labeled as NQ and AR) and Netherlands Kipp&zonen. The north tower was set up with the Kipp&zonen/BLS450_AR receiver and the BLS450_NQ transmitter, and the south tower was equipped with the Kipp&zonen/BLS450_AR transmitter and the BLS450_NQ receiver. BLS450_NQ has been in use since 26 September, 2012, Kipp&zonen has been in use since 23 September, 2013, and the observation period of BLS450_AR was from 15 September, 2012, to 25 July, 2013. The site (north: 100.379° E, 38.861° N; south: 100.369° E, 38.847° N) was located in Daman irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The underlying surfaces between the two towers were corn, orchard, and greenhouse. The elevation is 1556 m. The effective height of the LASs was 22.45 m, and the path length was 1854 m. The data were sampled at 5 Hz and 1 Hz intervals for BLS450 and Kipp&zonen, respectively, then averaged to 1 minute.\nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 exceeded the saturated criterion (BLS450: Cn2>1.43E-13, Kipp&zonen: Cn2>1.54E-13). (2) The data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS450: Average X Intensity<1000; Kipp&zonen: Demod>-20mv). (3) The data were rejected when collected during precipitation. (4) The data were rejected if collected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). In the iteration process, the universal functions of Thiermann and Grassl, 1992 and Andreas, 1988 were selected for BLS450 and Kipp&zonen, respectively.\nSeveral instructions were included with the released data. (1) The data were primarily obtained from BLS450_NQ measurements, and missing flux measurements from the BLS450_NQ instrument were substituted with measurements from the BLS450_AR and Kipp&zonen instrument. The missing data were denoted by -6999. Due to the problems of BLS450_NQ SPU storing and wireless transmission, large amount of data from 11 August to 17 August, 18 August to 20 August, 22 August to 24 August, 27 August to 30 August, 2013, and 1 September to 3 September, 19 September to 23 September, 2013, were not collected. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: data/time (yyyy-m-d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H_LAS, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xls format. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red. \nFor more information, please refer to Li et al. (2013) (for hydrometeorological observation network or sites information), Liu et al.

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
