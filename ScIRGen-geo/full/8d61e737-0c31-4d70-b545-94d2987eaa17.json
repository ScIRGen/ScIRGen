            "description": "1) Data content: Glacier elevation change in the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau in the past two decades, including time series during 2000 and 2020 and glacier elevation change from 2000 to 2019 at 0.5° grid scale.\n2) Data sources and processing methods: Time series during 2000 and 2020 were generated from glacier monitoring methods integrating satellite altimetry (ICESat, CryOSat-2, ICESAT-2), topographic data (DEM derived from ASTER L1A images in 2014), and satellite gravity (GRACE and GLDAS). The grid-scale glacier elevation changes were calculated by ICESAT-2 and NASADEM.\n3) Description of data quality: This data is consistent with UAV derived DSM results, GPS observations, and reported results. The temporal resolution and spatial resolution of this data have been significantly improved.\n4) Data application results and prospects: This data can be used to calibrate glacial / hydrological model. The data can also be compared with future studies.",
