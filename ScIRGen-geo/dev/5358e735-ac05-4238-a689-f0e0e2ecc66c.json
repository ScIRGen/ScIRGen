            "description": "The data comes from the 4th China Urban Rural Elderly Population Survey, which used multi-level and stratified sampling methods to survey 224142 representative elderly people aged 60 and above nationwide. We used the data from the 4th China Urban Rural Elderly Population Survey to study the situation of CCVD among the elderly. We used univariate and multivariate logistic proportional regression analysis to explore risk factors, and then incorporated them into a multivariate linear regression model to identify independent predictors of CCVD. Evaluate disease management based on the self reported diagnosis, treatment, and medical history of participants with CCVD. Result: After excluding samples with missing data, 215041 participants were included in the analysis. The overall incidence of CCVD is 26%. Living in rural areas, being elderly, female, with low education, smoking, lack of sleep, widowhood, living alone, lack of exercise, poor economic status, and not participating in public welfare projects are the main risk factors for CCVD among elderly people in China (P<0.05). In a multifactor linear regression model, keeping other factors unchanged, the occurrence of CCVD is still related to 'urban and rural'（ β= 0.012, P<0.001), \"Age\"（ β=- 0.003, P<0.001), \"Gender\"（ β=- 0.022, P<0.001), \"Education level\"（ β=- 0.017, P<0.001), \"Marital status\"（ β= 0.004, P=0.047), \"Smoking\"（ β= 0.012, P=0.003), \"Drinking\"（ β=- 0.015, P=0.001) and \"Sleep“（ β= 0.008, P=0.005). There is no collinearity issue among these factors. Conclusion: The main risk factors affecting the occurrence of CCVD among elderly people in China include rural residence, female gender, low education level, poor sleep treatment, bereavement, unmarried, living alone, lack of exercise, poor economic status, and lack of participation in social and public welfare projects. China urgently needs to improve national policies to prevent, control, and manage risk factors for CCVD in the elderly.",

                "An aging population is an essential national condition throughout China in the 21st century. By the end of 2014, the number of people aged 60 years or older in China had reached 212 million, accounting for 15.5% of the total population. According to the National Strategy Research Group of the Office of the China Working Commission on Aging, the number of older adults in China will peak at 487 million by 2053, accounting for 34.9% of the total population. This rapidly growing aging population will exert a long-term and profound impact on China’s economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological progress. Cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CCVD) is a common chronic vascular disease in the elderly. The death toll caused by CCVD accounts for about 40.27% of the total mortality in the country. According to current trends, by 2030, the prevalence of coronary heart disease in China will have increased by 3.7 times compared with 2000. According to the 2018 China Cardiovascular Disease Report, there are 290 million patients with CCVD in China, including 13 million with stroke and 11 million with coronary heart disease. The Stroke Screening Project showed that, in 2014, the prevalence of stroke among adults older than 40 years in China was 2.06%. Strokes can be divided into hemorrhagic strokes, caused by a sudden rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, and ischemic strokes, caused by a blockage of a blood vessel, which is opposed to each other. The subtypes of stroke are intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral ischemia. The mortality rate due to coronary heart disease was higher among men than women. Smoking dramatically increases people’s risk of other CCVD events. The incidence of CCVD increases with population changes. Age remains the most significant irreversible risk factor for CCVD. However, modifiable factors related to diet, lifestyle, physical activity, and psychosocial conditions also play a key role in the occurrence and development of CCVD. An analysis of 31,343 elderly individuals published in 2017 pointed out that old-age frailty is closely related to CCVD and constitutes a changeable risk factor for CCVD in the elderly. There is considerable evidence to suggest that aging is an actual new disease in the 21st century and that it plays a vital role in developing CCVD."

Furthermore, we researched risk factors for prevalent CCVD and documented the current management of CCVD among the Chinese elderly. The purpose of our study was to provide vital data necessary to decrease the prevalence rate of CCVD among the elderly in China. Chinese national policies for preventing, controlling, and managing risk factors for CCVD in the elderly must be urgently developed."

This method can lead to more reliable findings by reducing sampling bias and ensuring that diverse segments of the population are included. In the context of studying diseases among elderly populations, this approach helps capture the variability in risk factors and disease prevalence across different subgroups.",

However, limitations include the risk of recall bias, inaccuracies due to misunderstanding or misreporting, and the inability to verify the data against objective medical records. To enhance the utility of self-reported data, researchers can design questionnaires that are easy to understand, and where possible, corroborate self-reports with clinical data.",
