            "description": "Investigation of plant sample plots can reflect the structure and distribution of plant communities, the declining succession of plant communities and their interrelation with environmental changes, reveal the ecological damage process in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, and provide scientific basis for the environmental remediation of the Tarim River Basin in the large-scale development of the western part of the country.\nAccording to the difference of species composition of plant communities in different sections of 9 monitoring sections in the lower reaches of Tarim River, plant sample plots are set up along the direction perpendicular to the river course in each monitoring section.  Due to the different vegetation growth in each section, the size and number of sample plots are not equal.  Among them, the sample plot of 5m×5m is arranged on the section of the herbaceous community.  30m×30m sample plots are arranged on the section where vegetation grows sparsely or is basically free of herbaceous plants, and 4 15m× 15 m arbor and shrub sample plots are arranged at intervals of 15 m;  50m×50m sample plots are arranged on the section where arbor, shrub and grass vegetation all occupy a certain proportion.  In each plot of 50×50m, four plots of 25m×25m are set at 25m intervals to record the individual number, coverage, DBH, basal diameter, height and crown width of each tree (or shrub).  At the same time, 4 small sample plots of 5m×5m are set up in each sample plot to record the individual number, coverage, height and other indicators of each herbaceous plant, and GPS is used to locate and record the altitude and longitude and latitude of each sample plot.\nData content includes:\n1. word Document for Statistics of Plant Sample Land Survey Data from 2000, 2002 to 2007\n2. 2000 Inventory of Plant Sample Sites in Lower Reaches of Tarim River (Akdun, Yahopumahan, Yingsu, Abodah, Keldayi Section Vegetation Coverage, Canopy Density, Root Weight, etc.) excel Table\n3. excel Table of Plant Sample Plot Survey in Lower Reaches of Tarim River in August 2002 (Data on Individual Number, Crown Width, Plant Height, Density and Coverage of Plants in Akdun, Yingsu, Khaldayi, Arakan and Shidaoban Sections)\n4. 2003 Inventory of Plant Sample Sites in Lower Reaches of Tarim River (Data on Individual Number, Crown Width, Plant Height, Density and Base Diameter of Plants in Lower Reaches of Tahe River and Herbaceous Biomass in Akerdun Section) excel Table\n5.

By comparing these factors across different sections and years, researchers can identify patterns of succession and decline in plant communities, and understand how these changes correlate with environmental factors.

In sections where herbaceous communities are present, smaller plots of 5m×5m are used, while larger plots such as 30m×30m are used in areas with sparse vegetation or no herbaceous plants. In sections where trees, shrubs, and grasses are all present in significant proportions, 50m×50m plots are established. These variations ensure that the survey accurately reflects the plant community's structure and distribution, as well as its interaction with environmental changes.",

This approach can enhance understanding of plant community dynamics, such as decline succession and the relationship between vegetation types and environmental changes.

Plots are established perpendicular to the river channel, with size and number varying based on vegetation growth. For herbaceous communities, 5m×5m plots are used, while 30m×30m plots are suitable for scarce vegetation areas. In mixed vegetation areas, a 50m×50m plot is established with four 25m×25m subplots at 25m intervals to record tree and shrub data such as individual count, coverage, diameter, height, and crown width. Additionally, within each subplot, four 5m×5m subplots record herbaceous plant data like individual count, coverage, and height, using GPS for location and altitude. This setup provides data for understanding plant community dynamics and environmental impacts.",
