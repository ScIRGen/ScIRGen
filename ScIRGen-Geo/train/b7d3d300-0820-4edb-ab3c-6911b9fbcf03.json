            "description": "As the highest peak on the earth, Mt. Qomolangma provides an unparalleled platform to study glacier-atmosphere interaction. Although glacier surface energy balance (SEB) on Mt. Qomolangma was examined during warm season, relevant knowledge during cold season is still unknown, which prevents a complete understanding of all-season glacier SEB on it. Based on an in-situ observation from October 2007 to January 2008, this study presents a cold-season glacier SEB result at 6,523 m above sea level on Mt. Qomolangma and identifies its atmospheric control. Our results show that the observational period experienced strong winds and deficient clouds. Near-surface wind speeds usually exceeded 10 m s-1, resulting in a substantial sensible heat transport towards glacier and thus enhancing outgoing longwave radiation, which, under the combined effect of deficient clouds, eventually caused an increase in longwave radiative loss. The large solar zenith angle and relatively high albedo of the glacier surface led to a small absorption of solar irradiance, which, in combination with the strong longwave radiation loss, resulted in a semi-permanent surface radiative loss. Uncommon over the highly reflective glacier surface, clouds decreased the incident solar radiation more than increased the longwave radiation, demonstrating that the clouds’ shading effect surpassed its greenhouse effect. As a vital heat sink, the turbulent latent heat induced an average sublimation rate of 0.8 mm water equivalent per day. This study provides valuable insights into the atmospheric control on the cold-season glacier-atmosphere interaction at high altitudes on Mt. Qomolangma when meteorological variables are subject to the westerlies. ",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surroundings have the highest and largest mountain mass in the world, earning them the name of “the third pole.” Glaciers on TP contribute substantially to drinking water, irrigation for agriculture, and hydropower supply for about 800 million people downstream. Given the significance of the TP’s glaciers for the regional environment, efforts to monitor their change have increased over the past decades. These studies show that TP’s glaciers have experienced persistently increasing but spatially heterogeneous mass loss since the 1960s, with the highest mass wastage in the southeastern region of TP and greatest mass gain in Kun Lun. Glaciers are sensitive to climate change. To better understand the heterogeneous response of TP's glacier to climate change, glacier surface energy balance (SEB) must be well understood since it is an effective means to physically describe the relationship between the glacier and the overlying atmosphere. As the highest mountain on the earth, Mt. Qomolangma (Everest) is a unique site suitable for carrying out high-altitude glacier SEB research."

This study provides valuable insights into the atmospheric control on the cold-season glacier-atmosphere interaction at high altitudes on Mt. Qomolangma when meteorological variables are subject to the westerlies. To close this knowledge gap, a new AWS was installed at the same observational site as in 2005 on the East Rongbuk glacier in October 2007. Based on the 3.5 months of meteorological observation, this paper investigates the glacier SEB pattern at the 6,253 m asl in the cold season, aiming to provide valuable insights into the westerlies-controlled glacier-atmosphere interaction at high altitudes on Mt.

Continuous meteorological data were recorded from 3 October 2007 to 18 January 2008, during which all sensors worked well and the data integrity was excellent. These data were assembled into hourly means for glacier SEB calculations in this study. The glacier SEB model used in this study is very similar to that previously utilized by van den Broeke, Reijmer, and van de Wal. Using hourly AWS data as input, the model solves for the hourly surface temperature Ts for which the glacier SEB is closed.
