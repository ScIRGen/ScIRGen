Each SoilNET node observe the soil moisture and soil temperature at 4 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm depth using the SPADE sensor with 10 minutes interval. This dataset can be used in the estimation of surface hydrothermal variables and their validation, eco-hydrological research, irrigation management and so on.  \nThe detail description please refers to \"SoilNET_data_document.docx\".",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
