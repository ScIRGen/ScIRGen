            "description": "Provide detailed spatial distribution of population data in China from 1990 to 2015 year by year. The data is 1km grid data, with population pop as the indicator. The grid data comprehensively considers multiple factors for weight distribution to realize the spatialization of population, which is convenient for data sharing and spatial statistical analysis. The data comes from the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center of the Institute of Geographic Science and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The annual data is obtained by linear interpolation of the original data, and saved in geotiff file format. The methods and standards of data over the years are consistent, the coverage is complete, and the collection and processing process is traceable and reliable.",
            "instructions": "File name: the population data is stored in GeoTIFF format. The name of the file is \"popyyyy. TIFF\", where yyyy stands for year. For example, pop1990.tiff describes China's population distribution in 1990.\nData reading method: it can be opened with ArcGIS, R / Python and other programming languages. The data is 1km grid data and is based on the number of people.",
