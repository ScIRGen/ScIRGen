            "description": "The China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor is confronted with security problems related with global warming, mostly including the increasingly serious of degradation of permafrost and land desertification. On one hand, frozen soil degradation has caused frequent disasters such as debris flow, flood, ice and snow damage along the China-Mongolia-Russia transportation and pipeline, which will cause water and soil erosion followed by exposed pipes in frozen soil, in particular in summer. On the other hand, desertification will drive the ecological environment more vulnerable with the compound hazards of soil erosion and sandstorms occurring frequently. Therefore, this dataset will hopefully provide basic climate data for the research on the climate change and its impacts on permafrost and desertification for the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor. The original data is extracted from ERA5- Land surface climate reanalysis data (ERA5 – Land) (source: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu). We adopted the inverse distance weight (IDW) method to interpolate the original data with the spatial resolution of 10 km. Based on this dataset, the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of climatic factors are outlined over the past 40 years for the corridor.",

                "Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change. The advance or delay of the growing season reflects the long-term biological impacts of climate on the terrestrial ecosystem and, as a result, influences the productivity of the ecosystem. Temperature records, as well as model simulations, show that global temperatures have increased obviously and significantly, especially in mid and high latitudes since the beginning of the 20th century. Over the past several decades, both field observations and satellite records showed an extension of the growing season at regional and global scales. Remote sensing measurements are capable of providing continuous spatiotemporal information and have become the most commonly used tool to monitor the phenology variations at large scales in recent decades. The relationship between vegetation phenology and climate change has been widely documented on different temporal and spatial scales. Most studies have provided evidence that the warmer temperature unequivocally contributed to the progressive advance of the start date of the growing season (SOS) for various vegetation types over both temporal and boreal regions. In the forest ecosystem, the relationship between phenological variations and temperature has been well studied. Snow is different from rainfall as, in the high-latitude environments, thicker snowpack can insulate the soil from extremely cold temperatures and can help hold the soil nutrients, which is beneficial for forest growth."

However, little is known about the relative role of winter and spring snowpack and the possible lagged effects on the beginning or the end of the growing season in mid- and high-latitude forests. Though the changes in the end date of the growing season (EOS) also play a vital role in determining the length of the growing season, the variations in the EOS and its associated climatic driving mechanisms are still not fully identified in the forest ecosystem."

We used least square regression to detect the changing trend for the SOS and EOS from 1982 to 2015 at the pixel scale. We evaluated the response of spring and autumn phenology to monthly temperatures and SWE based on the partial least-squares (PLS) regression. We rescaled both the climate data and land cover data to 8 km using the bilinear spatial interpolation method to match the spatial resolution of the NDVI products."

The 300 m resolution global land cover data series from 1992 to 2015 produced by the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) were used to extract the forest distribution in our study area. Mean air temperature, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature and precipitation from the year 1982 to the year 2015 were obtained from Climate Research Unit (CRU) TS4.3 monthly data with a spatial resolution of 0.5°. The monthly SWE data in the same time period were obtained from GlobSnow SWE v2.0 data."

A higher April temperature is beneficial to the advance in the SOS, and a higher summer temperature has the potential to extend the EOS in the forest ecosystem. The preseason Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is also an essential factor in influencing the growing season. A higher SWE in February and March and lower SWE in April tend to advance the SOS, while higher SWE in pre-year December and lower SWE in current year October are beneficial to the extension of the EOS."
