            "description": "The global high-resolution simulated near sea surface temperature precipitation SST data set from 1990 to 2020 is from the latest cmip6 project. Cmip6 is the sixth climate model comparison program organized by the world climate research project (WCRP). Original data source: https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6 。 The data set includes the global near ocean surface temperature (TMP), precipitation (PR) and sea surface temperature (TOS). The air temperature and precipitation data include the rectangular combination of shared social economic path (SSP) and representative concentration path (RCP) of four different experimental scenarios of scenario MIP in cmip6. (1) Ssp126: upgrade rcp2.6 scenario based on ssp1 (low forcing scenario) (radiation forcing will reach 2.6w/m2 in 2100). (2) Ssp245: upgrade rcp4.5 scenario based on SSP2 (moderate forcing scenario) (radiation forcing will reach 4.5 w / m2 in 2100). (3) Ssp370: a new rcp7.0 emission path based on ssp3 (medium forcing scenario) (radiation forcing will reach 7.0 w / m2 in 2100). (4) Ssp585: upgrade rcp8.5 scenario based on ssp5 (high forcing scenario) (ssp585 is the only SSP scenario that can make radiation forcing reach 8.5 w / m2 in 2100). SST data provides ssp126 scenario data.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of climate modeling datasets, 'shared socioeconomic pathway' (SSP) refers to a scenario framework that describes different pathways of societal development and their implications on climate change. SSPs are used to model potential futures based on varying levels of socioeconomic challenges for mitigation and adaptation, combined with representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to assess climate impacts. For example, SSP126 represents a low-forcing scenario that builds on SSP1 with RCP2.6, indicating a scenario where radiative forcing reaches 2.6 W/m2 by 2100.",

                    "Answer": "The SSP126 scenario is based on SSP1, which represents a low forcing scenario, and is an upgrade of the RCP2.6 scenario, with a radiative forcing reaching 2.6 W/m2 by 2100. In contrast, the SSP585 scenario is based on SSP5, representing a high forcing scenario, and is an upgrade of the RCP8.5 scenario, with the radiative forcing reaching 8.5 W/m2 by 2100. These scenarios provide different pathways for socioeconomic development and emissions, impacting the modeling of future climate conditions.",

                    "Answer": "Different SSP and RCP combinations can result in varied data accuracy and model predictions due to differing assumptions about socioeconomic factors and radiative forcing levels. For instance, SSP126 represents a low forcing scenario, while SSP585 represents a high forcing scenario, affecting the projected near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and sea temperature data. These scenarios provide insights into potential climate outcomes, helping to assess the impacts of different climate policies and socioeconomic developments on future climate conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives behind collecting global high-resolution simulation data of near-surface oceanic air temperature, precipitation, and sea surface temperature from 1990 to 2020 are to facilitate comprehensive climate modeling and comparison through the CMIP6 initiative. This effort aims to understand the impacts of various shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) on climate projections, providing insights into potential future climate scenarios and aiding in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection utilizes a matrix combination of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) and representative concentration pathways (RCP) specific to each experimental scenario. These scenarios are based on updates to existing RCP scenarios under different SSPs, with each scenario representing different levels of radiative forcing by the year 2100: SSP126 with 2.6 W/m2, SSP245 with 4.5 W/m2, SSP370 with 7.0 W/m2, and SSP585 with 8.5 W/m2.
