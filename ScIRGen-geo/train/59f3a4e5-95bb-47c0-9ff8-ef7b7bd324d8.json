            "description": "Black carbon(BC) is a carbonaceous aerosol that mainly emitted from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels or biomass. As fine particles in the atmosphere with light-absorbing characteristic, BC can significantly reduce the surface albedo when deposits on snow and ice and accelerate the melting of glaciers and snow cover. New Aethalometer model AE-33 acquires the real-time BC concentration according to the light absorption and attenuation characteristics from the different wavelengths. In addition, AE-33 uses dual-spot measurements, which can compensate for the “spot loading effect” and obtain high-quality BC concentrations. By using the real-time observation data measured by AE-33 at Mt. Everest Station, we analyzed the seasonal and diurnal variations of BC and its sources and transport processes, and we also investigated the transport mechanisms of serious polluted episodes. That can provide basis for future works on assessment of climate effects caused by BC in this region.",

                "Black carbon (BC), resulting mainly from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels or biomass, has received much attention due to its influences on the environment and human health. In addition to greenhouse gases, it is seen as an important factor that may lead to global warming. BC can substantially absorb solar radiation and causes atmospheric heating. Moreover, BC can be suspended as fine particles in the atmosphere for approximately one week, transported far away from its emission sources, and then removed by dry and wet deposition. When BC is deposited on snow and ice, it can significantly reduce the surface albedo and accelerate the melting of glaciers and snow cover, impacting the regional climate, hydrology, and water resources. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), containing the region generally known as the “Third Pole”, is the highest plateau with a large number of glaciers and snow cover. Even though the TP is a remote region that is generally unaffected by anthropogenic activities, previous observations have indicated that BC is an important contributor to the rapid shrinking of glaciers over the TP due to its decreasing of the surface albedo and atmospheric warming. Moreover, previous studies have also suggested that the emissions from southern Asia and eastern Asia are the major sources of BC on the TP, and the high emissions from southern Asia can be transported across the Himalayas and farther onwards to the inland TP. Additionally, a large number of studies have demonstrated that the BC and dust from central Asia and northern Africa could also be transported to the TP."
