            "description": "This data is based on the ground temperature and permafrost stability in the 10km buffer zone along the Golmud Nagqu section of the Qinghai Tibet Highway. The data is sourced from Ran Youhua et al. (2020) using support vector regression models to simulate the annual average ground temperature of permafrost stability in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau region from 2005 to 2015. Five types of permafrost stability were classified based on the ground temperature gradient: extremely stable (<-5.0 ℃), stable (-3.0~-5.0 ℃), metastable (-1.5~-3.0 ℃), transitional (-0.5~-1.5 ℃), and unstable (>-0.5 ℃), A distribution map of permafrost stability in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau with a spatial resolution of 1km was generated. The annual average ground temperature data was interpolated to a resolution of 30m in ArcGIS software, and the frozen soil stability type was not processed. The range was cut through the 10km buffer zone boundary of the Qinghai Tibet high-grade highway.",
            "instructions": "The annual average ground temperature data and frozen soil stability data are stored in TIFF format and can be read using software such as ArcGIS and QGIS. For example, the file name is \"GN-MAGT\", where the first segment GN represents the Golmud-Nagqu section, GY represents the Gonghe-Yushu section, the second segment MAGT represents the annual average ground temperature, and Stabilitytype represents the stable type of permafrost over the years",

It is categorized into five types: extremely stable (<−5.0℃), stable (−3.0~−5.0℃), sub-stable (−1.5~−3.0℃), transitional (−0.5~−1.5℃), and unstable (>−0.5℃), using a spatial resolution map generated through support vector regression models.",

                    "Answer": "The categorization of permafrost stability types provides insights into the varying degrees of temperature and stability across different sections of the highway corridors, which can help infer environmental trends such as warming patterns and potential impacts on infrastructure stability. By analyzing these categories, researchers can identify areas that are more susceptible to temperature-induced changes, which may affect road stability and maintenance. It also highlights the need for targeted monitoring and adaptive strategies in areas identified as transitional or unstable to mitigate potential risks associated with permafrost thaw.",

                    "Answer": "The variability and accuracy of permafrost temperature and stability data collection along high-grade highways in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are influenced by the use of support vector regression models to simulate mean annual ground temperature data, the spatial resolution of data interpolation in ArcGIS, and the classification of permafrost stability into different categories based on temperature gradients. The data is also impacted by the geographical constraints of the 10km buffer zone along the highways.",

                    "Answer": "The simulation and classification of permafrost stability types can be achieved using support vector regression models, which allow for modeling permafrost stability over time by analyzing ground temperature data. These methods contribute to understanding permafrost temperature distributions along high-grade road buffer zones by providing spatially resolved data that classifies permafrost into categories such as extremely stable, stable, sub-stable, transitional, and unstable based on temperature gradients. This classification is crucial for generating detailed maps of permafrost stability with a spatial resolution of 1 km, further interpolated to 30 m using GIS software, aiding in the assessment of permafrost conditions along infrastructure corridors.",

These technologies facilitate the classification and mapping of permafrost stability types over large areas with high precision.",
