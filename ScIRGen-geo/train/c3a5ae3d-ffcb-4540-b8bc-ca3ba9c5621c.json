                "Tibetans have lived at high altitude (average 4000 m) for more than 30,000 years. They survive the low oxygen environment by a distinct suite of physiologic traits: decreasing arterial oxygen content, increasing resting ventilation, lack of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, lower incidence of reduced birth weight, and relatively low hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. In contrast, Han Chinese lowlanders moving to high altitude develop increased Hb concentration to compensate for hypoxia but usually leads to polycythemia that increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and fetal loss during pregnancy. This blunted response to hypoxia in Tibetans is the result of natural selection acting on genes in oxygen intake, delivery, and utilization. Previous genome-wide scans have identified many positively selected variants underlying high-altitude adaptation (Tibetan, Andean, and Ethiopian). In Tibetans, two major-effect genes (EPAS1/EGLN1) show the strongest signals of selective sweeps, which were significantly associated with a decreased hemoglobin phenotype. In addition, Tibetan-enriched EPAS1 variants were experimentally shown to down-regulate EPAS1’s transcription, providing molecular basis at the transcriptomic level of Tibetans’ blunted response to hypoxia."

            "challenges": [
                "However, major challenges remain to put those isolated data together and causally define genotype-phenotype relationships for high-altitude hypoxia adaptation. First, a great majority of these positively selected variants are located in non-coding regions which imply the critical role of gene regulation but challenges the elucidation of unknown cell type of action, relevant pathway, target gene, causality, and mechanism. In addition, these EPAS1 variants are highly linked and it is difficult to identify the causal variant(s) without context-specific multi-omics data. Second, hypoxia is a dynamic process and adaptation is a complicated phenotype involving many tissues. Functional variants are usually tissue-specific and may initiate the concerted effects of many regulatory elements and genes in a context-specific and time-dependent way. Third, accumulating evidence of existing studies suggests the polygenicity of hypoxia adaptation, i.e., high-altitude hypoxia adaptation is often affected by multiple genes/variants with small or moderate effects on transcription factors, regulatory elements and their target genes, and eventually trigger changes of a larger-scale regulatory network."
