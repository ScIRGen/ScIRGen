            "description": "In southern Tibet, Paleozoic strata are well developed and widely outcropped in the Himalaya area. The early stratigraphical divisions and palaeontological investigations of the Mt. Jolmo Lungma area were conducted by pioneer expedition teams in the 1920s, which originally assigned a Carboniferous or Permian age to the limestone from the Summit. The discovery of Ordovician strata in the region was mainly based on finding of index fossils from the Jiacun and other sections in the vicinity of Mt. Jolmo Lungma. However, detailed palaeontological research is still lacking for the Late Ordovician in study area. Our research focus on ostracods fauna from the Jiaqu Formation, which are described for the first time from the Upper Ordovician in Nyalam, southern Xizang (Tibet). Thirty species belonging to sixteen genera are described and figured from the Yalai Waterworks section. The ostracod fauna suggests a probable Sandbian-Katian age for the Jiaqu Formation. The ecological assemblage of ostracods fauna belongs to the Eifelian Ecotype, which implies deposition in an environment of nearshore when the Jiaqu Formation was being laid down. Many cosmopolitan or provincial genera were present in diversified ostracod fauna of the Jiaqu Formation, suggesting close biogeographic relationships among Himalaya terranes, Tarim and South China plates. This dataset includes the stratigraphic column of the Jiaqu Formation section and outcrop photos in the Himalaya area, southern Tibet.",
