            "description": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the sum of the reflectance values of the NIR band and the red band by the Difference ratio of the reflectance values of the NIR band and the red band. Vegetation index synthesis refers to the selection of the best representative of vegetation index within the appropriate synthesis cycle, and the synthesis of a vegetation index grid image with minimal influence on spatial resolution, atmospheric conditions, cloud conditions, observation geometry, and geometric accuracy and so on. This data set includes the monthly synthesis of 30m*30m surface vegetation index products in Qilian mountain area in 2021. Max value composition (MVC) method was used to synthesize monthly NDVI products on the surface using the reflectivity data of Landsat 8 and sentinel 2 channels from Red and NIR channels.",

                    "Answer": "The maximum value composition (MVC) method helps to minimize atmospheric and observational geometric influences by selecting the highest NDVI value within a given time frame, which is likely to be the least affected by clouds, atmospheric interference, and geometric distortions. By using the highest value, MVC ensures that only the clearest and most representative data are used for the monthly composite. However, challenges might arise from this approach due to potential biases introduced by consistently selecting the maximum value, which might not always accurately represent the average vegetation condition. Additionally, MVC might overlook subtle temporal changes in vegetation that are not captured by peak values, and there may be limitations in addressing areas with persistent cloud cover or other atmospheric disturbances.",

The Max Value Composition (MVC) method is used to achieve this by utilizing the reflectance data from the red and near-infrared bands of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. This method involves calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is the difference between the near-infrared and red band reflectance values divided by their sum, and selecting the maximum NDVI value for the composite image.",
