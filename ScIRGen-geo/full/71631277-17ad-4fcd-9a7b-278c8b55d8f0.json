            "description": "Recent studies indicate that the Asian Water Tower (AWT) is at risk due to climate change, which can negatively impact water and food security in Asia. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on lakes' spatial and temporal changes in this region. This information is crucial for understanding the risk magnitude and designing strategies. To fill this research gap, we analyzed 89,480 Landsat images from 1977 ± 2 to 2020 ± 2 to investigate the changes in the size of lakes recharged by the AWT. Our findings showed that out of the 209 lakes larger than 50 km2, 176 (84 %) grew during the wet season and 167 (81 %) during the dry season. 74 % of expanded lakes are located in the Inner Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Tarim basins. The lakes that shrank are found mainly in the Helmand, Indus, and Yangtze basins. Over the entire period, the area of shrinkage (55,077.028 km2 in wet season, 53,986.796 km2 in dry) markedly exceeded expansion (13,000.267 km2 in wet, 11,038.805 km2 in dry), with the drastic decline of the Aral Sea being a major contributor to shrinkage, accounting for 90 % of the total loss. From 1990 ± 2 to 2020 ± 2, alpine lakes mostly expanded, plain lakes mostly shrank, with the opposite trend from 1977 ± 2 to 1990 ± 2. Glacial loss and permafrost thawing under global warming in the Inner TP, Tarim Interior, Syr Darya, and Mekong basins were strongly correlated with lake expansion. However, permafrost discontinuities may prevent significant growth of lakes in the Indus and Ganges basins despite increased recharge. Our findings point to the prominence of the risk the lakes recharged by AWT face. Taking immediate action to manage these risks and adaptation is crucial as the AWT retreats and lake recharges are slowed.",

                "Recent studies indicate that the Asian Water Tower (AWT) is at risk due to climate change, which can negatively impact water and food security in Asia. In the Asia Water Tower (AWT) region, which provides water for almost 2 billion people, warming rates are twice the global average. Climate warming in AWT can cause substantial hydrologic and geomorphic alternations. The number of lakes larger than 1 km² on the Tibetan Plateau has increased from 1080 in 1976 to 1424 in 2018 in response to a significant global climate change, while the overall lake area expanded from 4.01 × 10⁴ km² to 5.03 × 10⁴ km². Most of the increases were found in endorheic basins, whereas exorheic basin lakes in the southern Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas showed a diminishing trend. These changes threaten downstream residents, who rely on meltwater and runoff for irrigation, hydropower, and urban freshwater consumption, as well as their infrastructures. Additionally, the expansion of AWT glacial lakes will raise the risk of flooding, particularly in the eastern Himalayas, which might nearly triple in the future. The impact of climate change on lakes is not uniform and varies from one geographic region to another. While some basins may experience increased streamflow and lake expansion, others may suffer from frequent low runoff and severe droughts that cause lake shrinkage. Most studies have been conducted from regional or geopolitical perspectives, and few have examined the AWT region as an integrated geographical region. Although existing literature reveals the changes in glacial lakes in the AWT region — due to global warming, both the number and area of glacial lakes are increasing, there is a lack of climatologically and geographically comprehensive studies on how non-glacial lakes located in basins recharged by the AWT respond to the warming climate."

This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis and dataset using 89,480 Landsat satellite images to quantify changes and identify trends in the lakes recharged by AWT over the past four decades. Our study provides the first holistic assessment of AWT recharge lakes, filling a research gap in this area. One of the keys to our study was mapping the updated boundaries of these lakes. These data provide a critical real-time perspective for effective water resource management."

Landsat images were sourced from the GEE, applying date and boundary filters. Cloudy pixels in the images were masked based on examining the internal cloud-algorithm-flag bits, followed by a mosaic creation through a median technique. To extract the water pixels, we derived two normalized indices: (1) Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and (2) Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). These polygon samples were then converted into 5000 random points, allocating 80 % for training and 20 % for testing. The validity of the results underwent assessment through various metrics: confusion matrix, overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and coefficient of determination (R²). For permafrost assessment, the CRDP v2 permafrost active layer thickness data spanning 2000 to 2019 was procured. These data were consolidated into a singular ‘.tif ’ file comprising 20 layers, with each layer signifying the image's corresponding year."

Landsat images were sourced from the GEE, applying date and boundary filters. ALOS DEM (Digital Elevation Model) satellite data at 30-m resolution collected by Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS) of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) was used to map the complex topography of the alpine mountain. We employed two datasets from HydroSHEDS, HydroBASINS and HydroLAKES.
