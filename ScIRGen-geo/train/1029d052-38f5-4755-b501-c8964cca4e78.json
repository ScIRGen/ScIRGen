            "description": "This data is the data of automatic weather station (AWS, Campbell company) set up at the top of the mountain in the west slope of Sejila by the comprehensive observation and research station of Southeast Tibet alpine environment of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016. The geographical coordinates are 29.5919 n, 94.6102 e, with an altitude of 4640 m, and the underlying surface is alpine grassland.\nThe data include daily arithmetic mean data of air temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), wind speed (M / s) and air pressure (MB) and daily accumulated value of precipitation. The original data is an average of 30 minutes before October 2018, and an average of 10 minutes after that. The temperature and humidity are measured by hmp155a temperature and humidity probe. The rainfall instrument model is rg3-m, the atmospheric pressure sensor probe is ptb210, and the wind speed sensor is 05103. These probes are 2 m above the ground. In terms of data quality: the obvious abnormal values are eliminated, the battery is damaged due to snow in the first half of 2019, and the data is missing. The missing temperature data is corrected by using the temperature fitting regression of 43900 m at nearby stations, and the data is yellow. Please pay attention when using it; the monitoring of precipitation starts from August 2019. The data station is a high altitude meteorological station in Southeast Tibet, which will be updated from time to time. It can be used by scientific researchers studying ecology, climate, hydrology, glaciers, etc.",

                "In mountainous areas, different altitudes exhibit distinct vertical zones due to variations in water (precipitation) and heat (temperature) components, forming typical mountain vertical belts. The Sejila Mountain in southeastern Tibet has obvious characteristics of mountain vertical belts: from the foot of the mountain to the summit, there are broadleaf forests, mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests, coniferous forests, shrubs, and moss. The vegetation types in Sejila Mountain are rich, and the longevity of trees is notable (Lu et al., 2015). The tree line at 4390 m is one of the highest forest tree lines in the world, making it a hotspot for tree-ring and forest ecology research (Wang et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018). Currently, there is limited research on the vertical gradients of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain (Liang et al., 2011). Most studies by some scholars on the changes in temperature and precipitation vertical gradients in this region and its vicinity are based on the Baji Station (formerly Linzhi Station) and the nearby Bomi Station, focusing on the vertical temperature lapse rate across the entire Tibetan Plateau (Jiang Jingchao et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2001, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) and precipitation gradients (Guo et al., 2016)."

This not only deepens the understanding of the influence of slope orientation on the vertical gradient changes of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain but also helps to better understand the physiological and ecological characteristics of plant and animal distribution with altitude changes. Additionally, it provides reliable data support for future hydrological modeling in this region."

Based on the geographical locations of these stations, the stations in the Sejila Mountain area are divided into two natural geographical units according to slope orientation: the west slope (south slope) and the east slope (north slope). The temperature vertical lapse rate and precipitation gradient are estimated, with the Sejila Mountain Pass station belonging to both the west and east slopes. The estimation of the temperature vertical lapse rate and precipitation gradient is obtained through regression analysis based on the elevation of the stations and the temperature or precipitation amounts."

                    "Answer": "The variation in precipitation gradients during different periods is caused by changes in altitude-related precipitation patterns. During the monsoon period, precipitation first increases, then decreases, and increases again with altitude, while in the non-monsoon period, it decreases first and then increases with altitude. These changes reflect the influence of monsoonal climatic conditions on precipitation distribution.",
