            "description": "An effective assessment of future climate change, especially future precipitation forecasting, is an important basis for the rational development of adaptive strategies for Northwest China, where the ecological environment is fragile and encompasses arid and semiarid regions. Based on RegCM 4.6 model and HadGEM2-ES scenarios with four different representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP 8.5), the climate projections of 0.25 degree in the future (2007-2099) at 3 hours, daily and yearly time scales over Northwest China are presented respectively. These data indicate that the near-surface temperature in Northwest China will continue to warm in the future under RCP 8.5 scenario. By the end of the 21st century, the temperature will become more significant. Over 6 °C, precipitation will continue to increase in the future, and will increase by 100 mm by the end of the 21st century; The number of extreme climate index summer days (SU) will continue to increase, indicating that high temperatures will be more frequent over Northwest China in future, meanwhile, the number of consecutive dry days (CDD) will decrease,",
