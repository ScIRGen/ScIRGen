            "description": "1) The data set includes fluid isotope data, homogenization temperature and salinity of inclusions, and in-situ LA-ICPMS composition data of the Rongna deposit, Tibet; 2) The data come from authoritative laboratories at home and abroad; 3) The data quality meets the standard; 4) Based on this data, the fluid evolution process of the Rongna superlarge porphyry-high sulfidation epithermal deposit in Tibet is reconstructed. Especially, the transformation process of fluid from porphyry to high sulfidation epithermal transition is described. It is found that the copper mineralization of the high sulfidation style in the deposit may be related to the dissolution and reprecipitation of copper minerals formed during porphyry stage. It is expected to provide support for the deepening of metallogenic theory and mineral exploration prediction of porphyry metallogenic system in the future.",
