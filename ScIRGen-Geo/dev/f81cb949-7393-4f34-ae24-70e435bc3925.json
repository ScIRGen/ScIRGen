            "description": "After three years of hard work, the cold region surface hydrology process study team of the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research completed the investigation, sampling and identification of vegetation in the Selincuo Lake Region. More than 200 plant type specimens were collected, and more than 2,000 high-definition pictures of plants were taken. At present, researchers have identified 45 species of plants belonging to 23 families and 35 genera. Plant classification experts from the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were invited to undertake secondary verification and correction of all plant species names that have been identified. The plant resources of the Selincuo Lake region have been matched with corresponding diagrams and annotations. It has been professionally typeset, edited and published as a reference to relevant academic research of the region.\nThe Selincuo Lake area is a semiarid grassland with trees and shrubs rarely distributed, and the herbaceous plants species are also relatively rare in the area. However, vegetation plays an indispensable role in maintaining the integrity of the local natural ecology, wildlife habitat and production and life of herdsmen. The investigation results showed that the plants in the lake area were abundant in families, but with few species and genera of the same family. Among them, Compositae has the most species, subordinate to seven genera and eight species, namely: one species of Leontopodium, two species of Artemisia, one species of Ajania, one species of Saussurea, one species of Heteropappus, one species of Taraxacum and one species of Anaphalis; followed by Boraginaceae with a total of 4 species, all of which are of the Microula; Ranunculaceae has three genera and three species, one species of Halerpestes, one species of Delphinium, and one species of Thalictrum; Scrophulariaceae has two genera and three species, one species of Lagotis, and two species of Pedicularis; Crassulaceae has three species, all of which are Sedum; Labiatae has two species, all of which are Dracocephalum; Cyperaceae has two species, one species of Kobresia, and one species of Carex; Polygonaceae has two species, all of which are Polgohum; Caryophyllaceae has two species, one species of Arenaria, and one species of Silene; Gramineae has two species, one species of Poa, and one species of Elymus L.; Liliaceae has two species, all of which are Allium; in addition, there are 12 species of plants with a single family and single genus, namely: Stellera of Thymelaeaceae, Urtica of Urticaceae, Gentiana of Gentianaceae, Morina of Dipsacaceae, Torularia of Cruciferae, Potentilla of Rosaceae, Myricaria of Tamaricaceae, Androsace of Primulaceae, Astragalus of Leguminosae, Oxytropis of Fabaceae, Chenopodium of Chenopodiaceae, and Incarvillea of Bignoniaceae.",

The region is characterized by sparse vegetation, with a variety of species but few genus and species per family. In contrast, densely vegetated regions may use more automated methods such as remote sensing to manage the larger volume and diversity of plant species and might rely less on exhaustive manual collection and identification due to the complexity of the ecosystem.",

This results in a complex ecosystem where maintaining ecological integrity and supporting local wildlife and human activities are crucial, yet difficult. Additionally, the presence of numerous plant families with a limited number of genera and species further complicates the identification and categorization processes.",
