                "Atmospheric aerosol is a general term for solid and liquid particles, with diameters ranging from 0.001 to 100 μm, suspended in the atmosphere, which plays an important role in terms of their interaction with the surrounding environment; for example, particle scattering directly affects clouds and radiative forcing and even indirectly influences climate change. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) is usually used as a quantitative measure of the amount of aerosol particles in the atmospheric column. The Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), at an altitude of 705 km with a swath width of 380 km, is aboard the polar-orbiting NASA EOS Terra platform, which passes over at approximately 10:30 local time. The MISR has nine viewing angles along the direction of the satellite motion in four spectral bands (446 nm, 558 nm, 672 nm, and 866 nm) and is capable of providing globally continuous retrievals of AOD on the daylit portion of the Earth as well as information on aerosol components and microphysical properties. Since December 2007, the MISR Version 22 (V22) operational aerosol retrieval algorithm has been in production, which has added additional absorbing spherical particles and a selection of multimodal aerosol mixtures to the climatology to improve the retrieval accuracy. Many studies have demonstrated that high-accuracy MISR AOD observations can be used to analyze the spatial-temporal distributions of aerosol loadings over some regions and even globally, to establish inter-comparisons of multiple satellite sensors for a better dataset. The advantage of having aerosol component information and microphysical properties enables MISR AOD observations to be successfully used to estimate near-surface total PM2.5 in both the eastern and western US, as well as the sulfate component concentration of PM2.5."
