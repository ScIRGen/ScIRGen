            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with the airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Linze station foci experimental area on May 30, 2008. WiDAS, composed of four CCD cameras, one mid-infrared thermal imager (AGEMA 550), and one infrared thermal imager (S60), can acquire CCD, MIR and TIR band data. The simultaneous ground data included:\n     (1) soil moisture (0-5cm) measured nine times by the cutting ring method (50cm^3) along LY07 and LY08 quadrates, and once by the cutting ring method and once by ML2X Soil Moisture Tachometer in the six points of Wulidun farmland quadrates. The preprocessed soil volumetric moisture data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) surface radiative temperature measured by two handheld infrared thermometer (5# and 6# from Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute which were both calibrated) in the LY07 and LY08 quadrates (98 sample points and repeated three times) and the Wulidun farmland quadrates (various points and repeated three times). Data were archived as Excel files.\n     (3) spectrum of maize, soil and soil with known moisture measured by ASD Spectroradiometer (350～2 500 nm) from BNU,and the 40% reference board in Wulidun farmland quadrate and the desert transit zone strips. Raw spectral data were archived as binary files, which were recorded daily in detail, and pre-processed data on reflectance were archived as Excel files. \n     (4) maize BRDF measured by ASD Spectroradiometer (350～2 500 nm) from BNU, the 40% reference board, two observation platforms of BNU make and one of Institute of Remote Sensing Applications make in Wulidun farmland quadrate and the desert transit zone strips. Raw spectral data were archived as binary files , which were recorded daily in detail, and pre-processed data on reflectance and transmittivity (read by ViewSpecPro) were archived as text files (.txt).\n     (5) LAI of maize, poplar and the desert scrub measured by the fisheye camera (CANON EOS40D with a lens of EF15/28), shooting straight downwards, with exceptions of higher plants, which were shot upwards in Wulidun farmland quadrate I, the desert transit zone and the poplar forest. Data included original photos (.JPG) and those processed by can_eye5.0 (in excel). \n     (6) LAI measured by the ruler and the set square in D and H quadrates of the Wulidun farmland. Part of the samples were also measured by LI-3100 and compared with those by manual work for further correction. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",

In remote sensing experiments, this approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of surface properties and can improve the accuracy of data such as reflectance and emissivity by accounting for directional effects.",

                    "Answer": "The use of a fish-eye camera involves taking photographs using a Canon EOS40D camera with a fisheye lens, which allows for the capture of wide-angle images from different angles, and processing these images with software like can_eye5.0 to calculate LAI. This method provides a non-destructive and potentially faster way of collecting LAI data compared to manual methods. In contrast, manual measurement involves using rulers and triangle plates to physically measure leaf length and width, which requires more time and labor but might offer direct measurement accuracy. Both methods ultimately aim to estimate the leaf area, but the fish-eye camera method can cover larger areas more quickly, whereas manual measurements might be more precise for smaller sample sizes. The results from manual measurements are also directly compared to LAI-3100 measurements to correct and refine the manual data.",

                    "Answer": "For surface radiation temperature, handheld infrared thermometers are used, and these instruments are calibrated by fitting the measured temperatures with blackbody temperatures to obtain a linear equation for calibration. For soil moisture, a ring knife with a volume of 50 cm^3 and an ML2X soil moisture rapid tester are used to measure the moisture of the 0-5 cm surface soil. Calibration data and procedures ensure the measurements are accurate, and the data is stored in Excel format for further analysis.",
