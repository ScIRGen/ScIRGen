            "description": "This dataset is a daily lake surface water temperature (LSWT) products of 164 lakes in Tibetan Plateau from 1978 to 2017. Firstly, we calculate the mean values of lake surface pixels based on MOD11A1 products to obtained the daily lake surface temperature series from 2000 to 2017. Secondly, we modified the air2water model to simulate the lake surface temperature continuously.  The daily air temperature from meteorological stations were used as forcing data, and the lake surface temperature monitored by MOD11A1 as the model calibration and validation data. Finally, the daily lake surface temperature across Tibet Plateau from 1978 to 2017 were reconstructed. Compared with the results from remote sensing monitoring, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of all lakes are higher than 0.6 with bias ranging at ±0.55℃. The dataset is suitable to analyze the long-term changes of lake surface temperature over the past decades, which is of great significance for assessing the impacts of climate warming on the water and heat balance, water quality and lake ecosystem changes on the Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The method of using MOD11A1 product data involves obtaining pixel mean values to create a daily lake surface temperature sequence from 2000 to 2017. In contrast, the improved air2water lake temperature model allows for the daily continuous simulation of lake surface temperatures throughout the year. The former relies on remote sensing data, while the latter uses meteorological station daily air temperature data as model driving data and MOD11A1 monitored lake surface temperature for model calibration and validation. Both methods are used in conjunction to reconstruct a long-term series of daily lake surface temperatures from 1978 to 2017, achieving high Nash efficiency coefficients and minimal biases in comparison to remote sensing results.",

This approach, combined with the air2water model and meteorological station temperature data, facilitates the reconstruction of a continuous daily lake surface temperature series for the period 1978 to 2017. This reconstructed temperature data provides valuable insights into the long-term climate trends on the Tibetan Plateau by enabling analysis of the changes in lake surface temperature over several decades.",

Next, an improved lake water temperature model, air2water, is used to simulate daily continuous lake surface temperatures throughout the year. This model uses daily air temperature data from meteorological stations as the driving data and calibrates and validates the model using the lake surface temperature monitored by MOD11A1. This process helps reconstruct the daily lake surface temperature sequence from 1978 to 2017 for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",
