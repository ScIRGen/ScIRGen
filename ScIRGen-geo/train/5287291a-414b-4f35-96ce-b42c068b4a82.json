            "description": "This data set is the profile of atmospheric aerosol extinction coefficient observed by lidar at Everest station. The original data detected by lidar are inversed by using the Fernald method. In the inversion process, the radar ratio is fixed at 30 Sr. assuming that the range independent radar ratio may cause inversion error of about 5-12%. The lidar blind zone and transition zone are 0.1 km and 0.3 km respectively. The time resolution is 5-20 minutes, the vertical resolution is 7.5m, and the maximum height is about 2km. The observation data include March, July, November 2018 and January 2019. These data can be used to evaluate the vertical characteristics of aerosols over the plateau and further to quantify the characteristics of aerosol transport over the plateau.",

It involves utilizing lidar-detected raw data to reverse-engineer the extinction coefficients by assuming a fixed lidar ratio, which is 30 Sr in this context. The method assumes that this lidar ratio does not vary with distance, which can introduce inversion errors approximately between 5-12%.",

This assumption might introduce retrieval errors ranging from 5-12%. Additionally, the presence of blind and transition zones in the laser radar measurements at 0.1 km and 0.3 km, respectively, could contribute to inaccuracies.",
