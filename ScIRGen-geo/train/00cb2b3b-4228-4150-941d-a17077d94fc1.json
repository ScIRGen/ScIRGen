            "description": "The data involved three periods of geodetic glacier mass storage change of three Rongbuk glaciers and its debris-covered ice in the Rongbuk Catchment from 1974-2016 (unit: m w.e. a-1). It is stored in the ESRI vector polygon format. The data sets are composed of three periods of glacier surface elevation difference between 1974-2000，2000-2016 and 1974-2006, i.e. DHPRISM2006-DEM1974（DH2006-1974）、DHSRTM2000-DEM1974（DH2000-1974）、DHASTER2016-SRTM2000（DH2016-2000）. DH2006-1974 was surface elevation change between ALOS/PRISMDEM(PRISM2006) and DEM1974, i.e. the DEM1974 was subtracted from PRISM2006, DH2006-1974 =PRISM2006 – DEM1974. The PRISM2006 was generated from stereo pairs of ALOS/PRISM on 4 Dec. 2006. The earlier historical DEM (DEM1974, spatial resolution 25m) was derived from 1:50,000 topographic maps in October 1974(DEM1974,spatial resolution 25m). The uncertainty in the ice free areas of DHPRISM2006-DEM1974 was ±0.24 m a-1. DHSRTM2000-DEM1974（DH2000-1974）was surface elevation change between SRTM DEM(SRTM2000) and DEM1974. The uncertainty in the ice free areas of DHSRTM2000-DEM1974 was ±0.13 m a-1. DHASTER2016-SRTM2000（DH2016-2000）was the surface elevation change between ASTER DEM2016 and SRTM DEM(SRTM2000). The uncertainty in the ice free areas of DHASTER2016-SRTM2000 was ±0.08 m a-1. Glacier-averaged annual mass balance change (m w.e.a-1) was averaged annually for each glacier, which was calculated by DH2006-1974/DH2000-1974/DH2016-2000, glacier coverage area and ice density of 850 ± 60 kg m−3.  The attribute data includes Glacier area by Shape_Area (m2), EC2000-1974/EC2016-2000/EC2006-1974, i.e. Glacier-averaged surface elevation change in each period(m a-1), MB2000-1974/ MB2016-2000/MB2006-1974, i.e. Glacier-averaged annual mass balance in each period (m w.e.a-1), and MC2000-1974/ MC2016-2000/MC2006-1974,Glacier-averaged annual mass change in each period(m3 w.e.a-1), Uncerty_EC is the maximum uncertainty of glacier surface elevation change（m a-1）、Uncerty_MB, is the maximum uncertainty of glacier mass balance（m w.e. a-1），Uncerty_MC, is the maximum uncertainty of glacier mass change（m3w.e. a-1）。 MinUnty_EC，is the minimum uncertainty of glacier surface elevation change，MinUnty_MB，is the minimum uncertainty of glacier mass balance（m w.e. a-1），MinUnty_MC is the minimum uncertainty of glacier mass change（m3 w.e. a-1.The data sets could be used for glacier change, hydrological and climate change studies in the Himalayas and High Mountain Asia.",

                "It is well known that glaciers in mountains are retreating widely in a warmer climate during recent decades on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The runoffs from both glaciers and glacier lakes have been increased significantly, and the potential outbursts of glacier lakes have threatened the residence safety in China and the adjacent countries. However, most of the glaciers locate in very distant mountains. As glaciers are difficult to be investigated due to the huge investments and long traveling time of field surveys, remote sensing monitoring has been the major approach adopted to understand the changes of glaciers nowadays. Mountain glaciers, especially those in temperate regions, are considered one of the best natural indicators of climate change. In recent years, the contribution of glaciers to the rise in lake and sea levels has also received increasing attention, with global glacier melting contributing 29±13% to sea level rise, and global glaciers and ice caps contributing 61±19% to sea level rise. The Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent mountain regions have developed glaciers covering an area of about 50,000 km², which is the largest glacier area in the mid-low latitude region outside the polar regions, and is the source of many famous rivers in Asia, as well as a precious water resource in the arid inland areas. Glacier activity is an important factor inducing glacier debris flow, ice/snow avalanches, and glacier lake outburst floods, with glacier floods often being one of the most impactful glacier disasters. For example, glacier melting leads to the formation and expansion of moraine lakes, and glacier flood disasters caused by moraine or ice-dammed lakes frequently occur, posing catastrophic threats to the safety of life and property in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan regions, affecting countries like China, India, and Nepal. Therefore, with the deepening of global change research, studies on glacier changes (including area, thickness, and ice reserves) are becoming increasingly important, with significant implications for global water resources and climate change, as well as disaster warning."
