            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of meteorological elements from the Bajitan Gobi Desert Station, which is located along the middle reaches of the Heihe Hydro-meteorological Observation Network, and the data set covers data from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The station is located in Bajitan, West Zhangye City, Gansu Province, the underlying surface is Gobi. The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 100.3042E, 38.9150N, and the altitude is 1562m. The air temperature and relative humidity sensors are erected 5 and 10 meters above the ground, facing North; the barometer is installed 2 meters above the ground; tipping bucket rain gauge is installed 10 meters above the ground; the wind speed sensors are set 5 and 10 meters above the ground, facing North; the four-component radiometer is installed 6 meters above the ground, facing South; two infrared thermometers are installed 6 meters above the ground, facing South, and the probe orientation is vertical downward; the soil temperature probes are buried respectively at 0cm on the ground surface, 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 100cm under the ground, they are located 2 meters from the meteorological tower in the North. The soil moisture sensors are buried 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 100cm under the ground, 2 meters from the meteorological tower in the South; the soil heat flow boards (3 pieces) are buried 6cm under the ground. \nObserved items include: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5m、RH_5m、Ta_10m、RH_10m) (unit: Celsius, percentage), pressure(Press) (unit:hectopascal), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), wind speed (WS_5m、WS_10m) (unit: meter / sec), wind direction (WD_10m) (unit: degree), four-component radiation (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watt / square meter), surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit: Celsius) , soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watt / square meter), soil moisture (Ms_2cm、Ms_4cm、Ms_10cm、Ms_20cm、Ms_40cm、Ms_60cm、Ms_100cm) (unit: volumetric water content, percentage), soil temperature (Ts_0cm、Ts_2cm、Ts_4cm、Ts_10cm、Ts_20cm、Ts_40cm、Ts_60cm、Ts_100cm) (unit : Celsius).\nProcessing and quality control of observation data: (1) Ensure 144 data per day (every 10 minutes), if there is missing data, it is marked as -6999. Due to sensor problem, Ms_40cm data between January 1 and March 2 had a large fluctuation, it can only be used as reference. (2) Eliminate moments with duplicate records; (3) Remove data that is significantly beyond physical meaning or beyond the measuring range of the instrument; (4) Data marked by red is debatable; (5) The formats of the date and time are uniform, and the date and time are in the same column. For example, the time is: 2014-6-10 10:30; (6) The naming rule is: AWS + site name.\nFor hydro-meteorological network or site information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018). For observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2011).",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

The estimated E/ET% and E/ET% values agreed well with the values observed using the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes technique during the early, middle, and late growing seasons.
