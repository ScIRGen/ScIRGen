            "description": "The data of major and trace elements were analysed by ICP-MS at the State Key Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Zircon U-Pb ages and trace elements were analysed by LA-ICP-MS at the Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny of CAS, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The international standard samples and reference values measured in the same batch are consistent within the error range, with low blank in the whole process. The samples of YMS and FS batholiths range from diorite to granite (52‒75 wt. % SiO2), and both show the higher bulk rock Fe3+/ΣFe ratios (between 0.3 and 0.6). The Fe3+/ΣFe of low silica (SiO2<65 wt. %) samples of Dabie are consistent with YMS and FS, but the high SiO2 samples show the low ratios (between 0.1 and 0.3) . Compared with MORB, all the samples show the high ƒO2.Majority of zircons Ce4+/Ce3+ and Eu/Eu* ratios are mostly in range of 100-1000, and consistent with ore-bearing porphyries in Chile and China (e.g., Dexing), indicating the high ƒO2. Conversely, the inherited zircon (~2.5 Ga) Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios of Liguo and FS plutons range from 10 to 200, similar to those of ore barren porphyries in Chile, i.e. low ƒO2 .That adakitic rocks with high oxygen fugacity are very widespread in the NCC. Those magmas were derived from partial melting of thickened lower continental crust with the mixing of mantle materials, and the high ƒO2 characteristic inherited from an oxidized mantle source that has been modified by fluids and/or melt derived from (Paleo)-Pacific plate.",

                    "Answer": "The major elements in geological datasets from North China were determined using ICP-MS, which is noted for its reliability and accuracy, as confirmed by consistency with international standards and low procedural blanks. In contrast, trace element data in zircon were measured using LA-ICP-MS, which also demonstrated high data quality and accuracy. Both methods provided data consistent with international reference values, indicating reliable data collection techniques for both major and trace elements.",

                    "Answer": "The Fe3+/ΣFe ratios observed in rock bodies, ranging from 0.3 to 0.6, are influenced by the high oxygen fugacity characteristics inherited from oxidized mantle wedges. This is primarily due to the introduction of large amounts of oxidizing fluids and materials into the mantle wedge during the subduction of the ancient Pacific plate.",

This ensures that the data quality is accurate and reliable, as evidenced by the consistent results for both major and trace elements in rock samples from diverse geological settings such as the Yunmeng Mountain and Fangshan plutons.",

This data is crucial for revealing the geochemical behavior and genesis of these rocks, as well as their similarities to porphyry copper deposits in Chile and Dexing, which can provide insights into the broader geological processes and magmatic sources in the North China region.",

Consistency is checked by comparing international standards and reference values, ensuring that discrepancies are within acceptable error ranges. Low levels of full-process blank indicate high data quality, and the consistent silica content range of 52% to 75% in the samples further supports reliability.",
