Within CMIP6, the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) aims to generate multi-model climate projections for alternate scenarios of future emissions and land-use changes produced with integrated assessment models. The US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project is a new and ongoing climate modeling effort to develop a state-of-the-art Earth system model. The E3SM project aims to develop code optimized for DOE’s high-performance computing infrastructure and to advance Earth system prediction of changes in environmental variables that are critical to energy-sector decisions, such as regional trends in air and water temperatures, water availability, storms and heavy precipitation, coastal flooding, and sea-level rise (Bader et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020). E3SM version 1.0 (E3SMv1.0) at the standard horizontal resolution of ∼100 km reported a high ECS of 5.3 K, a high transient climate response (TCR) of 2.93 K, along with a strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFaero) of −1.65 W m−2 (Golaz et al., 2019). Previous estimates found that the net positive cloud feedback of 0.94 W m−2 K−1 in E3SMv1.0 is too strong compared with other CMIP6 models at the range of 0.42 ±0.36 W m−2 K−1 (Zelinka et al., 2020, Table S1)."

Firstly, document future climate characteristics of E3SMv1.0 (which is a model member of the ScenarioMIP project) at the highest emission scenario along with its historical climate evolution. Secondly, we describe regional responses of key climate components in the GHG-only simulations. The difference between the high-emission all-forcing experiment and the GHG-only experiment is analyzed."

The GHG-only future projection simulations (future_Pn-SSP5-8.5-GHG) use the end of the historical_Hn simulations as the starting points and use the GHG forcing in the SSP5-8.5 scenario, while the other forcings are still set at the same pre-industrial values as historical_Hn-GHG."

The global mean precipitation in E3SMv1.0 increases by >0.3 mm d−1 from the end of the historical period (year 2014) to the end of the future projection (year 2099). The global mean Tair changes in the E3SMv1.0 ensemble members are comparable to the CMIP6 models with the highest warming. The global pattern of Tair change between 2070–2099 and 1985–2014 reveals a polar amplification of surface warming and interhemispheric asymmetric warming. The global mean precipitation increases by ∼10 % due to the warmer climate."

                    "Answer": "Using an ensemble mean data approach in climate modeling can lead to a more robust understanding of climate variability and trends by averaging out individual model biases and uncertainties. However, it may also mask extreme events or anomalies present in individual ensemble members, potentially underestimating rare but impactful phenomena in atmospheric and land components.",

                    "Answer": "Focusing on GHG-only simulations can clarify the direct effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate projections, highlighting temperature and precipitation changes attributable solely to GHGs. This approach may, however, overlook interactions with other forcings, such as aerosols or land-use changes, leading to incomplete projections in high-emissions scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "Using pre-industrial values for all forcings other than GHGs in simulations can isolate the impact of GHG emissions on climate systems, providing clear insights into their specific contributions. This may result in a simplified representation of reality, as it excludes potential feedbacks and interactions with other anthropogenic or natural forcings that could alter climate projections.",

For future projections, the simulations start from the end of historical simulations and use GHG forcing from a specific scenario, while other forcings remain at pre-industrial levels.",
