                    "Answer": "The 'air freeze-thaw index' refers to a calculated measure based on the monthly observed temperature data from conventional meteorological stations. It represents the annual frequency of freeze-thaw cycles in the air, which is derived from temperature records. For the Heihe River Basin, the index was computed using data collected by the China Meteorological Administration from 1960 to 2004, with spatial distribution maps created using a regression relationship between the index and altitude, aided by 1km DEM data.",

By regressing the long-term average air freeze-thaw index values against elevation and using DEM data, researchers can derive a more accurate spatial model that represents climatic variations across different altitudes.",

Additionally, the regression relationship between the multi-year average air freeze-thaw index and elevation plays a crucial role, as does the precision of the 1km DEM data used to construct the spatial distribution map of the index.",

                    "Answer": "Using the regression relationship between multi-year average air freeze-thaw indices and elevation, combined with 1km DEM data, allows for the creation of a spatial distribution map for the Heihe River Basin. This approach likely improves the spatial resolution and accuracy of the index by accounting for elevation variability, which may not be captured by sparse meteorological stations alone.",

                    "Answer": "To compute air freeze-thaw indices, temperature observations from meteorological stations in a river basin are utilized. These indices are calculated based on the monthly temperature data provided by the meteorological stations. The process involves determining the annual air freeze-thaw indices for each station and then deriving their long-term averages over a specified period, such as from 1960 to 2004. Additionally, a regression relationship between the long-term average air freeze-thaw indices and elevation is established. This relationship, along with 1km DEM data, is used to construct a spatial distribution map of the air freeze-thaw indices for the river basin.",
