            "description": "The data set includes the river level observation data of point 2 in the dense runoff observation of the middle reaches of Heihe River from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The observation point is located in Heihe bridge, 312 National Road, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The riverbed is sandy gravel with unstable section. The longitude and latitude of the observation point are n38.996667 °, e100.427222 °, altitude 1485m, river width 70m and 20m. Sr50 ultrasonic range finder is used for water level observation, with acquisition frequency of 30 minutes. The data includes the following parts:            \nWater level observation, observation frequency 30 minutes, unit (CM);            \nIn 2015, the section of bridge no.2-312 was frequently disturbed by human beings. The dam was built within 1km of the upstream and downstream of the section. The unstable area of the hydrological section led to the disorder of the water level and flow curve. During the measurement, the stable flow and water level curve could not be obtained.            \nThe observation of water level is based on the manual observation of water level at 0:00 on January 1, 2015. In the later stage, the hydrological section of river undercut changes. The result is that the datum water level changes and negative value appears;            \nRefer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or station information, and he et al. (2016) for observation data processing",

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
