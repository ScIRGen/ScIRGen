            "description": "The s Slope Length and Stepness Factor (LS) dataset of pan-third pole area is calculated based on the free accessed 1-arc-second resolution SRTM digital elevation data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, SRTM; the website is http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org）. After some pre-processing such as pseudo edge removal, filtering and noise removal, the LS factor with 30 arc second resolution was calculated by using the LS factor algorithm in CSLE model and the LS calculation tool developed in this project (LS_tool). The LS factor data of Pan-third pole area is the necessary data for soil erosion rate calculation based on CSLE, and analyzing the erosion topographic characteristics of Pan third pole area (such as macro distribution and micro pattern of elevation, slope and slope) , the dataset also has reference value for the analysis of geomorphic characteristics and geological disaster characteristics in this area.",

                    "Answer": "The 'slope length and steepness factor (LS)' refers to a component within the CSLE (Chinese Soil Loss Equation) model used for calculating soil erosion rates. It is derived from digital elevation data, specifically the SRTM digital elevation data, and is processed to remove noise and artifacts. The LS factor is essential for analyzing erosion terrain characteristics and contributes to understanding geomorphological and geological hazard features in a specific region.",

                    "Answer": "The necessity for preprocessing steps such as edge smoothing and noise filtering arises from the need to enhance the quality of the digital elevation data. SRTM data, being publicly available at 1-arc second resolution, may contain artifacts such as edge discontinuities and noise that can lead to inaccuracies. These preprocessing steps help in creating a more accurate and reliable dataset by removing false stripes and imperfections, allowing for precise calculation of slope length and steepness factors, which are crucial for soil erosion rate calculations and the analysis of erosion terrain characteristics.",
