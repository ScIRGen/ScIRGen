            "description": "The SZIsnow dataset was calculated based on systematic physical fields from the Global Land Data Assimilation System version 2 (GLDAS-2) with the Noah land surface model. This SZIsnow dataset considers different physical water-energy processes, especially snow processes. The evaluation shows the dataset is capable of investigating different types of droughts across different timescales. The assessment also indicates that the dataset has an adequate performance to capture droughts across different spatial scales. The consideration of snow processes improved the capability of SZIsnow, and the improvement is evident over snow-covered areas (e.g., Arctic region) and high-altitude areas (e.g., Tibet Plateau). Moreover, the analysis also implies that SZIsnow dataset is able to well capture the large-scale drought events across the world. This drought dataset has high application potential for monitoring, assessing, and supplying information of drought, and also can serve as a valuable resource for drought studies.",

                "Drought indices do not always provide the most relevant information for water resources management as most of them neglect the role of snow in the land surface water balance. Determining the occurrence and evolution of drought at various temporal scales is a challenging task due to the lack of long-term measurements of surface water-energy fluxes and states, including streamflow, radiation, evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, and snow water equivalent (SWE). A precipitation deficiency is primarily referred to as meteorological drought; a hydrological drought is commonly caused by a deficit in streamflow or low surface and groundwater levels; and an agricultural drought mainly results from low levels of soil moisture storage. Increased temperatures and atmospheric evaporative demand is expected to reduce the amount of snowfall and SWE resulting in more frequent or intense droughts. Several studies have shown that warming processes, resulting in increased ET and/or soil moisture deficits, markedly affect the severity of droughts. A prolonged imbalance of surface water and moisture deficiencies caused by the changing snowpack could result in more frequent hydrological and agricultural droughts, further threatening water security. A number of efforts have been undertaken to develop methods for drought characterization; however, they generally neglect the effects of snow dynamics on drought evolution. The above described limitations of current drought indices highlight the need to incorporate snow information into a drought index such as the SZI to better characterize, model, and forecast droughts worldwide."

                "Drought is recognized as one of the costliest natural disasters in the world, resulting in 55% of the economic losses caused by natural disasters. Based on an analysis of precipitation, streamflow, and drought indices, Dai indicated that the area of global drought has increased significantly since 1950 in many regions. Northern China, as the largest drought-prone region, experienced severe droughts during the second half of the twentieth century, and the most severe and prolonged droughts have occurred since 1990. Drought is a complex climate phenomenon that results mainly from a long-term deficiency in precipitation. It is defined in several different ways in terms of applications. These different definitions make it difficult to objectively quantify drought features such as magnitude, duration, and spatial extent. Drought indices are a common way to identify drought events, and development of such an index for varied applications is essential to water resource prediction and management. Two prominent drought indices that have been widely used in climate and hydrology studies are (1) the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), based on the water balance equation, and (2) the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), based on a probabilistic precipitation approach. The PDSI uses a water balance model to compute the cumulative moisture departure on the land surface. However, the PDSI still lacks the ability to identify drought events within a watershed at multiple timescales. The main limitation of the SPI is that it is based on precipitation and ignores the effects of atmospheric water demand."

It performs better in capturing hydrological and agricultural droughts compared to indices that do not consider snow. The VIC model, on the other hand, uses soil moisture data among other hydrological inputs to evaluate drought indices, focusing more on soil water content changes.
