We used PowerMax Soil Kit of Qiagen company in Germany to extract DNA, then used universal plant primer g-h (Taberlet et et al., 2007) to amplify P6 loop of chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron in the sample. The PCR products were then sent to Fasteris company in Switzerland for the next-generation paired-end sequencing. The sequencing instrument is Illumina Nextseq 550.

                "Arctic and high-elevation ecosystems are very sensitive to natural and anthropogenically-induced climate variability. Anthropogenic warming and changes in land-use have been considered to shift vegetation composition and plant richness in these areas during the last centuries and decades. Modern plant sedDNA data, as a modern training-set, can be applied to reconstruct past vegetation types in alpine and arctic ecosystems, which in pollen-based reconstruction, can be largely biased due to the presence of poor modern pollen analogues. Since the last decade, plant sedDNA have been applied to lake surface-sediment samples to identify modern plant communities and to lake sediment cores to reconstruct local plant diversity changes in the past. Typically, plant sedDNA is retrieved by a metabarcoding approach that utilises the g/h primers that amplify a short fragment of the trnL P6 loop of the plant chloroplast genome. The P6 loop markers have been widely applied for the identification of plants in lake sediment samples and other environmental samples, such as soils, permafrost, and mock samples. For lake sediments, the use of P6 loop markers allows an identification of plants to a low taxonomic level and the recognition of more taxa from the local lake catchment. As plant diversity obtained from lakes' sedDNA reflects local plant communities, it is more suitable to reconstruct the past local plant diversity."
