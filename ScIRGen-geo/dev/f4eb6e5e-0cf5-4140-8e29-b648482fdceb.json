            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) mission in the Linze station foci experimental area on Jul. 4, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) soil moisture (0-5cm) measured by the cutting ring method (50cm^3) from sample points of the P1 to P6 strips (17 sample points each),. Photos were also taken. The preprocessed soil volumetric moisture data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) surface radiative temperature measured by the three handheld infrared thermometer (5# and 6# from Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, and one from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources, which were all calibrated) from P1 to P6 strips quadrates. There are 34 sample points in total and each was repeated three times synchronizing with the airplane. Photos were taken. Data were archived as Excel files. \n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",
