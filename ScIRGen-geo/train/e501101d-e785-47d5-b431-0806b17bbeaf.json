                    "Answer": "The 'photographic method' for measuring surface roughness refers to using a digital camera to capture images of a surface, marked with measurement indicators, to analyze and quantify the roughness of that surface. In the context of remote sensing experiments, this method involves using custom equipment like a roughness board and compass to systematically collect data along predetermined diagonals of sample areas. This technique is designed to provide accurate measurements of surface roughness, which can be crucial for understanding land surface characteristics and informing remote sensing analysis.",

                    "Answer": "In the field mentioned, surface roughness in desert areas was measured using photographic methods with a custom roughness board, digital camera, and compass. This method involves taking photographs along diagonal lines at regular intervals in two directions (east-west and north-south). The use of photographic methods allows for direct visual documentation and can be relatively practical and cost-effective. However, it may differ in accuracy compared to technologies like LIDAR or RADAR, which can provide more precise, large-scale, and continuous data but are typically more expensive and complex to deploy.",

The use of custom roughness boards, a digital camera, and a compass allows for accurate data collection along two diagonal lines in each plot, accommodating the unique characteristics of the terrain and ensuring consistency in the measurements.",

The instruments required include a custom-made roughness board, a digital camera, and a compass. Measurements are conducted by sampling along two diagonal lines of the desert sample plots at regular intervals, capturing both east-west and north-south orientations. Each photograph must include measurement markers to ensure accuracy.",
