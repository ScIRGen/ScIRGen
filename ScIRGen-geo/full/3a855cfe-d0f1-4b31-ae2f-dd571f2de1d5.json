The crushing and zircon selection of samples were completed in Langfang Chengxin Geological Service Co., Ltd; Zircon U-Pb dating was done at the State Key Laboratory of Earthquake Dynamics, Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). At least 200 zircon grains were randomly selected to adhere to double-sided adhesive, and were poured into the laser sample target with epoxy resin. All samples were ablated by using a laser beam with a diameter of 28μm, a frequency of 10 Hz and laser energy density of 4.0J/cm 2 .",

                    "Answer": "The choice of sandstones as the primary source for collecting detrital zircon samples is likely due to their prevalent occurrence in the sedimentary layers of interest in the Sichuan, Xichang, Huili, and Chuxiong basins during the Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic. Sandstones are ideal for zircon extraction because they contain abundant zircon grains, which can be accurately dated using U-Pb dating methods. This provides valuable chronological information about the sedimentary processes and geological history of the region over the last 100 million years.",

This data provides insights into the tectonic activities and sedimentary processes over the past 100 million years, helping researchers to reconstruct paleogeographic environments and understand the provenance of sediments. The methodology involves collecting sandstones, crushing samples, and selecting zircons, which are then dated using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), allowing for precise age determination critical for these geological studies.",

                    "Answer": "The collection and analysis of detrital zircon age data involve several key steps. Initially, all detrital zircon samples are collected from sandstone in regions such as the Sichuan Basin, Xichang Basin, Huili Basin, and Chuxiong Basin. The sample crushing and zircon selection processes are conducted by a geological service company. For age determination, U-Pb dating is performed using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) at a national key laboratory. During the analysis, at least 200 zircon grains are randomly selected and mounted on double-sided adhesive tape, which are then embedded in an epoxy resin to form a laser sample target. The laser used in testing has a beam spot diameter of 28 μm, a frequency of 10 Hz, and an energy density of 4.0 J/cm2.",
