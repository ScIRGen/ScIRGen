The imagery undergoes systematic geometric correction to align with the L2 product level standards, ensuring accurate spatial representation. This involves correcting distortions caused by sensor orientation, satellite motion, and topographic variations. The corrected images are then ready for analysis, such as land cover classification or change detection, specific to river basin studies like those in the Heihe River Basin.",
