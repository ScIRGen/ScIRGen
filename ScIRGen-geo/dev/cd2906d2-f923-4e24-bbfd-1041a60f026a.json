            "description": "The data sources of this dataset mainly include domestic satellite images such as HJ-1A/B, GF-1/2, ZY-3, and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI series satellite image data. Using the domestic satellite images supplemented by Google Earth images to generate the component training sample and validation sample data of different geographical divisions. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to test and correct the model algorithm parameters. The normalized settlement density index (NSDI) is obtained based on random forest algorithm, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI series satellite images and auxiliary data. The vector boundary of urban built-up area is obtained by density segmentation method after manual interactive interpretation and correction. The NSDI, vegetation coverage index and vector boundary of the Tibetan Plateau are used to produce the original data of urban impervious surface and urban green space fractions in the Tibetan Plateau. After correction and accuracy evaluation, the datasets of urban impervious surface area and green space fractions in the Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2020 are generated. \nThe resolution of the data product is 30 m, and the coordinate system and storage format of the data files are unified. The geographic coordinate system is WGS84, the projected coordinate system is Albers, and the data storage format is GeoTIFF, the data unit is percentage (the value range is 0~10000), and the scale factor is 0.01.\nIn order to quantify the change of urban land cover more accurately, samples from several typical cities are selected to verify the dataset. The specific verification methods and accuracy are shown in the published results.\nThe data can be used to analyze and reveal the impact of land cover change and future scenario simulation on the Tibetan Plateau, to provide a scientific basis for building environmentally livable cities and improving the quality of human settlements on the Tibetan Plateau.",

Currently, urban areas accommodate 55% of the global population, contribute 75% of global gross domestic product (GDP), and produce 75% of global carbon emissions in energy use. Cities symbolize the most intensified land-use activities within coupled human–environment systems. As a result, urbanization can influence the biophysical and biochemical processes, i.e., land-cover change, surface radiation and energy changes, hydrologic processes, and materials cycles, among others, all of which affect cropland encroachments, urban heat islands, rain flood disasters, biodiversity loss, and climate change in many ways. Therefore, new knowledge about global urban land cover is essential to address urban-related issues of environmental sustainability through science–policy interfaces. As the two foundation components of urban land or built-up areas, urban impervious surface area (ISA) and green space (GS) are important for building a better urban future that is livable, comfortable, and sustainable."

                "Accurate and timely maps of urban underlying land properties at the national scale are of significance in improving habitat environment and achieving sustainable development goals. Urban impervious surface (UIS) and urban green space (UGS) are two core components for characterizing urban underlying environments. However, the UIS and UGS are often mosaicked in the urban landscape with complex structures and composites. Although six mainstream datasets on global or national urban land use and land cover products with a 30 m spatial resolution have been developed, they only provide the binary pattern or dynamic of a single urban land type, which cannot effectively delineate the quantitative components or structure of intra-urban land cover. The effects of rapid urbanization on environments have been witnessed around the world and profoundly contribute to changes in biosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. In China, a rapid urbanization process emerged in the 21st century, resulting in a rapid increase in urban impervious surface area (UIS). This process further triggered various urban environmental problems such as urban heat islands and urban flooding. Although many green areas have been constructed in Chinese cities recently, China has a relatively lower percentage of urban green space (UGS) than developed countries such as the United States. These urban environmental problems triggered the urgency of developing accurate urban land cover datasets with high spatial resolutions for delineating the underlying urban environments. Various land use products such as the Global Land Cover product (GlobaLand30), the University of Maryland (UMD) Land Cover Classification, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land use and land cover products, GlobCover, and Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) are freely available worldwide. Most urban land products have focused on built-up land or urban area classification but cannot delineate urban land as a heterogeneous unit consisting of UIS, UGS and other fractions."

To address the above issues, we propose a synthetical strategy to utilize the advantage of both accurate urban boundary information from China’s Land Use/cover Dataset (CLUD) extracted by human–computer digitalization and the retrieval of UIS and UGS fractions through big-data processing from the GEE platform.

Firstly, the conceptual definition of urban land or ISA in previous research is unclear; thus, the spatial extent is inconsistent, resulting in a large divergence in the statistical area of urban land. Meanwhile, the segmentation on urban–rural boundaries has not been accurate from moderate-resolution satellite images using computer-based automatic classification owing to differences in geographic conditions, social economic conditions and land policies. Secondly, the spatial heterogeneity of urban surface properties has resulted in difficulty in decomposing urban land cover types with complex surface materials at the pixel scale, which has been limited by the huge amounts of data processing and storage capacities required for a 30 m resolution."

Finally, the products of China’s UIS and UGS fractions (CLUD-Urban) at a 30 m resolution were developed in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018. To acquire the accurate CLUD-Urban product, three steps were generally implemented according to our mapping strategy. Firstly, national urban boundaries in 2000–2018 were extracted from CLUD which was generated using a uniform technological flow and classification system in a human–computer digitalization environment. Secondly, the settlement and vegetation fractions with a 30 m resolution were retrieved using a random forest algorithm in the GEE platform.

In mapping CLUD, Landsat TM, ETM+and OLI in each period, China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program (CBERS) and Huan Jing (HJ-1A and HJ-1B) satellite images in 2010 were used to generate false-color composite images with near-infrared, red and green spectral bands as red, green and blue. Image enhancement was performed to improve the visual interpretation quality. Image-to-image registration was conducted to control the image rectification errors of less than 2 pixels (60 m). CBERS-1 and Huan Jing (HJ-1A and HJ-1B) satellite images were only used in extracting the vector polygons of CLUD in 2010, which was conducted using uniform data processing with Landsat images.

Our result indicates that 71 % of pixels of urban land were mosaicked by the UIS and UGS within cities in 2018; a single UIS classification may highly increase the mapping uncertainty. The high spatial heterogeneity of urban underlying covers was exhibited with average fractions of 68.21 % for UIS and 22.30 % for UGS in 2018 at a national scale. The UIS and UGS increased unprecedentedly with annual rates of 1605.56 and 627.78 km2 yr−1 in 2000–2018, driven by fast urbanization. The CLUD-Urban mapping can fill the knowledge gap in understanding impacts of the UIS and UGS patterns on ecosystem services and habitat environments and is valuable for detecting the hotspots of waterlogging and improving urban greening for planning and management practices."
