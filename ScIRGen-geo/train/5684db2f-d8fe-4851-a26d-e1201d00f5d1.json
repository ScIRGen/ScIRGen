            "description": "This data includes whole-rock major and trace geochemical data, plagioclase major element data, alkali feldspar major element data, muscovite major element data, tourmaline major element data, and monazite trace element data. The samples were collected from the Gaowu rock mass in the Yadong area, southern Tibet. The major elements in the whole rock were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) glass melting sheet method; The trace elements in the whole rock were dissolved by mixed acid dissolution method and tested by Quadrupole Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICPMS); The major mineral elements were analyzed by electron microprobe; The mineral trace elements were obtained by ArF excimer laser ablation system and quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The data obtained show that the Gaowu tourmaline muscovite granite shows the characteristics of high evolution magma.",

XRF provides robust data for major elements through its ability to analyze large sample areas, reducing heterogeneity issues, while Q-ICPMS offers high sensitivity for trace elements, allowing for detailed geochemical characterization. This combination can enhance the understanding of the geochemical evolution and composition of high-evolution magmas as observed in the granitic samples from the Gaowu pluton in Tibet.",

This can provide insights into the geological processes and conditions during the formation of these granites.",

Whole rock major elements are examined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) with glass fusion techniques. For whole rock trace elements, a mixed acid dissolution method is utilized followed by analysis with quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Q-ICPMS). Major elements in minerals are determined using electron probe microanalysis, while mineral trace elements are obtained using an ArF excimer laser ablation system coupled with Q-ICPMS.",
