            "description": "These data are a digitization of the frozen soil distribution map of the Map of the Glaciers, Frozen Ground and Deserts in China (1:4,000,000). Considering the unification with the global frozen soil classification system, the permafrost is divided into the following five types:\n(1) Discontinuous permafrost: continuous coefficient 50%-90%\n(2) Island permafrost: continuous coefficient <50%\n(3) Plateau discontinuous permafrost: continuous coefficient 50%-90%\n(4) Plateau island permafrost: continuous coefficient 50%-90%\n(5) Mountain permafrost\nThe compilation basis of the frozen soil map includes (1) the measured field survey data and exploration of frozen soil; (2) aerial image and satellite image interpretation; (3) TOPO30 1-km resolution ground elevation data; and (4) and temperature and ground temperature data. The distribution of frozen soil on the Tibetan Plateau adopted the research results of Zhuotong Nan et al. (2002). Using the average annual temperature data of 76 boreholes along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, a statistical regression analysis was performed to obtain the relation between annual mean ground temperature, latitude and elevation. Based on the relation combined with GTOPO30 elevation data (global 1-km digital elevation model data developed by the Earth Resources Observation and Technology Center of the U.S Geological Survey), the annual average ground temperature distribution over the entire Tibetan Plateau was simulated. Taking the annual average ground temperature of 0.5 °C as the boundary between permafrost and seasonal frozen soil and the Map of Snow Ice and Frozen Ground in China (1:4,000,000) (Yafeng Shi, et al., 1988) as a reference, the boundary between the plateau discontinuous permafrost and plateau island permafrost was determined. In addition, taking the Distributions Map of Permafrost in Daxiao Hinganling Northeast China (Dongxin Guo, et al. 1981), the Distribution Map of Permafrost and Ground Ice in Circum-Arctic (Brown et al. 1997) and the latest field data as references, the permafrost boundary of northeast China has been revised; the mountain permafrost boundary in the northwest mostly adopted the boundary delineated in the Map of Snow Ice and Frozen Ground in China (1:4,000,000) (Yafeng Shi, et al., 1988).\nAccording to this data set, permafrost area in China is approximately 1.75×106 km2, accounting for 18.25% of the territory of China, among which the mountain permafrost area is 0.29×106 km2, which accounts for 3.03% of the territory of China.\nFor more information, please refer to the Map of the Glaciers, Frozen Ground and Deserts in China (1:4,000,000) specification (Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2006).",

This model helps in understanding the relationship between temperature, latitude, and elevation, which is crucial for delineating permafrost boundaries and distinguishing between types of permafrost, such as discontinuous and island permafrost.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in accurately mapping permafrost distribution stem from various factors, including the reliance on diverse data sources such as field surveys, aerial images, satellite imagery, elevation data, and temperature records. The integration of these data types requires careful consideration of their resolution and accuracy. Additionally, the variability in permafrost characteristics, such as continuity and elevation, especially across different terrains like the Tibetan Plateau, adds complexity. The use of regression statistical analysis to correlate mean annual ground temperature with latitude and elevation introduces potential errors, particularly when extrapolating data across large regions. Furthermore, the need to reconcile and update existing maps with newer field measurements and global datasets, such as the GTOPO30 elevation data, also presents challenges in ensuring consistency and accuracy in permafrost mapping.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating multiple data sources like satellite imagery and field survey data can enhance the accuracy of permafrost distribution mapping by providing a more comprehensive view of the landscape. It allows for cross-verification of data, which can reduce errors and increase the reliability of the mapped permafrost boundaries. For instance, satellite imagery offers large-scale spatial coverage, while field survey data provides detailed ground-truthing information. This combination can help refine the classification of permafrost into categories like discontinuous and island permafrost, as seen in the Chinese context, where such integration has been used to delineate permafrost regions more precisely.",

                    "Answer": "The digitization and classification of permafrost distribution data involve considering a unified global permafrost classification system. This process includes categorizing permafrost into five types based on continuity coefficients, utilizing field survey data, aerial and satellite imagery interpretation, and ground elevation data at 1 km resolution. Additionally, regression statistical analysis is performed using borehole data to relate average annual ground temperature with latitude and elevation, combined with GTOPO30 elevation data to simulate temperature distribution.",
