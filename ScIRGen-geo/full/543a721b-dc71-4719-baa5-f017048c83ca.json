            "description": "The data include the major elements, trace elements and Sr – nd Pb isotopic data of volcanic rocks. Samples were collected from Cenozoic basalts in Wudi area, Eastern China. The whole rock major geochemical data were obtained by rigaku-zsx-100e X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF). The whole rock trace geochemical data were obtained by Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The whole rock SR – nd Pb isotopic compositions were obtained by sample separation and purification and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The age, origin and formation background of magmatism in the region can be defined by the data obtained. The obtained data can be used to infer the location and nature of himU reservoir in the mantle and evaluate the possible mechanism of producing highly heterogeneous mantle.",

This involves preparing the samples by crushing and grinding them into fine powders, which are then pressed into pellets or fused into glass discs. The XRF instrument is calibrated with standards, and the samples are analyzed to determine the concentration of major elements. The data collected are then processed and interpreted to understand the geochemical characteristics of the rocks.",
