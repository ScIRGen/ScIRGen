            "description": "Nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells into a pluripotent status has the potential to create patient-specific pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for regenerative medicine.   Currently, however, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying this pluripotent reprogramming are poorly understood.   To delineate this epigenetic regulatory network, we utilized a chromatin RNA in situ reverse transcription sequencing (CRIST-seq) approach to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) embedded in the 3-dimensional intrachromosomal architecture of stem cell core factor genes.  By combining CRIST-seq and RNA-seq, we identified Osilr9 (Oct4-Sox2 interacting lncRNA 9) as a pluripotency-associated lncRNA.   Osilr9 expression was associated with the status of stem cell pluripotency in reprogramming.   Using shRNA knockdown, we showed that this lncRNA was required for the optimal maintenance of stem cell pluripotency.   Overexpression of Osilr9 induced robust activation of endogenous stem cell core factor genes in fibroblasts.   Osilr9 participated in the formation of the intrachromosomal looping required for maintenance of pluripotency.   After binding to the Oct4 promoter, Osilr9 recruited the DNA demethylase  TET1, leading to promoter demethylation.   These data demonstrate that Osilr9 is a critical chromatin epigenetic modulator that coordinates the promoter activity of core stem cell factor genes, highlighting the critical role of pluripotency-associated lncRNAs in stem cell  pluripotency and reprogramming.",
