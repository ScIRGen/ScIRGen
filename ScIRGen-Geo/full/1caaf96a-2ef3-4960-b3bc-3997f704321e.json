HydroRIVERS has been extracted from the gridded HydroSHEDS core layers at 15 arc-second resolution. The global coverage of HydroRIVERS encompasses 8.5 million individual river reaches with an average length of 4.2 km, representing a total of 35.9 million km of rivers globally. HydroRIVERS only includes a limited amount of (mostly geometric) attribute information, such as the river reach length, the distance from upstream headwaters and ocean outlet, the river order, and an estimate of long-term average discharge. Every river reach is also co-registered to the sub-basin of the HydroBASINS database in which it resides (via a shared ID).\n",

        "Water is a vital necessity to sustain life on Earth, and many Earth system processes depend on the spatial and temporal distribution of freshwater resources. The hydrological cycle and its underlying physical processes have been studied intensely over the past decades, mostly with a focus on small- to medium-sized catchments. In recent years, however, the increasing pressures on freshwater resources from a multitude of complex and interacting factors that span all scales led to a growing recognition of the importance of large river systems. As in situ measurements of many hydrologic variables at large spatial and temporal scales are difficult and expensive, global hydrological models (GHMs) have emerged as our preferred research tool to analyze current and future world water resources. Despite the increased attention, hydrological modeling at large scales has traditionally been hampered by a number of issues, including general limitations in our knowledge and understanding of the underlying processes for many regions of the Earth; incomplete, inconsistent, or highly uncertain data collections; a lack of spatial integration between models and datasets; and the difficulty to create models that support multi-scale or coupled approaches. To achieve this goal, new and enhanced global datasets and tools describing the geographical distribution of hydrological features, characteristics, and processes will be required as this information is currently often unavailable or at low quality.",
        "Spatial information in GHMs is typically represented as layers of uniformly sized grid cells, also known as raster datasets. Vector datasets on the other hand consist of objects, represented as points at a certain location, or as a series of point locations chained together to form a line or polygon. Raster models have traditionally been the preferred choice of hydrological modelers since the integration of topography in the form of rasterized Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is a key requirement for many routing algorithms that trace water along drainage direction maps. Furthermore, many ancillary datasets stem from remotely sensed raster information (e.g. land cover, precipitation, etc.), and grids are relatively easy to process in any modern GIS. Hydrological connectivity is an important concept in both hydrology and ecology. Flows in traditional GHMs that include lateral transport occur on the premise of a river continuum whereby conditions at every location in the river network are influenced by upstream processes (Vannote et al., 1980). The advanced implementation of hydrological connectivity in a modeling framework is an attractive concept because of its ability to integrate processes from multiple disciplines (such as terrestrial, climate, ecological and hydrological); because of its easiness to represent spatially explicit topology information of a river network and watershed landscape (up- and downstream relations); and because of its intrinsic ability to establish connections across multiple scales– from point locations and river reaches to nested catchments and entire basins.",
        "The main limitations identified are related to spatial resolution, data structure, quality of data, inclusion of hydrological connectivity, and support of multi-scale and integrated modeling approaches."
      ],
      "research objective": [
        "In this paper, we argue that there is currently no comprehensive framework that can fully support integrated hydro-ecological modeling at the global scale; yet the building blocks of such a framework already exist. We will illustrate the current status and outline new directions for global scale hydro-ecological modeling to study the world’s large river systems. We propose an approach that combines existing and newly developed global scale hydrographic baseline data with a dedicated river routing model in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment, and we will present preliminary results of our own model development. Finally, we will show that such a framework can enable a broad range of hydro-ecological applications and operate at scales at which local decision making and management becomes feasible.",
        "We here propose to design a more integrated data and modeling framework which facilitates an easier linkage between hydrological and ecological information and is geared towards hydro-ecological research, applications, and management. In conclusion and to widen the scope of routing, tracing, and connectivity in hydrological models, for this paper, we define the term ‘river network routing’ following the hydrological connectivity concept of Pringle (2003) as ‘the simulation of movement of energy, material and species within a hydrological object space, based on flow routing, tracing and in-stream processing.’",
        "In response, we proposed a versatile global hydrological modeling framework that addresses these limitations, providing support for a broad range of applications."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "Despite significant recent advancements, global hydrological models and their input databases still show limited capabilities in supporting many spatially detailed research questions and integrated assessments, such as required in freshwater ecology or applied water resources management. The current spatial resolution of GHMs is not appropriate for many ecological or environmental management applications because of difficulties to accurately represent stream and watershed attributes and to precisely locate individual objects within the river system. The relatively coarse spatial resolution introduces bias and misrepresentation of hydrological processes and river topology. This can result, for example, in underestimation of river length and travel times and can lead to subsequent inaccuracies of travel-based attributes, e.g., sediment delivery to the ocean. The integration of local or fine-scale information is difficult, if not impossible.",
        "A major limitation of the raster concept, however, is the difficulty to integrate objects or information from different sources or formats (such as the discharge time series of a gauging station; a reservoir outline; or a fish migration route) into one common framework, as linkages would have to be established to individual pixels. Yet, difficulties arise from inherent data and modeling characteristics. For example, certain types of geospatial hydrological data, such as runoff coefficients or flow directions, cannot be easily scaled by spatial resampling techniques. We are currently not aware of models that can fully implement such advanced up- and downstream routing in a global framework. Thus, for the primary goal of a first-level integration of baseline hydrology with ecological and other applications at the global scale, we believe that the full implementation of hydrodynamic processes, though desirable, is currently not a stringent priority.",

In nearly all GHMs, the implemented routing models operate on raster data. Only recently, some large-scale models started to shift towards a vector environment (e.g. Paiva et al., 2011) or use advanced sub-grid and/or hybrid structures (e.g. Yamazaki et al., 2011)."

        "水是维持地球生命的必要条件，许多地球系统过程依赖于淡水资源的空间和时间分布。水文循环及其基础物理过程在过去几十年中得到了深入研究，主要集中在小到中型流域。然而，近年来，由于来自多种复杂和相互作用因素的压力不断增加，淡水资源的重要性得到了越来越多的关注，这些因素跨越了所有尺度。因此，越来越认识到大型河流系统的重要性。由于在大空间和时间尺度上对许多水文变量进行现场测量既困难又昂贵，全球水文模型（GHMs）已成为我们分析当前和未来世界水资源的首选研究工具。尽管关注度增加，但在大尺度上的水文建模传统上受到许多问题的制约，包括我们对地球许多地区基础过程的知识和理解的普遍局限性；数据收集的不完整、不一致或高度不确定性；模型与数据集之间缺乏空间整合；以及创建支持多尺度或耦合方法的模型的困难。为了实现这一目标，需要新的和增强的全球数据集和工具，以描述水文特征、特性和过程的地理分布，因为这些信息目前往往不可用或质量较低。",

        "然而，栅格概念的一个主要局限性是将来自不同来源或格式的信息（例如，测流站的排水时间序列、一个水库的轮廓或鱼类迁徙路线）整合到一个共同框架中的困难，因为必须将链接建立到单个像素。然而，由于固有的数据和建模特性，困难随之而来。例如，某些类型的地理空间水文数据，如径流系数或流向，无法通过空间重采样技术轻易缩放。目前我们尚未发现能够在全球框架内完全实现这种先进的上下游水流路由的模型。因此，对于将基线水文学与生态和其他应用在全球范围内进行初步整合的主要目标而言，尽管全面实施水动力过程是可取的，但目前并不是一个严格的优先事项。",
