All variable names and units were processed according to the “LS4P_ESM_outputs_list_update” through NCL and CDO software and all data has been remapped into regular lat./lon grid.",
            "instructions": "According to \"guideline_for_data_uploading\", all data files were named in the format \"VariableName_LS4P_CWRF_LS4PExperimentName_Frequency_[StartTime-EndTime].nc\" with the NETCDF format version4. In detail, VariableName could be found in “LS4P_ESM_outputs_list_update”. LS4PExperimentName identifies the experiment name [Task 1], [Task 2],  [Task 3] and [Task4]. Frequency is the output frequency indicator: 3hr=3hourly, 6hr=6hourly, day=daily, mon=monthly.
