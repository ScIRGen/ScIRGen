                    "Answer": "'多年冻土发生概率' refers to the probability of permafrost occurrence, which is a measure or estimation used to indicate the likelihood of permafrost existing in a particular area within the dataset. This is achieved by integrating ground observations with various remote sensing data products using statistical learning models to simulate and estimate permafrost conditions over a specified period, in this case, from 2000 to 2016, across the Northern Hemisphere.",

                    "Answer": "Ground-based observations provide detailed annual mean ground temperature and active layer thickness data from numerous sites, while multi-source remote sensing data allows for the integration and simulation of these variables over a wider area with a 1-kilometer spatial resolution. The integration of both methods through statistical learning models results in higher accuracy for datasets representing permafrost conditions from 2000 to 2016, allowing for comprehensive environmental modeling and assessment.",

This approach improves the precision of annual mean ground temperature, active layer thickness, permafrost occurrence probability, and hydrothermal zonation data, benefiting engineering planning, environmental simulations, and evaluations.",
