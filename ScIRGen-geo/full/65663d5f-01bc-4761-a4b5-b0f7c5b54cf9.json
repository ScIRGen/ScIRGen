            "description": "We focused on glacial lakes with areas ≥ 0.02 km2 that were primarily fed by contemporary glacier meltwater within a 10 km glacier buffer. Numerous thermokarst lakes and lakes without parent glaciers were excluded. Three time windows, 2018, 2020, and 2022, were selected to create new inventories and were combined with other available datasets to reveal the short-term and long-term glacial lake changes. A total of 878 Sentinel-2A/B images (10-m resolution) were used to manually delineate the glacial lakes. To ensure a sufficient storage period for the glacial lakes during the year and to minimize the presence of mountain shadows, priority was given to images captured between July and November with less than 10% cloud coverage. The images were processed using a false-color composition of bands 4, 3, and 2 to highlight the water bodies. Throughout the workflow, each glacial lake underwent thorough review at least six times, ensuring the inventory's completeness according to our standards.",

                    "Answer": "Sentinel-2A/B imagery refers to a type of satellite imagery used for manually delineating glacier lakes within a dataset. It involves using 878 images at a 10-meter resolution, specifically choosing those with less than 10% cloud coverage between July and November to ensure sufficient storage period for glacier lakes and minimize the presence of mountain shadows.

                    "Answer": "The method described utilizes 878 Sentinel-2A/B images with a 10-meter resolution to manually delineate glacier lakes, prioritizing images with less than 10% cloud cover between July and November to ensure sufficient storage time and minimize mountain shadows. This approach involves a detailed review process where each lake is analyzed at least six times for completeness. It focuses on glacier lakes with contemporary glacial meltwater sources, excluding thermokarst lakes and precipitation-fed lakes, enabling a specific analysis of glacier-fed lakes over selected time windows (2018, 2020, and 2022) to reveal both short-term and long-term changes.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of images with less than 10% cloud cover between July and November indicates an emphasis on capturing glacier lakes during periods when they are most visible and accessible for analysis, minimizing interference from cloud cover and shadows. This suggests that glacier lakes have a sufficient storage period during these months, potentially reflecting seasonal melting patterns and environmental conditions favorable for observing water bodies without obstructions.",

                    "Answer": "Using Sentinel-2A/B imagery with less than 10% cloud coverage allows for more accurate and complete manual delineation of glacier lakes by minimizing obstructions in the images. It helps ensure that glacier lakes are observed during their adequate storage periods, reducing errors caused by cloud cover and mountain shadow, thus enhancing the accuracy and completeness of the glacier lake inventory.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives include assessing the risk associated with glacier lakes by focusing on those with significant influence from contemporary glacier meltwater within a 10 km buffer zone, and excluding lakes primarily fed by permafrost melt or precipitation. By analyzing data from selected years and integrating other available datasets, the aim is to reveal short-term and long-term changes in glacier lakes, ensuring comprehensive risk evaluation and identification of significant indicators through meticulous image analysis and review.",
