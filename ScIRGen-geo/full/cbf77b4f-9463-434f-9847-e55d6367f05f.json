            "description": "This data is the whole rock Ca-Sr-Nd isotopic geochemical data of the Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (N-MORB) from the South Juan de Fuka Ridge. The samples are fresh basalt glass with less than 2% phenocrysts from Cleft Segment and Axial Volcano of the  Southern Juan de Fuca Ridge. The Ca isotopic composition of the whole rock was obtained by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). The whole rock Sr-Nd isotopes were analyzed by Multi-Colletor inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer  (MC-ICP-MS). The above data have been published in the international famous SCI Journal (Journal of geophysical research: solid earth), and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can understand the Ca isotopic composition of N-MORB and constrain the fractionation of Ca isotope during partial melting.",

These techniques are utilized to ensure high precision and reliability in the isotope measurements. TIMS and MC-ICP-MS are known for their accuracy in isotope ratio determination, which is crucial for understanding the fractionation of Ca isotopes during partial melting processes. Challenges such as maintaining the pristine condition of basalt glass samples, which have phenocryst contents of less than 2%, are addressed by selecting fresh samples from specific ridge blocks and volcanic axes to minimize contamination and alteration effects.",
