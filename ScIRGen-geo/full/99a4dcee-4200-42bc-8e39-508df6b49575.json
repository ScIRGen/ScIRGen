Spectrum of the maize field quadrate and desert scrub quadrate in Wulidun farmland (May 25, 28, 30, Jun. 29 and Jul. 11), the desert transit zone strip (May 28 and 30) and Linze station quadrates (Jun. 25, 30 and Jul. 9) was measured by ASD Spectroradiometer (350～2 500 nm) from BNU, the reference board (40% before Jun. 15 and 20% hereafter), two observation platforms of BNU make and one of Institute of Remote Sensing Applications make. Raw spectral data were archived as binary files, which were recorded daily in detail, and pre-processed data on reflectance and transmittivity were archived as text files (.txt).\n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",

                    "Answer": "Multi-angle observation frames, as used in the dataset, provide a more comprehensive view of the spectral characteristics by capturing data from multiple angles, which can enhance the understanding of anisotropic surface features. Single-angle techniques may not capture this variability as effectively. The data collection involved multiple observation frames from different institutions, allowing for a broader range of data capture in various environments such as cornfields and desert shrublands.",

The data collection occurs in areas like agricultural plots and desert transition zones, targeting objects like cornfields and desert shrubs. The data is initially collected in binary format by the spectrometer and can be opened with ViewSpecPro software. Preprocessing involves converting the raw binary data into reflectance data in text format, with detailed observation records maintained daily.",
