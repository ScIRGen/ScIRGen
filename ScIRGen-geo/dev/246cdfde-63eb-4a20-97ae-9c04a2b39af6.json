            "description": "Soil moisture is an important state variable in the terrestrial water cycle and plays an important role in the study of land-atmosphere interactions, regional hydrological processes, and water resource management. Microwave remote sensing is an effective method for soil moisture monitoring and has many advantages, such as high sensitivity to soil moisture, all-weather observation capability, large spatial coverage, and frequent revisits. However, the global soil moisture datasets produced from satellite-based microwave observations usually suffer from gaps due to the satellite orbits, environmental factors, and retrieval algorithms, and these gaps affect their further applications in global climate change and hydrological process analysis. To solve this problem, we proposed a gap-filling method by applying the machine learning (Random Forest) algorithm in a pixel-by-pixel manner to reconstruct global surface soil moisture products, taking into account the nonlinear relationship between surface soil moisture and the related surface environmental variables. The gap-filling method was applied to the long-term global daily soil moisture dataset derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 (NN-SM) (https://doi.org/10.11888/Soil.tpdc.270960), and a global daily gap-free surface soil moisture dataset from 2002 to 2020 was then generated accordingly. The accuracy of the reconstructed surface soil moisture dataset was evaluated using in situ surface soil moisture observations from sites in the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network, and good accuracy was indicated with an ubRMSE of 0.051 m3/m3. Overall, the reconstructed surface soil moisture dataset retained the good characteristics of the original NN-SM product, such as high accuracy and reliable spatiotemporal pattern, while having the advantage of continuous spatiotemporal coverage, which makes it more suitable for further applications in the analysis of global surface soil moisture trends, land surface hydrological processes, and land-atmosphere energy and water exchanges, etc.",
            "instructions": "The dataset contains surface soil moisture and data flags, stored in geotiff format. The file name of soil moisture data is “reconstructed_sm_yyyydoy.tif”, where yyyy represents the year and ddd represents the Julian date. For example, “reconstructed_sm_2004001.tif” represents the global soil moisture distribution on the first day of 2004, and the corresponding file name of data flags is “reconstructed_sm_yyyydoy_flag.tif”. The data flags are as follows: “0” represents the original value of surface soil moisture from NN-SM; “1” represents the gap-filled value of surface soil moisture; “2” represents the pixels covered by water or snow/ice, and frozen soils. Data reading method: The data can be read by any software or computer language that can read geotiff format, such as ArcGIS, ENVI, IDL, Matlab and so on.",

                "Soil moisture (SM) is considered as one of the most important factors in hydrology, ecology, meteorology, and soil science. Soil moisture data are mainly obtained by three methods: in situ observations, land surface model simulations, and satellite remote sensing observations. In recent years, with the continuous development of space technology, satellite remote sensing observation has become one of the most important means to obtain SM products for use at regional and global scales. The remote sensing-based SM is usually referred to as the volumetric soil water content in the surface layer (generally with depth less than 5 cm), hereafter referred to as surface soil moisture (SSM) in this study. Previous studies have shown that the surface soil moisture product from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is currently the most accurate with ubRMSE close to 0.04 m3/m3. However, it has relatively short temporal coverage, i.e., from 2015 to present. Efforts have been made to improve the accuracy and the temporal coverage of remote sensing surface soil moisture by fusing different satellite data. However, due to the impacts of the satellite orbit, radio frequency interference, vegetation interference, presence of ice, and snow or frozen ground, the acquired surface soil moisture products always have gaps in many areas. Therefore, an effective strategy to reconstruct the missing data in the surface soil moisture product is required to improve the spatiotemporal integrity of the SM products."

                "Considering the critical role of spatio-temporally continuous surface soil moisture data and the capability of the machine learning method, this study attempts to generate a long-term surface soil moisture dataset at the global scale with spatiotemporal continuity. The main objectives are: (1) to develop a surface soil moisture reconstruction model using the Random Forest algorithm based on the correlation between surface soil moisture and various influencing factors of multiple surface environmental variables; (2) to generate a global spatiotemporal continuous daily gap-free surface soil moisture dataset from 2002 to 2020 by reconstructing the missing soil moisture data in the NN-SM product; (3) to demonstrate the reliability of the reconstructed gap-free surface soil moisture product by comparison with in situ observations."

                "However, soil moisture products produced from satellite observations have data gaps due to the limited capabilities of satellite orbit/swath and retrieval algorithms, which limit the regional and global applications of soil moisture data in hydrology and agriculture studies. The fractional number of valid observations in GDSMFD is 67.2%, and the fractional number of valid observations was low in high-altitude and high-latitude regions. This phenomenon makes it difficult to achieve spatial continuity in these surface soil moisture datasets and greatly hinders subsequent applications. Furthermore, the data gaps vary with time and locations, making it difficult to analyze surface soil moisture characteristics in specific regions and time periods."
