Reflectance could be got based on R = (DN1/DN0)×R0, DN1 indicating DN of the item, R0 and DN0 the reflectance and DN of the grey board.\n     Synchronizing with WiDAS and OMIS-II, the ground observations on reflectance (-60°~60° at intervals of 10°) of maize and wheat were carried out with ASD (FOV: 25°) and the self-made observation platform (maximum height: 5m) on May 30, Jun. 9, 14, 20, 22, 26 and 30, and Jul. 1, 2008. \n     Raw data, recorded data and processed BRDF were archived in Excel format.",

                "Land surface albedo is a very important parameter, which can be derived from a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model with angular integration of BRDF in a particular distribution of downward solar irradiance. The Algorithm for MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Anisotropic of Land Surface (AMBRALS) utilizes a kernel-driven BRDF model to retrieve land surface albedo, but it does not take into account the topographic effect. Land surface albedo frequently served as an indicator to quantify how much energy the Earth receives from the sun. The Algorithm for MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Anisotropic of Land Surface (AMBRALS) is an algorithm designed for land surface albedo retrieval using NASA’s MODIS data. This algorithm has been widely accepted, but it cannot deal with topographic effect, which leads to large uncertainties in albedo retrieval over rugged terrain. The topography plays different roles in the retrieval of land surface albedo at different spatial scales. At high spatial resolution, topography results in multiscattering among pixels and varies the downward solar irradiance. At low spatial resolution, topography leads to multiscattering and obscuration within pixel. In a 30 m grid, the topography modifies the solar reflecting geometry and influences land surface albedo in several ways: 1) varying the downward direct solar radiance; 2) affecting downward diffuse radiance; and 3) modifying the reflected radiance due to non-flat surface."

To overcome this shortage, we attempt to introduce a topographic factor into the AMBRALS to deal with topographic effect. A hypothesis is made that a digital elevation model (DEM) with horizontal resolution of 30 m could fully capture the topographic characteristics."

However, the method did not consider the correction on land surface reflectance in obstructed pixels; this work will be processed in further study."
