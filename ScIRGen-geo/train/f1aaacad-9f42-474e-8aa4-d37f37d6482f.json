The data name is GLC2000.GLC2000 China's regional land cover data is directly cropped from global cover data. For data description, please refer to http : //www-gvm.jrc.it/glc2000/defaultGLC2000.htm\n2) igbp_lucc_1km_China.asc, a Chinese subset of global land cover data based on AVHRR remote sensing data supported by IGBP-DIS, the data name is IGBPDIS; IGBPDIS data was prepared using the USGS method, using April 1992 to March 1992 The AVHRR data developed global land cover data with a resolution of 1km. The classification system adopts a classification system developed by IGBP, which divides the world into 17 categories. Its development is based on continents. Applying AVHRR for 12 months to maximize synthetic NDVI data,\n3) modis_lucc_1km_China_2001.asc, a subset of MODIS land cover data products in China, the data name is MODIS; MODIS China's regional land cover data is directly cropped from global cover data, and its data description please refer to http://edcdaac.usgs.gov/ modis / mod12q1v4.asp.\n4. umd_lucc_1km_China.asc, a Chinese subset of global land cover data based on AVHRR data produced by the University of Maryland, the data name is UMd; the five bands of UMd based on AVHRR data and NDVI data are recombined to suggest a data matrix, using Methodology carried out global land cover classification. The goal is to create data that is more accurate than past data. The classification system largely adopts the classification scheme of IGBP.\n5) westdc_lucc_1km_China.asc, China ’s 2000: 100,000 land cover data organized and implemented by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, combined with Yazashi conversion (the largest area method), and finally obtained a land use data product of 1km across the country, data name WESTDC. WESTDC China's regional land cover data is based on the results of a 1: 100,000 county-level land resource survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The land use data were merged and converted into a vector (the largest area method). The Chinese Academy of Sciences resource and environment classification system is adopted.\n2: Data format: ArcView GIS ASCII\n3: Mesh parameters:\n      ncols 4857\n      nrows 4045\n      xllcorner -2650000\n      yllcorner 1876946\n      cellsize 1000\n      NODATA_value -9999\n4: Projection parameters:\n      Projection ALBERS\n      Units METERS\n      Spheroid Krasovsky\n      Parameters:\n      25 00 0.000 / * 1st standard parallel\n      47 00 0.000 / * 2nd standard parallel\n      105 00 0.000 / * central meridian\n      0 0 0.000 / * latitude of projection's origin\n      0.00000 / * false easting (meters)\n      0.00000 / * false northing (meters)",
