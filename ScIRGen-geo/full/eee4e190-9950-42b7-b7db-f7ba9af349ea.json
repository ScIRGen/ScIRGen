            "description": "The soil in Nanfeng area is closely related to its natural conditions, and there are various soil types. According to soil forming factors, soil forming process and its property characteristics, soil can be divided into the following 8 main types, and their property characteristics are described in Table 1. The profile NZS is collected on the western slope of the namula mountain pass in Pai District, Milin County, with an altitude of about 4700 meters and a slope of 10 °. The parent material of the soil is moraine (gneiss), and alpine meadow plants grow. The profile NZS is taken as an example to describe the profile configuration of alpine meadow soil, as shown in Table 2. The profile en is collected at 3750m south of the Galongla mountain pass. The parent material of the soil is granodiorite slope deposit with a slope of about 30 °, and the plants are various shrubs and herbs. The profile morphological characteristics of subalpine shrub meadow soil are described in Table 3 with profile en as an example. The original data of this data set is digitized from the book \"natural geography and natural resources of the namgyabawa peak area\".",

For instance, soil types range from those formed on glacial deposits like gneiss to those on granite colluvium. These variations affect data collection methods as they necessitate different sampling techniques and analysis methods to accurately characterize the diverse soil profiles and their physicochemical properties.",
