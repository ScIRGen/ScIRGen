The C-band scatterometer was used specifically for polarizations such as VV, HH, VH, and HV in grassland and corn fields, whereas the S-band is mentioned without specific polarization details. Both scatterometers were used in conjunction with TDR soil moisture measurement instruments, but the C-band data collection also synchronized with ASAR satellite data at specific times, offering a more comprehensive data set for certain conditions.",

Measurements taken at different times, such as 11:30 AM when synchronized with ASAR, versus early morning at 7:30 AM when air humidity and dew might be higher, suggest that temporal factors and environmental conditions influence the backscatter response. This could imply that soil moisture readings are affected by the time of day and atmospheric conditions, potentially providing insight into optimal measurement times for accurate soil moisture assessment.",

This allows for a better understanding of the relationship between microwave backscatter and environmental variables, which is crucial for improving remote sensing models and applications.",

Additionally, timing of measurements, such as taking readings at 11:30 AM and considering factors like air humidity and dew presence, are crucial for accuracy. Soil moisture is measured with TDR soil moisture measurement instruments, identified as TDR-200, and observations are made in a north-south direction for grasslands and transverse for cornfields.",
