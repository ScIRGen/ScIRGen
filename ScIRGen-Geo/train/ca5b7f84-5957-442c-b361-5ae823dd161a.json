      "description": "This data is the distribution data of the prehistoric era sites on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas, which is derived from the Supplementary Maps of the paper: Chen, F.H., Dong, G.H., Zhang, D.J., Liu, X.Y., Jia, X., An, C.B., Ma, M.M., Xie, Y.W., Barton, L., Ren, X.Y., Zhao, Z.J., & Wu, X.H. (2015). Agriculture facilitated permanent human occupation of the Tibetan Plateau after 3600 BP. SCIENCE, 347, 248-250.\nThe Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with an average altitude of more than 4000m, is the highestand largest plateau all around the world, and also is one of the most unsuitable areas for human life with long-term on the earth. The remains at the archaeological site are direct evidences left behind the ancient human activities. The original data of this data is digitized from the results of \nthe Qinghai-Tibet Plateau high-textual census and archaeological survey (Qinghai Volume and Tibet Volume of the Chinese Cultural Relics Atlas). The map was digitized mainly based on the distribution maps of the sites, and the latitude and longitude coordinates and altitude were obtained. a total of 6,950 sites, most of which are distributed in the northern part of the plateau. The age range of the site is between 7000BP and 2300BP. This data set is of reference value for the research on the process and power of human diffusion to the Tibetan Plateau in the prehistoric era and other studies related to human activities in the Tibetan Plateau and the prehistoric era.",

        "Ecological factors can place heavy constraints on humans, particularly in areas of high altitude, because even small changes in temperature, precipitation, and land cover can have a major effect on what crops can be grown. Early studies of the mechanisms underlying the spread of wheat and barley considered a single aspect of crop growth patterns: length of the growing season. In particular, models based on a crop’s accumulated heat requirements—growing degree days (GDD)—predict that wheat and barley are more adapted to growth in high-latitude and high-altitude Eurasia than millets. Local ecology and climate, coupled with crop phenology, thus had a marked impact on crop adoption in high-altitude environments, one that differed substantially from the lowlands."

        "We contend that this argument is incompatible with the growing requirements of barley. It is necessary to clearly define past crop niches to create better models for the complex history of the occupation of the plateau. Examination of the thermal niche occupied by barley on the NETP shows that growing barley at an altitude of 4000 m above sea level—aclaimmadeinChenetal. was unlikely to have been successful in the average year."

        "The potential for both hunter-gatherers and pastoralists to move grains outside of the cultivated niche means that caution should be exercised when discussing when and where agriculture was carried out on the Tibetan Plateau and with what permanence it was occupied. Disentangling how agricultural crops and pastoral animals spread onto and across the Tibetan Plateau requires not only better evidence and robust models upon which this evidence may be brought to bear but also more complex narratives to interpret the mismatch between archaeological data and models for human behavior."
