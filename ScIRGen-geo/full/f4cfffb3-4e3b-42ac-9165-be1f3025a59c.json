            "description": "This data set comprises several great achievements of vertebrate paleontology of Tibetan Plateau in the Recent three years. Wang et al. (2016) reported Protovis himalayensis gen. et sp. nov., suggest that the Tibetan Plateau, possibly including Tianshan-Altai, represents the ancestral home range(s) of mountain sheep and that these basal stocks were the ultimate source of all extant species. Li et al. (2017) reported two new hamster species: Nannocricetus qiui and Aepyocricetus liui, indicated that the dispersal of these hamsters into the high-elevation portions of Tibet during the early Pliocene contrasts with the hypothesized biogeographic shift of several large mammal lineages out of Tibet. Wu et al. (2017) reported Eoanabas thibetana  gen. et sp. nov., suggests an elevation of North Tibet in late Oligocene was ca. 1,000 m, conﬂict with conclusions of a high and dry Tibet claimed by some recent and inﬂuential palaeoaltimetry studies. The data is from pictures of materials of research achievement above. These lead research on Tibetan Plateau to some new ways.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for studying ancient vertebrate fossils in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau focus on identifying new genera and species, such as the discovery of new genera and species of mountain sheep, hamsters, and climbing perch. These findings suggest unique evolutionary insights specific to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, potentially due to its historical and ecological context. In contrast, methods used in other high-altitude regions like the Andes or the Rocky Mountains may focus on different species and evolutionary patterns due to varying environmental and ecological conditions. For example, the Andes might emphasize the study of species adapted to different climatic conditions compared to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has its own unique climatic and geological history.",

                    "Answer": "The discoveries of new genera and species, such as the Himalayan primitive sheep and new hamster species, suggest that the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may have been a significant evolutionary origin site for mountain sheep and that hamsters spread to high-altitude regions during the Pliocene. These findings challenge the mainstream view of the plateau as a high-altitude arid region, indicating it might have been a more diverse and dynamic environment in the past.",

                    "Answer": "The discovery of new ancient vertebrate species such as the Himalayan argali, new hamster species, and the Tibetan climbing perch might be attributed to the unique geological and ecological conditions of the Tibetan Plateau. These conditions suggest that the region could have been an early origin point for certain species, potentially providing a habitat for primitive ancestors of modern species. These findings challenge mainstream views of the region's historical environment.",

This could indicate these primitive groups are the closest ancestors of modern sheep, offering new insights into the evolutionary history of these species and challenging existing theories about their origins.",

These objectives drive the collection of images and data that challenge existing theories, such as the high-altitude spread of mammals, and help redefine the understanding of historical climate and geography, such as the lower elevation of the northern Tibetan region in the late Oligocene.",
