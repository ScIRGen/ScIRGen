                "Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML) based on a set of artificial neural networks, has been widely explored to enhance the representation of the raw inputs that are significant for discrimination in many scientific disciplines. Due to the limitations in pattern recognition of high-dimensional raw data by universal approximator models in ML, DL enhances the capacity for modeling non-linear problems with multi-layered artificial neural networks. As a result, DL has been widely applied in uncovering complex relationships in many fields with large multivariate, inhomogeneous datasets. Land surface variables (LSVs), such as soil moisture, land surface temperature and latent and sensible heat fluxes, are identified as an important component of the Essential Climate Variables by the Global Observing System for Climate. The prediction of LSVs holds great significance in Earth system science as it helps to anticipate and comprehend the complexities of our real world. In the last decades, many researchers have tried to measure this issue based on process-based models such as land surface models, hydrology models and Earth system models, which utilize governing equations to capture the complex mechanisms of land–atmosphere feedbacks. Although process-based models have been successful in recent researches, they still have limitations for many practical applications, such as underrepresentation of key processes and human activities, high computational costs, a large range of predictions from different models, and low skill in predicting the extremes."

Furthermore, the LSTM model outperformed the other models in predicting both variables at 1- and 5-day lead time. Additionally, we noted that extending the LSTM model’s timestep from 7 to 365 enhanced its predictive performance, yielding higher R values and lower RMSE values for soil moisture at 1- and 5-day lead times, and for surface sensible heat fluxes at a 5-day lead time. The LSTM model with 365 timesteps outperformed the processed-based model, exhibiting higher R and lower RMSE for both lead times at all resolutions."
