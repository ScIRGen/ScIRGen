            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jul. 11, 2008.\n    The data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 11:26 BJT. Observations were carried out in the reed plot A, the saline plots B and C, the alfalfa plot D and the barley plot E, which were divided into 6×6 subsites, with each one spanning a 120×120 m2 plot. Soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by using the cutting ring, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, and the canopy temperature and the land surface temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer were measured in A, B and C; the soil temperature, soil moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the canopy temperature and the land surface temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer in D and E.\n    Data were archived in Excel file. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",

In the context of remote sensing experiments, such as the one conducted in the Linze grassland intensive observation area, this involves collecting ground data on variables like soil moisture using various methods, such as ring knife soil sampling and sensors, at the same time as satellite radar data like Envisat ASAR is collected. This synchrony helps in developing and validating algorithms for remote sensing data interpretation.",

This is crucial due to the variability in soil properties and environmental conditions that can affect remote sensing data accuracy. By conducting observations on the ground simultaneously with satellite overpasses, researchers can ensure that the satellite data is accurately calibrated and validated against real-world conditions.",
