            "description": "This data set includes the data of major and trace elements of whole rock, major and trace elements of minerals, whole rock SR – Nd isotopes and zircon u – Pb ages of gabbros and their enclaves. The samples were collected from gabbros and xenoliths in dajiacuo area, Lhasa block, southern Tibet. Zircon U-Pb dating data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data of major elements in minerals are obtained by electron probe analysis, and the data of trace elements in minerals are obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The whole rock SR – Nd isotopes were obtained by sample separation and purification multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Through the data obtained, we can define the age, origin and deep dynamic mechanism of magmatism in the region, and provide an understanding of amphibole differentiation process of arc magma.",
