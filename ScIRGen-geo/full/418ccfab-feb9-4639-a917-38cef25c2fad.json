            "description": "1. Data content:  0.25° resolution snow depth and snow water equivalent product of the Asian Water Tower Region from August 2012 to July 2020. Spatial coverage: 70-105°E, 25-50°N. Temporal resolution: daily. Spatial resolution: 0.25°.\n2. Data source and processing method: 0.25° resolution snow depth of the Asian Water Tower region is extracted from the physical snow process model supported global snow depth product retrieved from the passive microwave AMSR2 sensor (Pan et al., 2023). Using the high resolution (3 km) snow depth retrieved from optical and passive microwave observations based on physical theories as the reference dataset, the global product in Asian Water Tower region is reprocessed by doing intercalibrations pixel by pixel in 0.25° scale. Afterward, the calibrated snow depth is converted to snow water equivalent using annual average snow density calculated for each pixel using SNTHERM（Snow Thermal Model）model.\n3. Data quality description: At 3 km scale, the consistency between the ground station observed snow depth and the reference dataset in the 2019-2020 snow year is 10 cm root-mean-squared error (RMSE) in 0-120 cm range. After converted to 0.25° scale, the correlation between the reference dataset and the newly-generated adjusted snow depth product is 0.79.\n4. Data application potential: Snow study for the Asian Water Tower region.",

This correction at a 0.25° resolution scale aimed to enhance data accuracy using the physical mechanism inversion. The high-resolution data provided a key reference, and the correction was necessary to align the dataset more closely with observed values, as evidenced by a correlation coefficient of 0.79 with the newly generated corrected snow depth.",

In the provided field, the high-resolution (3km) snow depth data served as reference values, resulting in a corrected dataset with a correlation coefficient of 0.79 when compared to the original data. This suggests that the correction enhances the reliability and precision of snow depth measurements, which is crucial for accurate snow-related research and applications in the Asian Water Tower region.",
