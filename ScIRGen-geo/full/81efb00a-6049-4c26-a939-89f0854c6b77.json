            "description": "The Tibet Plateau (TP) is the highest and youngest plateau in the world and one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change. The lake areas in the TP account for more than half of China’s total lake area, so it is of great significance to obtain the lake distribution in the TP for the study of climate and environmental change in the Tibetan Plateau. Most previous studies focused on obtaining the data of lakes larger than 1km2, but the number of small lakes distributed on the TP is much larger than that of larger lakes, and small lakes are more active in global ecosystems than large lakes and terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In order to obtain lakes larger than 0.01km2 on the entire TP, all TP lakes from 2016 to 2021 were extracted using D-LinkNet based on Sentinel-1 SAR data. The lake dataset shows an area accuracy of 86.49% in different regions. The lake dataset can be mainly used for the study of lake variation, lake water balance and climate change in the Tibet Plateau. The data type of the lakes dataset is vector data, the attribute field includes Area (km2), and the projection is WGS84.",

The lake areas in the TP account for more than half of China’s total lake area. Previous studies have indicated that most lakes in the TP have expanded over the past few decades, although lakes in the southern TP have been shrinking. Precipitation is the dominant factor driving lake changes in the TP (approximately 70%), and the trend of lake expansion may be driven by the wetting of the TP. Moreover, variations in lakes on the TP may have been driven by changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation, and lakes may have a response mechanism to strong climate change. For example, there were inflection points in 1997 and 2015, when lake changes were affected by the El Niño phenomenon, after which the lake continued to expand. Numerous lakes distributed on the TP provide feedback on global climate change, which may further influence the regional environment and climate. Small lakes play an important role in the global ecosystem. Emerging research has shown that small lakes are more active than large lakes and terrestrial and marine ecosystems in almost every process. The number of small lakes distributed on the TP is much larger than the number of larger lakes. In particular, glacial lakes developed in the Himalayas may have higher climate sensitivity and risk levels."
