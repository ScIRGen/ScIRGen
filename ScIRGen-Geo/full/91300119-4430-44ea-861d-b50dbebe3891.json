        "Precipitation in the basin is mainly controlled by the Indian summer monsoon and westerly and is the key to understanding the water resources available in the basin; however, due to sparse observational data constrained by a harsh environment and complex topography, there remains a lack of reliable information on basin-wide precipitation (there are only nine national meteorological stations with continuous observations). The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the highest plateau in the world, is covered by massive glaciers, snow, and permafrost, which significantly affect the hydrological processes of all the large rivers that are fed by it: the Brahmaputra, the Salween, and the Mekong, among others. However, due to the irregular and sparse distribution of national meteorological stations, particularly in the upper Brahmaputra (precipitation data from only nine stations are available and are sparsely distributed), there are large data constraints on research on these hydrological processes and their responses to climate change. Although there are many more rain gauges managed by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), most of them are located in middle-stream regions, and rainfall datasets are only recorded over short time periods. Accurate spatial distributions of precipitation are unavailable. Most studies have focused on evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and groundwater products derived from GLDAS or MERRA2; meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, there has been less focus on the evaluation of methods of precipitation estimation and little work on the corresponding river discharge simulations within the upper Brahmaputra River basin. These precipitation products generally have the advantage of wide and consistent coverage and have shown great potential in many applications but also suffer from large uncertainties over the upper Brahmaputra River basin due to indirect observations, insufficient gauge calibration, and complex topography."
