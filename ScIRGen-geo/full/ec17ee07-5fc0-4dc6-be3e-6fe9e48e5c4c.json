            "description": "The dataset contains the observation data of the 10m tower automatic weather station on January 13, 2014 at solstice on December 31, 2014.The station is located in east garden town, huailai county, hebei province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7880E, 40.3491N, and the altitude is 480m.\nThe automatic weather station is installed on a 10m tower, the acquisition frequency is 30s, and the output time is 10min.The observation factors include air temperature and relative humidity (5m), and the direction is due north.The wind speed (10m), the wind direction (10m), the direction is due to the north;Air pressure (installed in waterproof box);Rainfall (10m);The four-component radiation (5m), the direction is due to the south;The infrared surface temperature (5m), the arm is facing south, and the probe is facing vertically downward.The soil temperature and humidity probe was buried 1.5m south of the meteorological tower. The soil temperature probe was buried at a depth of 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm. The soil moisture sensor was buried at a depth of 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm.The average soil temperature was buried 2,4 cm underground.Soil hot flow plates (3) are buried in the ground 6cm.Processing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) eliminate the moments with duplicate records;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the format of date and time is unified, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2014-6-10-10:30.January 13 - March 26 due to probe problems, soil moisture data at a depth of 20cm was wrong;From January 21 to March 26, due to probe problems, soil moisture data at a depth of 120cm was wrong;From March 17 to March 26 due to probe problems, soil moisture data at depth of 2,4,10,20 cm were wrong.The soil heat flux G2 had a problem on June 16, BBB 0, July 9 due to the hot plate problem.\nGuo et al, 2020 is used for site introduction and Liu et al, 2013 for data processing",

Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness only on the order of tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS can better match the pixel scale of satellite imagery and the grid scale of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth for the pixel/grid scale of remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the observed atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."

                    "Answer": "Datasets related to aerodynamic roughness length (z0m) over heterogeneous surfaces can be expanded or refined by incorporating additional data from experimental studies that calculate z0m using characteristic parameters of roughness elements like vegetation height and leaf area index. The aggregation of z0m over entire experimental fields using footprint weighting methods can provide more comprehensive data. Further research can focus on parameterizations that relate z0m to land surface properties and explore the direction-dependent nature of z0m due to varying roughness element sizes and distributions along different wind directions.",
