            "description": "This dataset is an upgraded version of \"China snow depth long time series data set (1978-2012)\". The long time series data set of snow depth in China (1979-2023) adopts longitude and latitude projection, and the data is floating-point. Data sets are stored by year. Each year is a compressed package, and each compressed package contains daily snow depth files. The daily snow depth is stored in a TXT file named \"yyyyddd.txt\", where yyyy stands for year, DDD stands for Julian date, and the unit of snow depth is cm. For example, 2005001 Txt represents this ASCII file to describe the snow cover in China on the first day of 2005. The ASCII code file of the data set is composed of a header file and the main content. The header file consists of 6 lines of description information, such as the number of rows, the number of columns, the coordinates of the x-axis center point, the y-axis center point, the grid size, and the label value of the no data area. The main content is a two-dimensional group composed of the number of rows and columns. The unit of snow depth is cm. Because the space described by all ASCII files in the data set is nationwide in China, the header files of these files are unchanged. Now the header files are excerpted as follows (where xllcenter, yllcenter and cellsize are in degrees): Ncols 321 Nrows 161 Xllcenter 60 Yllcenter 15 Cellsize 0.25 NoData_ Value -1.\nThis dataset was retrieved from the satellite-borne passive microwave brightness temperature data using the Chinese passive microwave snow depth inversion algorithm Che algorithm. The satellite-borne passive microwave brightness temperature data are from multiple sensors, and the sensors used in this data include SMMR on Nimbus7 (1979-1988), SSMI on DMSP-F08,F11,F13 (1988-2008), SSMI/S on DMSP-F17 (2009-2020), AMSR-E on Aqua (2002-2011), AMSR2 on GCOM-W1 (2012-2023). Considering the systematic differences between the different sensors, a cross-calibration of the different sensors has been carried out prior to the snow depth inversion.",

                    "Answer": "The Che algorithm is a snow depth retrieval method used to extract snow depth information from satellite-borne passive microwave brightness temperature data. It utilizes data from multiple sensors, including SMMR on Nimbus7, SSM/I on DMSP-F08, F11, F13, SSMI/S on DMSP-F17, AMSR-E on Aqua, and AMSR2 on GCOM-W1. The algorithm accounts for system differences between sensors through cross-correction prior to snow depth retrieval.",

                    "Answer": "The need for cross-calibration among sensors arises due to the system differences between the various sensors used, such as those on Nimbus7, DMSP-F08, F11, F13, and Aqua. These differences could affect the consistency and accuracy of snow depth extraction, necessitating adjustments to ensure comparable data across different time periods and sensor sources.",

                    "Answer": "Using multiple satellite sensors, such as SMMR, SSMI, SSMI/S, AMSR-E, and AMSR2, for snow depth data collection can result in inconsistencies due to system differences among sensors. These differences necessitate cross-correction to ensure consistency and accuracy. However, this approach allows for continuous data collection over an extended period, contributing to a comprehensive long-term dataset. Discrepancies between sensors, such as the noted difference in SSMI/S data post-2021, can impact the reliability of updated data, requiring careful calibration and validation processes.",

This dataset aims to accurately represent daily snow coverage and depth, facilitating climate and environmental studies. By employing the Che algorithm and data from multiple satellite sensors, the dataset seeks to overcome discrepancies between different sensor systems through cross-calibration, ensuring consistency and reliability over the long temporal span.",

The data is obtained from multiple sensors, including Nimbus7's SMMR, DMSP's SSMI and SSMI/S, Aqua's AMSR-E, and GCOM-W1's AMSR2. Before snow depth retrieval, cross-calibration is performed to correct for systematic differences across the sensors.",
