            "description": "Dasuo River Basin is the catchment area of Dasuo River. The basin is located in the north slope of central Himalaya and situated in Nyalam County, Tibet Autonomous Region, China. The Dasuo River originates from Dasuopu Glacier of Mount Xixabangma. It converges with Zedang River to form the Naduore River, which is the main tributaries in the upper reaches of Pengqu River. The geo-location of the Dasuo River Basin is 28°20'53\"-28°35'17\"N, 85°42'29″-85°48'50″E. The length and width of the Dasuo River Basin are 25 km and 8 km, respectively. The Dasuo River Basin has a total area of about 88.64 km² and the perimeter is 73.43 km. The elevation of the Dasuo River Basin ranges from 5006 m to 8027 m and the average elevation is 5909 m. Over three quarters of this region is above 5500 m. The dataset was developed based on the scale 1:100,000 topographic map, 12.5 m resolution DEM, Google Earth images, together with the field survey. The dataset is archived in .kmz and .shp data formats, and consists of 17 data files with 296 KB (Compressed into 2 files with 133 KB).",
