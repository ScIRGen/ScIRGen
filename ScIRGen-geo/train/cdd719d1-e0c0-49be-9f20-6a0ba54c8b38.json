            "description": "ChinaHighNO2 is one of the series of long-term, full-coverage, high-resolution, and high-quality datasets of ground-level air pollutants for China (i.e., ChinaHighAirPollutants, CHAP). It is generated from the big data (e.g., ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations) using artificial intelligence by considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of air pollution. This is the big data-derived seamless (spatial coverage = 100%) daily, monthly, and yearly 1 km (i.e., D1K, M1K, and Y1K) ground-level NO2 dataset in China from 2008 to present. Note that this dataset is 10 km before 2019, and improved to 1 km after 2019. This dataset yields a high quality with cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) values of 0.84 and 0.93, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of 7.99 and 4.89 µg m-3 for the daily retrievals for 10 km and 1 km data, respectively. Note that this dataset is continuously updated, and if you want to apply for more data or have any questions, please contact me (Email: weijing_rs@163.com; weijing@umd.edu).\nThe data file contains four codes (Python, Matlab, IDL and R language) nc2geotiff codes for NC to GeoTiff.",
