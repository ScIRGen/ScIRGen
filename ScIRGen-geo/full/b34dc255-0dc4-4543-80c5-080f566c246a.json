            "description": "The samples of this data set are from the modern river sand in Lhasa River and Nianchu River in  Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin and Pumchu collected by Hu Xiumian research group of Nanjing University in 2016; By extracting detrital zircon, monazite, titanite and rutile from the river sand, LA-MC-ICP-MS was performed to determine the trace elements and U-Th-Pb geochronology. The above tests were conducted by professionals at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing University and Trinity College, Ireland with high quality; The above data have been published in earth science review. Relative geochronological data from bedrock in these river basins were also collected for comparison.",

This is done to understand the provenance and geological history of the source areas within the river basins. The goal is to compare these data with existing geochronological data from bedrock in the same regions to provide insights into sediment transport and deposition processes.
