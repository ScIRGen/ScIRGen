                "Monitoring surface radiation budget by remote sensing technique is a very important use of satellite data. Especially for surface solar radiation (SSR), the earliest studies can date back to the 60s of the last century (Fritz, Rao, & Weinstein, 1964). Besides large and continuous spatio-temporal coverage, another main advantage of the satellite remote sensing technique over other approaches (e.g., discrete surface observation or reanalysis modelled products) is that it can accurately capture the spatial distributions and dynamic changes of cloud, which is regarded as a superior modulator of SSR (Forman & Margulis, 2009). Up to now, over decades of rapid development, estimation of SSR based on satellite remote sensing technique has become increasingly mature, and many products have already been produced (Liang, Wang, Zhang, & Wild, 2010; Pinker & Laszlo, 1992; Pinker et al., 2003; Posselt, Mueller, Stockli, & Trentmann, 2012; Zhang, Liang, Zhou, Wu, & Zhao, 2014; Zhang, Rossow, Lacis, Oinas, & Mishchenko, 2004).",
                "In general, the validation of products, whether at the kilometer-level or grid-level, is conducted via a direct comparison of collocated estimates from products with ground-based SSR measurements. However, the spatial nature of satellite remote sensing products and that of ground-based measurements are totally different. Essentially, what kilometer-level or pixel-level products provide are the areal retrieved values over the footprints of satellite pixels; what grid-level products give are the means within latitude-longitude grids; whereas ground-based measurements are point-specific. They are three distinct spatial samplings on surface radiation fields and embody the space attributes of kilometer-scale, grid-scale, and point-scale, respectively. Such scale diversity poses the following question: how well do surface point measurements represent the larger scale surrounding means characterized by satellite remote sensing products? If the error originating from their unique spatial sampling scales is defined as representativeness error, how large is it in the routine validation of remote sensing products? To our knowledge, an in-depth and comprehensive study on this issue has not been performed to this date. Sporadic, related researches mainly focus on discussions of sampling errors between the kilometer-scale and the grid-scale spaces. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate and quantify the representativeness errors from the point-scale to the kilometer-scale, to the grid-scale.",
                "Ground-based solar radiation measurements are frequently used for directly validating satellite-derived surface solar radiation (SSR) products and even correcting any biases in the remote sensing products. Nevertheless, we realize that their spatial representativeness is per se different, and differences of observations and products not only are caused by the product-generating algorithms themselves but also by poor representativeness of surface sites. Moreover, we note that representativeness errors of point-scale ground-based solar radiation measurements are also related to the local climate and weather regimes, especially cloud climatology. Thus, representativeness of surface measurements is region-specific."

By analyzing representativeness errors of point-scale ground-based SSR measurements with respect to different levels of areas (kilometer-level or grid-level), implications for the routine validation of remote sensing products are drawn and presented finally.",

Our study demonstrates that wildly fluctuating representativeness errors indeed exist in the routine validation of remote sensing products, which strongly depend on their time and space scales as well as instant atmospheric conditions. Our practical validation via utilizing the high-density SSR matrix observations further points out that on the instantaneous and 0.05° time-space scales the error due to the inadequate representativeness of point-scale measurements increases the final RMSE by approximately 13.4%. Our discussion on representativeness errors will promote a better assessment for different types of remote sensing products using ground-based observations, and thereby is also beneficial to the further improvements of the quality of satellite-derived products."

                "Compared to other routine meteorological parameters, the measurements of surface radiation components are more prone to all kinds of errors. However, due to the limitation of our observed data (direct beam radiation and diffuse radiation were not measured independently in the experiment), it is very difficult to find a valid approach to correct the leveling-induced error. One natural challenge for current high spatial resolution SSR satellite products is the cloud inhomogeneity given the fact that 3D radiative transfer effects are neglected in the retrieval scheme.",
                "As spatial coverage increases, a single observation site really increasingly can not represent the areal means of the grid, even if the site is located at the center of the grid. Here representativeness error probably has a great influence on routine validation results because compared with kilometer-level products grid-level products are insensitive to some errors (e.g., the error from cloud inhomogeneity and 3D radiative transfer effects)."

That is, the \"areal SSR\" over the 1×1 km2 and the 5×5 km2 domains were separately estimated by averaging the measurements from Sites 4, 6 and 7, and all sites except Site 16. Second, measured SSR from each individual site were compared with the estimates of areal SSR, and differences between them were deemed the representativeness error from point to kilometer scales. Representativeness error of point-scale measurements with respect to grid-level surrounding include two levels of errors, namely detailed error from point to kilometer scales and macroscopic error from kilometer to grid scales. Accordingly, the macroscopic representativeness errors for the 0.25° × 0.25°, 0.50° × 0.50° and 1° × 1° grid domains were separately calculated using the satellite products of 0.05° resolution produced by us before. During the matrix experiment, all measurements were carried out carefully with continuous supervision. Spirit levels and glass domes of the 17 radiometers were checked weekly to guard against any perceptible instrument tilting and possible soiling of the sensors."

Previous SSR satellite products over Heihe river basin in northwest China are used in the current study. The products were based on the look-up table algorithm of Huang, Ma, Liang, Liu, and Li (2011), and the Japanese second generation geostationary meteorological satellite, Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT). The original spatial resolution of the products is 0.05° (~5 km), and the temporal resolution is half hour."

                "The current study demonstrates that wildly fluctuating representativeness errors exist which are strongly contingent on the time and space scales of remote sensing products, as well as instant atmospheric conditions. For example, for an area of 5 × 5 km2 1.4~8.1% of representativeness errors are found from monthly to “instantaneous” timescales; while for an area of 1° × 1° grid 3.1~8.1% of representativeness errors are seen. Such scale-dependent representativeness errors offer some implications for validations of remote sensing products. On timescales longer than or equal to one day, representativeness errors do not need to be considered for validations of kilometer-level products, but on shorter timescales representativeness errors will affect the validation results to some extent. For instantaneous products with 5 km resolution, our study indicates over 13% of errors can be attributed to the inherent representativeness error, and 30-minute surface measurements are recommended for a routine validation. However, for validations of grid-level products, representativeness errors basically cannot be neglected regardless of timescales. The errors caused by the poor representativeness of surface sites, likely significantly contribute to the large differences between measurements and products.",
                "For the 1 × 1 km2 domain, 3.2~21.9 W/m2 of RMSD and 1.2~4.4% of RMD are found with the smaller value for monthly timescale and larger one for \"instantaneous\" timescale; whereas for the 5 × 5 km2 domain, 3.2~40.2 W/m2 of RMSD and 1.2~8.1% of RMD are seen, respectively. Meanwhile, representativeness errors of point-scale measurements with respect to the grid-level areas were discussed based on the combined efforts from HiWATER-MUSOEXE and the previous satellite products. Within the 0.25° × 0.25° grid, the composite RMSD and RMD respectively are 5.1~53.9 W/m2 and 1.9~9.8% corresponding to the monthly till the instantaneous averaging intervals; within the 0.50° × 0.50° grid, the range of composite RMSD and RMD are 6.3~70.3 W/m2 and 2.2~12.7%, respectively; while within the 1° × 1° grid, they are 8.8~91.7 W/m2 and 3.3~16.6%, respectively.",
                "Our study demonstrates that wildly fluctuating representativeness errors indeed exist in the routine validation of remote sensing products, which strongly depend on their time and space scales as well as instant atmospheric conditions. For the most common 5 × 5 km2 domain, the RMSD of the “instantaneous” representativeness error is about 40 W/m2 (~8.1% of the mean SSR); whereas for the standard 1° × 1° grid domain, the RMSD of the instantaneous representativeness error is as great as 91 W/m2 (~16.1% of the mean SSR). Such scale-dependent representativeness errors conversely provide critical constraints on the direct comparisons of surface measurements and satellite products, and thus are valuable for narrowing down the uncertainty range between them. For a kilometer-level SSR product, if its timescale is longer than or even equal to one day, in validation the error originating from their different spatial footprints can be completely neglected. However, if its timescale is less than one day, representativeness error has a certain influence on the validation result, especially for instantaneous products."
