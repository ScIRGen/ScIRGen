            "description": "Accurate estimation of the gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial vegetation is vital for understanding the global carbon cycle and predicting ecosystem response to future climate change. For the regional study, MODIS derived GPP is the wildly acknowledged datasets. This MODIS based annual GPP datasets for the Tibetan Pleatau (8km°×8km° spatial resolution products) is a cumulative composite of GPP values based on the original MOD17A2H and MYD17A2H at the yearly step. The scale factor is 0.0001 and the data type is GeoTIFF. Notice that the period covering by this dataset are consistent with the original MODIS dataset, for MOD is 2001 to 2020 while for MYD is 2002to 2020. Due to the first half year of MYD17A2H were not produced, we used the first half-year of MOD17A2H and the second half-year of MYD17A2H to produce the MYD GPP for 2002.",

                    "Answer": "MODIS satellite data products are a commonly used and important data source for estimating ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP). The MOD series data is available from 2001 onwards, while the MYD series data starts from 2002. In 2002, due to missing data in the MYD series for the first half of the year, the MOD series data was used as a substitute to obtain the MYD series data for that year.",

They provide key parameters for studying carbon flux, carbon storage, and carbon cycling processes, which are essential for evaluating the carbon balance of regional ecosystems and their contribution and response to global changes.",

                    "Answer": "Using MODIS satellite data products as the primary source for estimating ecosystem gross primary productivity is likely to provide a consistent and widely applicable dataset, given its broad coverage and regular updates. However, it may also introduce challenges related to spatial and temporal resolution, which could affect the accuracy and reliability of carbon flux assessments. The necessity to replace missing data, such as using MOD data to fill gaps in MYD data for 2002, might introduce discrepancies or uncertainties in annual GPP calculations. Despite these challenges, MODIS data remains a key tool for evaluating regional ecosystems' carbon balance and their contributions to global carbon dynamics.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to provide a crucial ecological functional indicator for global change research by estimating ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP). This serves as a key parameter for studying carbon flux, carbon storage, and carbon cycle processes in ecosystems. It lays the foundation for assessing the regional ecosystem's contribution and response to global carbon balance. The dataset aims to offer consistent annual-scale GPP data for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by integrating MOD17A2H and MYD17A2H data, addressing data gaps and ensuring compatibility with long-term spatial resolution data like GIMMS.",

The data is collected from 2001 to 2020 and involves accumulating the GPP data over the entire year, followed by spatial resampling to achieve consistency with the GIMMS long-term series spatial resolution for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. Additionally, due to sensor operational differences, data from the MOD series is used to substitute missing data for the MYD series in 2002, particularly for the first half of the year.",
