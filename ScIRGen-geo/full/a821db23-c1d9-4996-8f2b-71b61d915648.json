            "description": "This dataset employs the OGGM (a global-scale glacier evolution model that integrated the “Shallow Ice Approximation” ice dynamics) to project surface glacier mass balance, area, volume, and meltwater runoff over High Mountain Asia in the 21st century using temperature and precipitation data output from 5 different CMIP6 climate scenarios and 10 GCMs. Based on the optimal historical climate dataset, the Detrending Quantile Mapping (DQM) method is utilized to correct the CMIP6 outcomes. The historical results (2000~2021) are generated from OGGM driven by ERA5-Land reanalysis data. A two-stepwise method is employed to calibrate the key parameters in OGGM (temperature thresholds for distinguishing solid and liquid precipitation, ice melting and ablation coefficient, and ice flow creep parameter). This dataset can help us further understand the spatiotemporal pattern of future glacier changes in High Mountain Asia under climate warming and provide data support for studies and decision-making on sustainable development in regions highly dependent on glacial meltwater.",

This approach allows for the simulation and projection of various glacier attributes, such as surface mass balance, area, volume, and meltwater runoff, over a century-long period. By integrating outputs from five different CMIP6 climate scenarios and ten GCMs, researchers can account for diverse climate trajectories, improving the robustness and reliability of glacier evolution forecasts. Furthermore, applying the DQM method to correct climate data and using ERA5-Land reanalysis data for historical simulations ensure that the model is well-calibrated, enhancing prediction accuracy and helping to better understand the spatial and temporal evolution of glaciers in response to climate warming.",

The CMIP6 climate data is corrected using the DQM method, and historical simulations for 2000-2021 are driven by ERA5-Land reanalysis data.
