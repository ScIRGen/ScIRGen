            "description": "This dataset includes annual mosaics of Antarctic ice velocity derived from Landsat 8 images between December, 2013 and April, 2019, which was updated in 2020 in order to produce multi-year annual ice velocity mosaics and improve the quality of products including non-local means (NLM) filter, and absolute calibration using rock outcrops data. The resulting Version 2 of the mosaics offer reduced local errors, improved spatial resolution as described in the README file.",
            "instructions": "The 105×105-m gridded ice velocities for all of Antarctica are stored in a 16-bit integer GeoTIFF file format under a polar stereographic projection with a true latitude at 71 degree. The gridded ice velocity has been equally divided into 4 subsets in the X and Y directions in consideration of file size and computer processing speed (see Fig. S1). Note that file sizes have been kept at 1 Gigabyte for user friendliness and easy downloading. Each file contains three bands that show velocity vector components in both the X-direction and Y-direction and a gridded error map of the ice velocity. The structure of the ice velocity filenames is Velocity_l8_*begin date*_*end date*_*subset*_*XY* _*component*_v2.tif, where Velocity represents ice velocity data and l8 indicates the L8 satellite from which images are used to produce the ice velocity map. *begin date* is start date of the images that contributed to mosaic in format of ‘yyyyddd’, which ‘yyyy’ is four-digit start year and ‘ddd’ is three-digit day of start year, and *end date* is end date of images used in same format with start date. *subset* shows whether the ice velocity file has been cropped due to considerations of file size and computer processing speed, and *XY* indicates the relative coordinates among all files, where X is the column number starting with one and Y is the row number starting with one. *component* shows the components of velocity vectors by use of ‘vx’ and ‘vy’, which represents the easting and northing components.  Furthermore, the annual mosaics of ice velocity are also provided. The naming convention is the same as the description mentioned above.\nFor count maps\nThe count maps of number of ice velocity measurements for valid displacement maps stacked for ice velocity mosaics, and are stored in 16-bit integer GeoTIFF files (Fig. S2). These files also have the same file structure and projection as the gridded ice velocity maps. The naming convention of the count maps is Countimage_l8_*begin date*_*end date*_*subset*_*XY*.tif, which has the same naming convention as the ice velocity maps, except for “Countimage”,",

                "Ice velocity constitutes a key parameter for estimating ice-sheet discharge rates and is crucial for improving coupled models of the Antarctic ice sheet to accurately predict its future fate and contribution to sea-level change. Global warming could lead to significant mass changes in the Antarctic ice sheet. The ice mass of this sheet has a displacement potential equivalent to a sea level rise greater than 60-m, which would alter oceanic conditions and marine ecosystems, such as ocean currents, water temperature, and fishing ground distributions. Monitoring the glacial dynamics of the ice sheet is a primary scientific goal to determine whether the ice sheet is stable, growing or shrinking. Thorough and continued monitoring of ice-sheet dynamics is also of utmost importance for accurate predictions of ice-sheet behaviour in the future. Ice velocity, which is one key parameter representing ice dynamics, affects the estimates of ice-sheet mass balance and the corresponding sea level rise and plays a crucial role in studies on glacier dynamics and mass balance. The ice velocity of peripheral outlet glaciers is one of the primary parameters needed to determine the ice discharge rate, because these glaciers act as channels for ice transportation from the ice-sheet interior to the ice shelves and ocean. A comprehensive and lasting observation of ice velocity is important to better understand a wide range of processes related to glacial mass fluxes, such as glacier response to climate and climatic changes, glacier physics and flow modes, glacier flow instabilities (e.g., surges), subglacial processes (e.g., erosion), and supra- and intra-glacial mass transport."

                "Cloud contamination is a major challenge in ice velocity estimation using optical images, which is particularly significant in polar regions. Despite the improved geometric accuracy of L8, the residual geolocation errors (~8 m circular error (90%)) of the L8 panchromatic band contribute most of the uncertainties in ice velocity products. In Antarctica, absolute calibration is a challenging issue because the ice is active almost everywhere and available rock outcrops are extremely scarce."

            "methods": [
                "In this study, the L8 orthorectified panchromatic band scenes are used to generate ice velocity maps using the optical offset method, which will be summarized in Section 2.3. Specifically, the feature tracking processing has two stages. The first stage (namely, coarse co-registration) approximately estimates the pixelwise displacement between two patches. In this study, the size of the initial sliding window varies from 64 to 256 pixels in both the X and Y directions according to a priori knowledge from the InSAR-derived Antarctic ice velocity and the time interval between two paired images. Once the initial displacements are estimated, the second stage consists of fine co-registration to retrieve the sub-pixel displacement using a smaller window. The new size of 32×32 pixels is tentatively adopted to yield reliable estimates for the displacement at densely independent points. First, we suppress the noise on each displacement scene using an adaptive filter and a median filter. The adaptive filter is the local sigma filter (Eliason and McEwen, 1990) that features a filter size of 9 pixels and a sigma factor value of 2. A median filter is further applied to remove “salt and pepper” noise in ice displacement scenes. Second, the areas covered by clouds and water are excluded from the displacement scenes using the QA band (Zanter, 2016). In the QA band, each pixel contains a 16-bit integer that represents bit-packed combinations of surface, atmospheric, and sensor conditions at different confidence levels. The pixels covered by cloud and water in paired images are unpacked from the QA band using the procedures we have developed, and the pixels marked as clouds and water at high confidence levels (67–100%) are used to build a mask layer. These pixels are then masked in displacement scenes. Third, since frequency correlation easily causes errors at the edges of displacement scenes, the results of the displacement vectors are neglected at the edge regions."

The maps have an estimated uncertainty of less than 10 m yr-1 based on robust internal and external validations."

The near-zero y-intercept and nearly unitary slope of the data in Figure 6a confirm that the L8 ice velocity data are very consistent with the in situ measurements, even in the stable interior ice sheet. In summary, the L8 ice velocity data have an accuracy of 10 m yr-1 (3σ)."

                "Recent high-resolution Antarctic ice velocity maps reveal increased mass loss in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. A considerable challenge associated with rigorous sea level projections in the 21st century is that the dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet is not sufficiently understood in the context of rapidly warming atmosphere and ocean conditions. The West Antarctic ice sheet has experienced a negative mass balance, extensive dynamic thinning on the periphery, accelerated mass loss, and grounding line retreat in the Amundsen Sea sector, all of which have highlighted the long standing concerns about the marine based ice sheet instability. In contrast, it is generally considered that the EAIS, which encompasses a larger ice mass, has been in a state of mass equilibrium or has had a slightly positive mass balance over the past two decades. However, recent observations have detected thinning in some glaciers on the EAIS, resulting in a negative mass balance in the ice catchments. Ice dynamic studies based on ice sheet modelling also indicate sensitivity to ocean forcing. All of these findings suggest that the EAIS has a highly dynamic nature and may be more vulnerable to climatic and oceanography forcing than previously thought. Ice velocity, one of the critical ice dynamic parameters that affects estimates of the ice sheet mass balance and the corresponding sea level rise, has been determined from traditional ground-based measurements (e.g., GPS, electronic distance, etc.) since the 1970s in the Antarctic ice sheet."

The mass balance of the predominantly land-based EAIS remains less clear due to the lack of observable evidence. It is also unclear whether the rate of Antarctic ice loss/gain has increased/decreased over the past two decades. Furthermore, the underlying drivers of ice sheet changes remain poorly understood. The sporadic and discontinuous observations prohibit the study of the ice sheet mass balance as a whole. The lack of high-resolution ice velocity data limits a thorough investigation of localized ice dynamics, such as crevasse production, the role of ice rises on the stability of ice sheets, etc."
