            "description": "The geomorphic data of Heihe River are from the geomorphic Atlas of the people's Republic of China (1:1 million). This data is based on remote sensing image and other multi-source data integration and update. The main data used and referenced include: 1) remote sensing image data: TM and 2000's around 1990's nationwide About ETM image; 2) historical geomorphic map: 15 published 1 million geomorphic maps, two sets of 1:4 million geomorphic maps in China, 500000 or 1 million geomorphic sketches in all provinces and cities in China; 3) basic geographic data: 1:250000 basic geographic data and 250000 DEM data in China; 4) geological data: 1:500000 geological map in China; 5) relevant thematic maps: land use map, vegetation map and land resource map And so on. The interpretation method adopts the human-computer interaction method based on ArcGIS, and is carried out according to the interpretation sequence of hierarchical classification: the first layer: plain and mountain; the second layer: basic geomorphic types (28); the third layer: 10 genetic types; the fourth layer: secondary genetic types; the fifth layer: morphological difference classification types; the sixth layer: secondary morphological difference classification types; the seventh layer: slope, slope The eighth layer is the type of geomorphic material determined by material composition or lithology; the ninth layer is the combination of 1-7 layers of map spots. There are 441 geomorphic types and codes. Data fields include: fenfu (view frame number), name (attribute), class (code), sname (administrative division).",

                    "Answer": "Remote sensing images and historical geomorphological maps are chosen due to their ability to provide comprehensive spatial coverage and temporal data, which are crucial for understanding geomorphological changes over time. Remote sensing, particularly TM and ETM images, offers detailed and up-to-date information about the Earth's surface, while historical maps provide a baseline for comparison and validation of changes. This combination allows for more accurate and reliable data integration and updating of geomorphological information.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating multi-source data such as remote sensing imagery, historical geomorphological maps, and geological data can enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of geomorphological datasets by providing a more detailed and updated representation of geomorphological features. This approach allows for the inclusion of diverse information, such as landforms, geological structures, and historical landscape changes, which can improve the differentiation and classification of geomorphological types.

                    "Answer": "The ultimate goal of integrating multi-source data, including remote sensing imagery, historical geomorphological maps, and geological data, is to create a comprehensive and updated geomorphological dataset for the Heihe River Basin. This integration aims to enhance the accuracy and detail of geomorphological classification, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the region's landforms. By employing a structured interpretation method using ARCGIS, the dataset categorizes geomorphological features into multiple layers, providing a detailed analysis needed for environmental research, land use planning, and resource management.",

                    "Answer": "The integration and updating of multi-source datasets for geomorphological analysis involve several procedural steps: 1) Utilize remote sensing image data like TM images from around the 1990s and ETM images from around the 2000s as primary data sources. 2) Reference historical geomorphological maps, including published 1:1,000,000 maps, two sets of national 1:4,000,000 maps, and provincial 1:500,000 or 1:1,000,000 sketch maps. 3) Incorporate foundational geographic data from national 1:250,000 geographic datasets and 1:250,000 DEM data. 4) Use geological data from national 1:500,000 geological maps. 5) Include related thematic maps such as land use, vegetation, and land resources maps. 6) Employ ARCGIS-based human-computer interaction methods for the interpretation process, following a layered and hierarchical approach: first layer - plains and mountains; second layer - basic geomorphological types (28 types); third layer - 10 genetic types; fourth layer - secondary genetic types; fifth layer - morphological differentiation types; sixth layer - secondary morphological differentiation types; seventh layer - slope, aspect, and gradient differentiation; eighth layer - material composition or lithology-based geomorphological types; ninth layer - merge layers 1-7 into a cohesive map. The aim is to create a comprehensive dataset covering 441 geomorphological types and their codes.",
