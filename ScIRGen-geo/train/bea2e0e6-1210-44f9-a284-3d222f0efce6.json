            "description": "This dataset contains three basic remote sensing data of digital topography (DEM), TM remote sensing image and NDVI vegetation index of badan jilin desert.\n1. DEM, digital terrain data, from the SRTM1 data set released by NASA in the United States, was cropped in the desert area.The resolution is 30 m.The data is stored in the DEM folder, and the dm.ovr file can be opened by ArcGIS.\n2. TM image data.The composite data of Landsat TM/ETM + 543 band released by NASA were cropped in the desert lake group distribution area.The resolution is 30 m.From 1990 to 2010, one scene was selected in summer and one scene in autumn every five years to analyze the long-term changes of the lake.In 2002, there was a scene for each quarter to analyze the changes of the lake during the year.The data is stored in TM folder, TIFF format, can be opened by ArcGIS or ENVI software.The file naming rule is yyyymm.tif, where yyyy refers to the year and mm to the month. For example, 199009 refers to the time corresponding to the impact data of September 1990.\n3. NDVI, vegetation index.The modis-ndvi product MOD13Q1, released by NASA, was cropped in desert areas.The NDVI data of every ten days of the growing season (June, July, August and September) from 2000 to 2012 are included. The spatial resolution is 250 m and the temporal resolution is 16 days.Stored in NDVI folder, TIFF format, can be opened by ArcGIS or ENVI software.Mosaic_tmp_yyyyddd.hdfout.250m_16_days_ndvi_roi.tif,\nWhere yyyy represents the year and DDD represents the day of DDD of the year.",
            "instructions": "File naming: the data is stored in raster tif format, the files are stored in folders of data type \"DEM\", \"NDVI\" and \"TM\", and the file naming rule is yyyymm.tif, where yyyy means year and mm means month, for example 199009 means the corresponding time of affected data is September 1990.NDVI folder, TIFF format, file naming rule is mosaic_tmp_yyyyddd.hdfout.250m_16_days_ndvi_roi.tif, where yyyy means year and DDD means day of the year.\nData reading: Envi, Arcgis and other remote sensing software can be used to open and read",

                    "Answer": "The DEM data sourced from SRTM1 has a spatial resolution of 30 meters and does not include temporal data, as it is typically used for static topographical analysis. In contrast, MODIS-derived NDVI data has a spatial resolution of 250 meters and a temporal resolution of 16 days, allowing for more frequent monitoring of vegetation changes over time in the desert. This difference highlights that DEM data is more suitable for detailed terrain analysis, while NDVI data provides insights into temporal vegetation dynamics.",

This data is stored in a DEM folder and can be opened with ArcGIS. TM imagery data is derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ 543 band composite data, clipped to focus on areas with distributed desert lakes, also with a 30-meter resolution.
