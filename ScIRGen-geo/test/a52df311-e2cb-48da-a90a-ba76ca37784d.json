            "description": "This dataset includes component temperatures measured by the thermal infrared (TIR) radiometers at the Mixed Forest and Sidaoqiao stations between 22 July, 2014 and 19 July, 2016. The Mixed Forest (101.1335 °E, 41.9903 °N, 874 m.a.s.l.) and Sidaoqiao (101.1374 °E, 42.0012 °N, 873 m.a.s.l.) stations were located in the downstream of the Heihe River basin, Dalaihubu Town, Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia. \nAt the Mixed Forest station, two TIR radiometers (SI-111, Apogee Instruments Inc., USA) connected to a data logger (CR800, Campbell Scientific Inc., USA) measured component temperatures of the sunlit canopy and shaded canopy. TIR radiometers were mounted horizontally at 5 m height on iron rods just south and north of a tree and pointed to its canopy. The distance from the sensor to the canopy was ~1 m. At the Sidaoqiao station, two SI-111 TIR radiometers connected to a CR800 data logger measured component temperatures of the soil and shrub. The first sensor pointed from 2 m height under a viewing zenith angle of 45° to bare soil; the second sensor was mounted at 1-m height and pointed horizontally into the shrub canopy.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of ecological hydrology remote sensing experiments, 'component temperature' refers to the measurement of temperatures of specific parts or elements of an ecosystem, such as the temperatures of different vegetation types or soil surfaces. These measurements are typically taken using infrared radiometers and are crucial for understanding the thermal dynamics and energy exchanges within the ecosystem.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods involve different sensor setups for the mixed forest and superstation sites. At the mixed forest site, two sensors are used to observe component temperatures of sunlit and shaded poplar trees, mounted approximately 5 meters high and 1 meter from the target. At the superstation site, sensors observe bare soil and tamarisk temperatures, with the bare soil sensor mounted 2 meters high at a 45° zenith angle and the tamarisk sensor 1 meter high and 0.5 meters from the target.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in component temperature readings between sunny and shaded areas of Populus euphratica may indicate significant microclimatic differences within mixed forest environments. These differences can provide insights into how sunlight exposure affects surface temperatures, which in turn can influence local weather patterns, plant growth, and water evaporation rates. The use of dual sensors at different heights and orientations allows for detailed observation of these microclimatic variations.",

                    "Answer": "Using fixed infrared radiometers, such as the SI-111, for long-term temperature observations in mixed forest environments could lead to variations in data accuracy due to factors like sensor drift over time, environmental changes affecting sensor exposure, and potential obstructions or shading from vegetation. Ensuring consistent calibration and maintenance of the sensors is crucial to mitigate these impacts.",

This information is crucial for ecological and hydrological studies, as it helps in monitoring and modeling energy exchanges and water cycles in the Heihe River Basin's downstream environments.",
