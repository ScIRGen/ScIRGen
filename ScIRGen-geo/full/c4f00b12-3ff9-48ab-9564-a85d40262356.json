            "description": "This dataset includes the concentrations and spatial pattern of mercury (Hg) in the foliage of the local tree species over the easteran and the southern Tibetan Plateau. Fifty-three leaf samples were collected, and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry (CVAFS) was used to analyse the Hg contents. The limit of detection (LOD) for this method is 1.8 ng/g. The standard reference material, foliage GB GSW-11, which is supplied by National Institute of Metrology P.R.China, was also analyzed for assessing the accuracy of this method, and the recoveries of this method were 94.6%±9.7%. This dataset will provide the informations of foliage absoprtion to Hg over the Tibetan Plateau.",
