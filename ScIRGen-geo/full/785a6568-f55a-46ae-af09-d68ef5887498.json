            "description": "The data include the element composition, isotopic composition, temperature and particle size of coesite. The elemental composition and isotopic composition were obtained from electron microprobe, laser ablation mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The experiment was carried out by a large press, and the water content in coesite was obtained by infrared spectroscopy. The existence of structural water in coesite will accelerate its retrograde metamorphism to quartz, so it can not be preserved in the process of continental exhumation. In this research, hydrous coesite samples were synthesized by a series of high temperature and high pressure experiments. The results show that the water binding mechanism of coesite is different under different conditions. At 5 GPa, in the system without boron, the water solubility increases with the increase of temperature when the temperature is not higher than 1300 ℃. Furthermore, on the one hand, coesite can only carry a very small amount of water into the subduction zone; On the other hand, it is because there is almost no structural water in coesite that coesite can be preserved during exhumation.",

                    "Answer": "The study suggests that the mechanisms of water incorporation in coesite vary under different conditions. At 5 GPa in a boron-free system, water solubility in coesite increases with temperature up to 1300 ℃. This implies that water incorporation is temperature-dependent and may involve different structural sites or bonding mechanisms within the coesite lattice. Furthermore, the limited presence of structural water in coesite indicates a potential mechanism for its preservation during subduction and exhumation processes.",

This is achieved through a series of high-temperature, high-pressure experiments. The presence of structural water in coesite significantly accelerates its retrogression to quartz, preventing its preservation during continental crust subduction and exhumation. The study explores how coesite's water-carrying capacity is limited in subduction zones and how the absence of structural water aids in its preservation during exhumation.",
