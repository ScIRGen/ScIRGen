By selecting the epicentral distance of 30-90 degrees and the teleseismic events greater than 5.5 degrees recorded by 4 fixed stations set up by China Seismological Bureau and 10 mobile stations set up by Institute of Geology and Geophysics of Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2010 to 2012 in the study area, the time domain iterative deconvolution method is used to obtain the radial convergence function. The results show that: the thickness of sedimentary layer is mainly distributed in 4.2-7.6 km, and the wave velocity ratio is generally more than 1.87; the thickness of bedrock is mainly distributed in 33.4-41.8 km, and the wave velocity ratio is generally less than 1.74. The uploaded data provide valuable data and information for others to further study the structural characteristics of Sichuan Basin.",

Structures of the sedimentary cover and crystalline crust, for example, thickness and Vp/Vs ratio, are of great significance to study the basin’s properties and evolution, which have not been investigated simultaneously. The sedimentary cover keeps a record of formation and evolution of a basin, which usually hosts petroleum and mineral deposits. The low-velocity sedimentary cover introduces error and false image beneath the subsediment crust, such as the crustal thickness and S-wave velocity, in traditional receiver-function (RF) analysis."
