            "description": "The Qinghai Tibet Plateau is the highest and most widely distributed plateau in the world. Its main body only uplifted to the current plateau in the Cenozoic era, accompanied by large-scale crustal shortening. However, there is significant controversy in the field of plateau lithosphere deformation time and volume. Based on this, on the one hand, detailed zircon U-Pb dating was conducted on the Eocene Meisu Formation volcanic rocks in Nanqiangtang, and on the other hand, paleomagnetic research was conducted on this volcanic rock. Volcanic rocks are mainly andesite. Firstly, the rocks are crushed to 60-80 mesh, and then single zircon particles are selected through physical sorting. They are then glued to the target site, and the internal structure of the zircon is revealed through CL images. The upper machine site is selected. Measure the content of zircon U and Pb using the LA-ICP-MS experimental setup to obtain isotopic radioage. After testing three samples, the absolute ages of the volcanic rocks in the Meisu Formation were 40.2 ± 0.5 Ma (± 2 σ,  MSWD=3.0, n=49), 39.9 ± 0.5 Ma (± 2 σ,  MSWD=4.0, n=46), and 39.7 ± 0.4 Ma (± 2 σ,  MSWD=1.7, n=44). The establishment of the US Soviet Formation in this era was a key product of the plateau uplift stage.",

This method involves measuring the ratios of uranium and lead isotopes in zircon crystals extracted from the rock samples to calculate their absolute ages, which provides insights into the timing of geological events such as the uplift of plateaus.",

                    "Answer": "Combining zircon U-Pb dating and paleomagnetic studies of volcanic rocks can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the uplift history and crustal shortening of the Tibetan Plateau. By obtaining precise isotopic ages and paleomagnetic data, researchers can better determine the timing and extent of geological events that contributed to the plateau's formation. This approach can help clarify the debated issues regarding the timing and magnitude of lithospheric deformation in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve crushing the volcanic rock to 60-80 mesh, physically selecting zircon single grains, and mounting them on a target. CL imaging is used to reveal the internal structure of the zircon, after which measurement points are selected for analysis. LA-ICP-MS is employed to measure the concentrations of U and Pb in the zircon, allowing for the determination of isotopic radiometric ages, which are crucial for establishing the timing of the uplift phase of the Meisu Group in the Tibetan Plateau.",
