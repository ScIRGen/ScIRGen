            "description": "The data set contains the data of thermal diffusion fluid flow meter in the hydrometeorological observation network from January 1 to December 31, 2015. The study area is located in huyang forest, ejin banner, alxa league, lower reaches of heihe, Inner Mongolia autonomous region.According to the different height and diameter at breast height of iminqak, choose install Thermal diffusion flow meter sample tree (Thermal Dissipation SAP flow velocity Probe, TDP), domestic TDP pin type Thermal diffusion plant flow meter, model for TDP30.The TDP1 point and TDP2 point of sample plots were set in the vicinity of mixed forest station and populus populus station, respectively.Sample tree height from high to low in turn for TDP2 (16.4 meters, 18.3 meters, 16.9 meters), TDP1 (12.5 meters, 13 meters, 14 meters), diameter at breast height order from large to small is TDP1 (48 cm, 41.6 cm, 46.6 cm), TDP2 (33.8 cm, 38.5 cm, 42.3 cm), density of TDP1 respectively (0.0158 per square meter) tree, TDP2 (0.0116 per square meter), to represent the whole area of populus euphratica transpiration measurement.Two sets of probes are installed in each sample tree, with a height of 1.3 meters and a direction of east and west of the sample tree.\nThe original observation data of TDP is the temperature difference between the probes, and the collection frequency is 10s, with an average output of 10 minutes.The published data are calculated and processed trunk flow data, including flow rate V (cm/h), flux Fs (cm3/h) and daily transpiration Q (mm/d) per 10 minutes.Firstly, the liquid flow rate and liquid flux were calculated according to the temperature difference between the probes, and then the transpiration Q per unit area of the forest zone was calculated according to the area of Euphrates poplar forest and the distance between trees at the observation points.At the same time, post-processing was carried out on the calculated rate and flux value :(1) data that obviously exceeded the physical significance or the instrument range were removed;(2) the missing data is marked with -6999;(3) suspicious data caused by probe fault or other reasons shall be identified in red, and the data confirmed to have problems shall be removed.\nPlease refer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Qiao et al. (2015) for observation data processing.",
