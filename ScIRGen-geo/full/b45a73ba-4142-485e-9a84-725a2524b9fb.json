The main steps of the processing include: outfield value elimination, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output after processing was also screened :(1) the data when the instrument was wrong was removed;(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation were excluded;(3) the missing rate of 10Hz original data is more than 10% every 30min;(4) the observed data of weak turbulence at night were excluded (u* less than 0.1m/s).The average period of observation data was 30 minutes, 48 data a day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.May 14 solstice May 20 and May 24 solstice June 6 due to power converter damage, data missing.\nThe observation data released by vortex correlator include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (K), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), the length of cloth hoff, sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest are 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Guo et al, 2020 for information of observation test or site, and Liu et al.

                "Aerodynamic roughness length (z0m) is a key factor in surface flux estimations with remote sensing algorithms and/or land surface models. Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

                "Sensible and latent heat fluxes are important indicators reflecting the intensity of heat and water vapor exchange between the land and atmosphere, influencing the energy balance between them. They provide material, dynamic, and thermal sources for weather systems of different scales and affect the water cycle process between the land and atmosphere. Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness only in the range of tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), compared to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS can better match the pixel scale of satellite imagery and the grid scale of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth for the pixel/grid scale of remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thus optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the observed atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."

                    "Answer": "Eddy covariance systems measure surface fluxes at smaller spatial scales, while large aperture scintillometers cover larger areas. By combining data from both methods and using a footprint model, researchers can analyze differences and validate model accuracy. The comparison helps in understanding the scale-dependent nature of surface flux measurements and addressing energy balance issues in eddy covariance observations.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of eddy covariance system datasets, data processing typically involves steps such as outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction, and density correction. Quality assessment often focuses on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics. These methodologies are effective in ensuring the reliability of data by filtering out erroneous readings and adjusting for various physical and instrumental factors.",

                    "Answer": "The measurement of sensible heat flux using large aperture scintillometer data is affected by factors such as beam height, wind speed, zero-plane displacement height, and Bowen ratio over wet surfaces. Improvements could include ensuring the beam height is much larger than the zero-plane displacement height and accurately determining the Bowen ratio. Additionally, adjustments for atmospheric conditions like air temperature and pressure could be considered to refine measurements over heterogeneous surfaces.",
