                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surrounding region are considered as the Third Pole on the Earth with an average elevation of approximately 4000 m. Due to the high elevation, TP has a warming rate higher than the global average, resulting in various severe environmental changes such as glacier retreat, permafrost degradation, lake expansion, and increasing river discharge and sediment flux. Air temperature is the most direct indicator of global warming, and it is also an important variable for investigating the changes and mechanisms of various hydrological and ecological processes such as snow or glacier melting and photosynthesis. However, air temperature observations are scarce in TP in particular in high-altitude areas due to harsh terrain and weather conditions. To overcome the problem of air temperature data scarcity, a variety of reanalysis and land data assimilation methods have been developed in the last several decades, such as the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 Project (NNRP-2), the 20th Century Reanalysis Version V2c (20CRV2c), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis Project (JRA-55), the ERA-Interim, the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) and ERA5. These efforts have produced various datasets by using advanced model and assimilation techniques to efficiently incorporate observations from multiple sources with consideration of physical relations between multiple types of the observations. The air temperature datasets derived from the reanalysis or assimilation data need to be corrected for complex terrains in TP, because spatial resolutions (ranging from 0.25° to 2.5°) of the derived data are too coarse to reflect complex topography in TP. Downscaling is thus needed to achieve a higher horizontal resolution, and the resolution of 1 – 3 km is considered to be satisfactory for complex terrains. For downscaling air temperature, the temperature lapse rate (TLR) (i.e., the rate of temperature change with elevation) is the most commonly used variable. A constant value of 0.0065 °C/m has been used for downscaling and distributing the air temperature data of CFSR, GLDAS and JRA-55 from a coarse grid to a finer grid. However, since TLR is not a constant, but varies in space and time in TP and its surrounding areas, using a constant TLR is unsuitable for downscaling the reanalysis data in TP such as ERA-Interim. Methods that estimate more accurate TLRs have been developed, for instance, by calculating local and monthly TLRs based on neighboring stations or using the temperature gradient of synoptic data from different pressure levels. It has been shown that the station-based TLR may not be optimal for downscaling when a small number of weather stations are insufficient to represent spatial variability at the scale of a grid block. Recently, based on the strong correlation and consistency between air temperature and remote sensing land surface temperature (LST), MODIS LST data have been used for estimating TLR for the TP."

To improve the Tair estimation, this study develops a novel machine-learning based method that uses the Gradient Boosting model to efficiently integrate observations from high-elevation stations with eight widely used air temperature reanalysis and assimilation datasets (i.e., NNRP-2, 20CRV2c, JRA-55, ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, CFSR, ERA5 and GLDAS2) downscaled with remote sensing-based temperature lapse rates (TLR). This method is used to generate a new dataset of daily air temperature with the 1-km resolution for the period of 1980 – 2014. This study also provides a framework for integrating multiple reanalysis and assimilation temperature data with elevation correction in mountainous regions that is not restricted to the TP."

A new TLR estimation method is developed to first estimate spatially continuous monthly TLRs from MODIS LST and then downscale daily mean Tair from eight reanalysis and assimilation datasets to obtain Tair at the 1-km resolution using the MODIS-estimated TLRs. The Gradient Boosting (GB) model is selected for integrating the eight downscaled Tair and five other auxiliary variables. The models are trained and validated using observations from 100 common stations (i.e. China Meteorology Administration stations) and 13 independent high-elevation stations (4 on glaciers)."

Finally, the GB-integrated Tair further outperforms the downscaled JRA-55 Tair with the mean root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) of 1.7 °C versus 2.0 °C, especially in high-elevation stations with mean RMSD of 1.9 °C versus 2.7 °C.
