            "titleEn": "High resolution (5m) dataset of glacier elevation changes in Nyainqentanglha mountains on the Tibetan Plateau (2000‒2013, 2000‒2017)",
            "description": "This dataset includes data of glacier elevation changes in 2000‒2013 and 2000‒2017 at high spatial resolution (5 m). The specific areas are Namco area in the west section of Nyainqentangula Mountains (WNM) and Kangri Karpo area in the east section of Nyainqentangula Mountains (ENM). Glacier boundary refers to Randolph Glacier Inventory Version 4.0 (RGI 4.0). The glacier elevation changes were calculated from the DEM data generated by ZiYuan-3 Three-Line-Array (ZY-3 TLA) stereo images in 2013 and 2017 and SRTM DEM data in 2000, respectively. The data in the WNM include three periods, i.e., 2000‒2013, 2013‒2017 and 2000‒2017. The data in the ENM include one period, i.e., 2000‒2017. \nThe spatial resolution of the dataset is 5 meters, the unit is m a^−1, the data format is GeoTIFF, the data type is floating-point, and the projection mode is UTM 46N for the west segment and UTM 47N for the east segment.\nThe glacier elevation change can be transformed into the glacier mass balance (unit: w.e. a^−1) of corresponding temporal intervals by multiplying the average density of the glacier. This dataset can provide the details of the spatial patterns of glacier elevation changes to support modeling studies of glacier mass balance in this region.",
            "instructions": "The glacier elevation change data is stored in GeoTIFF, the file name is \"ZY_3_GEC_XXX_YYYY_ZZZZ.tif\", where “ZY_3” represents the satellite, “GEC” represents the glacier elevation change data, “XXX” represents the data area (WNM and ENM are the western and eastern Nyainqentanglha Mountain, respectively), “YYYY” represents the starting year, and “ZZZZ” represents the ending year. For example, “ZY_3_GEC_WNM_2000_2013.tiff” is the glacier elevation change data over the western Nyainqentanglha Mountains between 2000 and 2013.",

                    "Answer": "DEM differencing is a method used to determine glacier elevation changes by comparing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from different time periods. In the field of glacier elevation change studies, DEMs generated from high-resolution stereo image pairs and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data are used. The differences between these DEMs over specific time intervals provide insights into how glacier elevations have changed.",

                    "Answer": "Using high-resolution DEM data from 2013 and 2017, compared to the 2000 SRTM DEM data, results in more detailed spatial distribution of glacier elevation changes due to the higher spatial resolution of 5m. This allows for a more accurate assessment of glacier mass balance when combined with the average density of glaciers, providing a more nuanced understanding of glacier elevation and mass changes over time.",

The data is validated for consistency by comparing it with existing mass balance measurements and other remote sensing observations, ensuring good agreement and providing detailed spatial distribution details of glacier elevation changes.",
