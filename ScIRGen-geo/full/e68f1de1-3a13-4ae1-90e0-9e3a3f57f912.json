            "description": "In 2018, the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Programme tasked a research team to conduct an \"Investigation of the water vapor channel of the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon\" in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. This team subsequently established a three-dimensional comprehensive observation system of land-air interaction, water vapor transport, cloud cover, and rainfall activity along different altitude from south to north along the YGC canyon. Motuo meteorological station is an integrated observation base of a variety of large observation equipment. The whole comprehensive observation network includes 2 cloud radars, 2 micro rain radars, seven sets of eddy covariance  flux sites for measuring land-air interaction, 3 sets of microwave radiometers , 6 sets of GPS water vapor observatories, 2 sets of automatic weather stations and 19 sets of rainfall buckets.",
