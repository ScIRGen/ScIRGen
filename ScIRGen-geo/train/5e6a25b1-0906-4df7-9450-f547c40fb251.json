This method allows for precise collection and digital processing of light signals, which can lead to high-quality and accurate genome sequence information. Such technological approaches imply that the sequencing data can be effectively used to analyze the genetic structure of ancient populations, as well as to explore interactions between human groups and cultural expansions, as seen in the genetic analysis of populations from the Tibetan Empire period at the northeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

This involves the aggregation of DNA molecules and fluorescent probes on DNA nanoballs (DNB) and capturing light signals through a high-resolution imaging system. These signals are then digitized to obtain high-quality and accurate sample sequence information. This technical approach, combined with archaeological data, allows for a comprehensive analysis of genetic structures, as seen in the study of the population at the Wayan Reservoir site from the Tibetan Empire period.",
