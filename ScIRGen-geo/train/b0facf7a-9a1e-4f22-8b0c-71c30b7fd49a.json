            "description": "The dataset is the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the NDVI equation which defined the difference between NIR band and red band.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow. The NDVI can indicate  the health of vegetation and the growth of vegetation,it is thusly widely used in agriculture, forestry, ecological environment and other fields. It is also an important input parameter for the inversion of ecological physical parameters, and is one of the most widely used vegetation indexes.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the NDVI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the NDVI bands, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDVI;the NDVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
