            "description": "The data set contains nearly 15 years of eddy covariance data  from an alpine steppe ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau.The data was processed following standardized quality control methods to allow for comparability between the different years of  our record and with other data sets. To ensure meaningful  estimates of ecosystem atmosphere exchange, careful application of the following correction procedures and analyses was necessary: (1) Due to the remote location, continuous maintenance of the eddy covariance (EC) system was not always possible, so that cleaning and calibration of the sensors was performed irregularly. Furthermore, the high proportion of bare soil and high wind speeds led to accumulation of dirt in the measurement path of the infrared gas analyzer (IRGA). The installation of the sensor in such a challenging environment resulted in a considerable drift in CO2 and H2O gas density measurements. If not accounted for, this concentration bias may distort the estimation of the carbon uptake. We applied a modified drift correction procedure following Fratini et al. (2014) which, instead of a linear interpolation  between calibration dates, uses the CO2 concentration measurements  from the Mt. Waliguan atmospheric observatory as reference time series. (2) We applied rigorous quality filtering of the calculated fluxes to retain only fluxes which represent actual physical processes. (3) During the long measurement period, there were several buildings constructed in the near vicinity of the EC system. We investigated the influence of these obstacles on the turbulent flow regime to identify fluxes with uncertain land cover contribution and exclude them from subsequent computations. (4) We calculated the de-facto standard correction for instrument surface heating during cold conditions (hereafter called sensor self heating correction) following Burba et al. (2008) and a revision of the original method following Frank and Massman (2020). (5)Subsequently, we applied the traditional and widely used gap filling procedure following Reichstein et al. (2005) to provide a more complete overview of the annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange.(6) We estimated the flux uncertainty by calculating the random flux error (RE) following Finkelstein and Sims (2001) and by using the standard deviation of the fluxes used for gap filling(NEE_fsd) as a measure for spatial and temporal variation.",

                "AnswerEn": "In a dataset from the Tibetan Alpine Steppe, a modified drift correction procedure is used, which references CO2 concentration measurements from a nearby atmospheric observatory instead of linear interpolation between calibration dates. This approach may differ from other remote eddy covariance sites that might rely on different reference data or interpolation methods. Additionally, the dataset addresses challenges such as dirt accumulation and high wind speeds, which might be more pronounced compared to other sites, requiring tailored correction procedures.",
                "AnswerCn": "在来自西藏高山草甸的数据集中，采用了一种改进的漂移校正程序，该程序参考了附近大气观测站的CO2浓度测量，而不是在校准日期之间进行线性插值。这种方法可能与其他遥感涡度协方差站点有所不同，后者可能依赖于不同的参考数据或插值方法。此外，该数据集还解决了诸如污垢积累和高风速等挑战，这些问题在其他站点可能更为明显，因此需要量身定制的校正程序。",

                "AnswerEn": "Due to the remote location of the eddy covariance system, continuous maintenance was not always possible, leading to irregular cleaning and calibration of sensors. Additionally, the high proportion of bare soil and high wind speeds resulted in the accumulation of dirt in the measurement path of the infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), causing a drift in CO2 and H2O gas density measurements. These factors necessitate rigorous quality filtering to retain fluxes that represent actual physical processes.",
                "AnswerCn": "由于涡度协方差系统的位置偏远，持续的维护并不总是可行，这导致传感器的清洁和校准不规律。此外，高比例的裸土和高风速导致红外气体分析仪（IRGA）测量路径中积累了污垢，从而导致CO2和H2O气体密度测量的漂移。这些因素需要严格的质量过滤，以保留代表实际物理过程的通量。",

This drift, if uncorrected, can distort the estimation of carbon uptake, impacting the accuracy and reliability of the dataset. A modified drift correction procedure may be necessary to address these issues and ensure meaningful estimates of ecosystem-atmosphere exchange.",

This involves consistent data processing and quality control to ensure comparability across different years and with other datasets. The dataset serves to enhance understanding of carbon and water flux dynamics in alpine steppe ecosystems, particularly in challenging environments like the central Tibetan Plateau, where factors such as soil conditions, wind, and sensor drift can affect data accuracy.",
