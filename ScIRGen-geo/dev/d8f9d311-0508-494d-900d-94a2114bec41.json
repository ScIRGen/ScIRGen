            "description": "The data include the location information of 23 seismic stations in Linfen Rift Valley and its surrounding areas and the teleseismic receiver function waveforms. By selecting the 30-90 degree epicentral distance and more than 5.5 earthquake events recorded by 23 high-frequency mobile seismic stations deployed by Institute of Surveying and Geophysics of Chinese Academy of Sciences in November 2017 with observation duration of one month, the radial convergence function is extracted by using the time domain iterative deconvolution method of CPS program. The results show that there are low velocity bodies of different scales in the middle and lower crust of Linfen rift area, and the depth of seismogenic layer increases from ~ 25km to ~ 34km from south to north, which roughly corresponds to the bottom interface of low velocity bodies in the crust; Most of the relocation earthquakes are located in the transition zone between high and low velocity bodies, one of which has a focal depth of 32km. The m7.75 Linfen earthquake is located in the high velocity body, and the M8.0 Hongdong earthquake is located at the bottom of the high velocity body. The uploaded data provide valuable data and information for others to further study the structural characteristics of Linfen Rift Valley and its adjacent areas.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of seismology, '接收函数' (receiver function) refers to a seismic analysis technique used to isolate the response of the Earth's subsurface structures to seismic waves. It involves deconvolving the vertical component of the seismic waveform from the radial and tangential components to focus on the P-to-S or S-to-P converted phases. This technique is applied in data collection for studying crustal structures by extracting the receiver function from seismic records, which helps in identifying variations in seismic wave velocities and delineating boundaries within the Earth's crust such as low-velocity zones or the depth of the seismogenic layer.",

                    "Answer": "The presence of low-velocity bodies in the mid-to-lower crust of the Linfen Rift area is identified through the analysis of far-field teleseismic event records. These low-velocity anomalies could be attributed to variations in crustal composition or temperature, which impact the propagation of seismic waves. Such anomalies can complicate the interpretation of seismic data by altering expected travel times and waveforms, thus posing challenges to accurately determining subsurface structures and earthquake source characteristics.",

This method enhances the understanding of subsurface structures like the ones observed in the Linfen Rift area, where it identified the presence of low-velocity bodies in the mid-to-lower crust and informed on the depth variation of seismic source layers.",

The CPS program's time-domain iterative deconvolution method is then applied to these recordings to extract the radial receiver functions. This process helps in identifying the presence of low-velocity bodies in the mid-to-lower crust and understanding the depth variations of the seismogenic layers across the region.",

These stations record seismic events at specific epicentral distances and magnitudes, allowing researchers to use time-domain iterative deconvolution methods, such as the CPS (Computer Programs in Seismology) program, to extract radial receiver functions. This approach facilitates the identification of low-velocity bodies and the determination of seismic layer depths within the crust.",
