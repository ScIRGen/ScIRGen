                "In mountainous areas, different altitudes exhibit distinct vertical zonation due to variations in water (precipitation) and heat (temperature) components. The southeastern Tibet's Sejila Mountain has a pronounced mountain vertical zonation feature: from the foot of the mountain to the summit, it includes broadleaf forest, mixed coniferous and broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, shrubs, and moss. The vegetation types in Sejila Mountain are rich, and the longevity of trees is notable (Lu et al., 2015). The tree line at 4390 m is one of the highest forest lines in the world, making it a hotspot for tree-ring and forest ecology research (Wang et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018). Currently, there is limited research on the vertical gradients of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain (Liang et al., 2011). Most studies by some scholars on the changes in temperature and precipitation vertical gradients in this region and its vicinity are primarily based on the data from the Bayi Station (formerly Linzhi Station) and the nearby Bomi Station, focusing on the vertical temperature lapse rate across the entire Tibetan Plateau (Jiang Jingchao et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2001, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) and precipitation gradients (Guo et al., 2016)."

                "Therefore, this article explores the vertical variation patterns of temperature and precipitation on the eastern and western slopes of the Sejila Mountain based on temperature and precipitation data from 11 meteorological stations. This not only deepens the understanding of the influence of slope orientation on the vertical gradient changes of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain but also helps to better understand the physiological and ecological characteristics of plant and animal distribution with altitude changes in the region. Additionally, it provides reliable data support for future hydrological modeling in this watershed area."

Based on the geographical locations of these stations, the stations in the Sejila Mountain area are divided into two natural geographical units according to slope orientation: the west slope (south slope) and the east slope (north slope). The temperature vertical lapse rate and precipitation gradient are estimated, with the Sejila Mountain Pass station belonging to both the west and east slopes. The estimation of the temperature vertical lapse rate and precipitation gradient is obtained through regression analysis based on the elevation of the stations and the temperature or precipitation amounts."

The western slope had λ values ranging from 0.69 to 0.72 °C·(100 m)^-1, with the lowest λ in 2016 and the highest in 2014, and an average λ of 0.71 °C·(100 m)^-1 from 2013 to 2018.

From 2013 to 2018, the average precipitation gradient on the eastern slope was 10.5 mm·(100 m)^-1, with a trend of increasing precipitation with elevation during the monsoon season, followed by a decrease and then an increase. In the non-monsoon season, the trend was a decrease followed by an increase, with a significant precipitation gradient above the southeastern Tibetan station."
