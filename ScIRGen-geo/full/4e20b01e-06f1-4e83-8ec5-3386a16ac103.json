            "description": "This data adopts the comprehensive risk of multi-hazard population around the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and the the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau area, which is composed of four modules: landslide and collapse hazard factors, landslide and collapse susceptibility model, exposed population and casualty rate. The disaster factors module includes seven factors: DEM, slope,aspect,profile curvature, rainfall, temperature, snow cover, GDP, and vegetation cover,Distance from fault zone,lithology,land utilization. The landslide and collapse  susceptibility model is a statistical analysis using logistic regression models to obtain landslide collapse hazard susceptibility probability values. The population exposure module is based on the overlay of different landslide hazard susceptibility classes with population data, where the population exposure under high, high, medium and low landslide hazard susceptibility classes are 100%, 70%, 30% and 10% respectively). The population casualty rate module is obtained based on the ratio of historical landslide hazard casualty population (2000-2018) to the exposed population for the same period of landslide hazard. Finally, the exposed population under different levels of landslide failure hazard susceptibility was calculated by substituting the 2020 population data and multiplied with the historical period landslide failure hazard population casualty rate to assess the combined multi-hazard population risk around  the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau  region.",

                "Flash floods are regarded as sudden and fast-flowing floods with violent rising levels of water and high peak discharges in response to high-intensity rainfall, dam failure, levee breaks and glacial lake outbursts within minutes up to 6 h for catchments up to 400 km2, which can often be accompanied by debris flows and landslides. This hazard is one of the most devasting natural processes, causing huge economic losses and casualties. In Europe, flash floods caused 40% of flood-related fatalities during 1950–2006. In the USA, flash floods are the deadliest flood events. Liu et al. reported 82% of all flood-related casualties in China during 2010–2016 were triggered by flash floods. Flash flooding is a natural hazard with one of the highest capacities to generate risk regarding the rapid socioeconomic development especially in mountain areas. Various groups, such as decision-makers, practitioners, stakeholders, and public administrations, have made numerous efforts to protect elements at risk and to reduce expected losses. However, the risk from flash flood events has been increasing significantly worldwide due to climate change, environmental degradation, population growth, and increases in wealth. These trends highlight the need to continuously improve the strategies of disaster risk mitigation and reduction. As the basis of developing risk mitigation and reduction strategies, deep studies of disaster risk are viewed as a critical requirement. Following the definition of risk, determining vulnerability quantitatively plays a key role in quantitative risk assessment and is also an essential need for developing mitigation and adaptation plans. Vulnerability is a function of the expected degree of loss or damage to a given element at risk due to the occurrence of hazardous events in the natural sciences. It varies between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning no loss or damage and 1 meaning total loss or damage. According to the definition of vulnerability, the quantitative assessment of vulnerability needs to understand the interaction between the hazard event and the exposed element, which is usually expressed by vulnerability curves."

This paper aims to close this gap and develop human vulnerability curves for flash floods to quickly assess human vulnerability and its risk by statistical functions and hydro-hydraulic models based on a well-documented flash flood event, the July 2016 flash flood event in the Taitou catchment, China."

                "Regarding flash floods, most studies have mainly focused on buildings and the economy but seldom on humans. This is mainly because of the lack of data on loss of life or flood intensity matched with loss of life, which makes the analysis of human vulnerability to flash floods one of the challenges in ongoing flood risk assessments."

                "A post-flood survey was conducted to obtain the maximum flooded area and water depth data caused by the July 2016 flash flood as well as the loss of life data due to this event. The July 2016 flash flood event was reconstructed to obtain flood characteristic data through the simulation of hydro-hydraulic models. The hydrological model HEC-HMS was used to obtain the hydrograph of the July 2016 flash flood, which was evaluated using the flow data obtained from references. Subsequently, the hydraulic model FLO-2D was used to reconstruct the July 2016 flash flood event to obtain the flood characteristics (e.g., water depth, flow velocity, depth-velocity product, and impact force). The evaluation of FLO-2D was carried out using post-flood surveys defining maximum flooded extent and flood depths. Then, statistical functions were used to fit the relationship between the flood characteristics and mortality calculated through post-flood surveys."

The digital elevation model (DEM) at a spatial resolution of 12.5 × 12.5 m was downloaded from the Alaska Satellite Facility for the whole area controlled by the Weishui station. An approximately 1 × 1-m DEM was obtained from the Hebei Provincial Geographic Information Bureau through cooperation for the Taitou catchment. The soil and land use maps were collected from the Geographical Information Monitoring Cloud Platform. Referring to Gaume and Borga, a post-flood survey of the most affected villages, Guiquan and Taitou villages, was developed in August 2018. This field survey collected two types of data: (1) victims of the July 2016 flash flood and their spatiotemporal circumstances of death and (2) the population that was exposed to floodwater."

                "The results show that the simulated peak discharge (548 m3/s) of the July 2016 flash flood for Taitou catchment was close to the estimated peak discharge (540 m3/s) by the existing literature. Likewise, the FLO-2D model showed a good performance in reconstructing the flash flood event (FitA = 80.89%, RMSE = 0.21, NSE = 0.89), indicating that the flood characteristics outputting from FLO-2D model can be able to develop the human vulnerability curves for flash floods. Furthermore, four different human vulnerability curves for flash floods were developed, which are all power functions of water depth, flow velocity, depth-velocity product, and impact force, respectively. The mortality caused by flash floods increased with all four flood characteristics; the growth rate of the velocity curve was the fastest. However, the fitting effect of the velocity curve was the poorest (R2 = 0.87, SSE = 0.155, RMSE = 0.18), while that of the water depth curve was the best (R2 = 0.97, SSE = 0.003, RMSE = 0.03). Our findings provide a quantitative way to quickly assess loss of life due to flash floods, which is more likely to have a good performance in arid and semi-humid regions of northern China."

Factors include DEM, slope, aspect, profile curvature, rainfall, temperature, snow cover, GDP, vegetation cover, distance to fault zone, lithology, and land use. The landslide susceptibility model employs logistic regression to statistically analyze the probability of landslide occurrences.
