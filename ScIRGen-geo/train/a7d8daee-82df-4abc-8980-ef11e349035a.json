            "description": "1) Data content:\nThe table contains the heavy mineral data results of Dahonggou profile during the period of 20-5ma, as well as the lithology of the sample, sampling stratum location and GPS points. The analysis results of heavy mineral data show that the Dahonggou section in the northern Qaidam Basin experienced three phased provenance changes at ~19 Ma, 11 Ma and 8 Ma, which provides heavy mineral data support for understanding the provenance change history in the northern Qaidam Basin since the Miocene.\n2) Data source and processing method\nExtraction and testing of heavy minerals: first remove fine particles (< 5 μ m) Light minerals, then heavy liquid tribromomethane is used to further extract heavy minerals through centrifugation, freezing and extraction. Finally, qemscan mineral identification technology is used for quantitative identification.\n3) Data quality\nThe sample collection and experimental treatment were carried out according to strict standards, and the data obtained were reliable.\n4) Data application achievements and Prospects\nOne SCI paper was published with this set of data.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of heavy mineral analysis from sediment samples in geological studies, changes in methodologies could be caused by the need to improve data accuracy and reliability. For example, adopting the static water settling method to remove fine particles and the use of heavy liquid separation techniques like tribromomethane for further extraction, followed by QEMSCAN for quantitative identification, reflects advancements in precise mineral identification. These changes are driven by the necessity to accurately capture the phases of provenance changes as observed around 19 Ma, 11 Ma, and 8 Ma in the study of the Qaidam Basin.",
