            "description": "The data involved two periods of geodetic glacier mass storage change of Naimona’Nyi glaciers in the western of Himalaya from 1974-2013 (unit: m w.e. a-1). It is stored in the ESRI vector polygon format. The data sets are composed of two periods of glacier surface elevation difference between 1974-2000 and 2000-2013, i.e. DHSRTM2000-DEM1974（DH2000-1974）、DHTanDEM2013-SRTM2000（DH2013-2000）. DH2000-1974 was surface elevation change between SRTM2000 and DEM1974, i.e. the earlier historical DEM (DEM1974, spatial resolution 25m) was derived from 1:50,000 topographic maps in October 1974(DEM1974,spatial resolution 25m). The uncertainty in the ice free areas of DH2000-1974 was ±0.13 m a-1. The surface elevation difference between 2000-2013 (DH2000-2013, by DinSAR techniques from SRTM DEM2000 and TSX/TDX data on Oct.17th in 2013) The uncertainty in the ice free areas of DH2013-2000 was ±0.04 m a-1. Glacier-averaged annual mass balance change (m w.e.a-1) was averaged annually for each glacier, which was calculated by DH2000-1974/DH2013-2000, glacier coverage area and ice density of 850 ± 60 kg m−3.  The attribute data includes Glacier area by Shape_Area (m2), EC74_00, EC00_13, i.e. Glacier-averaged surface elevation change in 1974-2000 and 2000-2013(m a-1), MB74_00, MB00_13 i.e. Glacier-averaged annual mass balance in 1974-2000 and 2000-2013 (m w.e.a-1), and MC74_00, MC00_13, Glacier-averaged annual mass change in 1974-2000 and 2000-2013 (m3 w.e.a-1), Uncerty_MB, is the uncertainty of glacier-averaged annual mass balance（m w.e. a-1）， Uncerty_MC, is the Maximum uncertainty of glacier-averaged annual mass change（m3 w.e. a-1）. The data sets could be used for glacier change, hydrological and climate change studies in the Himalayas and High Mountain Asia.",

                "It is well known that glaciers in mountains are retreating widely in a warmer climate during recent decades on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The runoffs from both glaciers and glacier lakes have been increased significantly, and the potential outbursts of glacier lakes have threatened the residence safety in China and the adjacent countries. However, most of the glaciers locate in very distant mountains. As glaciers are difficult to be investigated due to the huge investments and long traveling time of field surveys, remote sensing monitoring has been the major approach adopted to understand the changes of glaciers nowadays. Mountain glaciers, especially those in temperate regions, are considered one of the best natural indicators of climate change. In recent years, the contribution of glaciers to the rise in lake and sea levels has also received increasing attention, with global glacier melting contributing 29±13% to sea level rise, and global glaciers and ice caps contributing 61±19% to sea level rise. The Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent mountain regions have developed glaciers covering an area of about 50,000 km², which is the largest glacier area in the mid-low latitude region outside the polar regions, and is the source of many famous rivers in Asia, as well as a precious water resource in the arid inland areas. Glacier activity is an important factor inducing glacier debris flow, ice/snow avalanches, and glacier lake outburst floods, with glacier floods often being one of the most impactful glacier disasters. For example, glacier melting leads to the formation and expansion of moraine lakes, and glacier flood disasters caused by moraine or ice-dammed lakes frequently occur, posing catastrophic threats to the safety of life and property in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan regions, affecting countries like China, India, and Nepal. Therefore, with the deepening of global change research, studies on glacier changes (including area, thickness, and ice reserves) are becoming increasingly important, with significant implications for global water resources and climate change, as well as disaster warning."

However, due to the lack of ground glacier survey data for verification, and the \"change noise\" existing between multi-source data classification results, there are still many challenges in the automatic mapping of glaciers and their changes.
