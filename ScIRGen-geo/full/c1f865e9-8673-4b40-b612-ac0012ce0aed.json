            "description": "The ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is highly fragile and vulnerable to the impacts of human activity. To foster sustainable development locally and globally, the creation of a high-precision dataset on human activity intensity (HAI) for the plateau is of great significance. We chose six representative indicators, including population density, GDP density, night light, grazing intensity, land use/cover, and road network, to construct the HAI dataset for the QTP from 2000 to 2020. Preprocessing involved outlier testing, projection conversion, and raster resampling, followed by normalization of all data scores to a 1-100 scale. By weighted summation of each layer, HAI dataset for the QTP (2000-2020) was obtained. The dataset includes HAI data in 2000, 2010, and 2020, as well as HAI change data during 2000-2020, with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The dataset is archived in .tif format, and consists of four data files with data size of 68.7 MB (Compressed into one file with 20.4 MB). The analysis paper based on the dataset was published at Earth’s Future.",
