            "description": "Fossils of the ursid Indarctos from Withlacoochee River 4A of Florida (late early Hemphillian North American Land Mammal\nAge, Hh2, ~ 7.5–6.5 Ma) represent the best sample of this genus in North America, including both craniodental and\npostcranial specimens, yet only the skull has been described. In this study, we describe the other material of this bear from\nthe same locality and review the records of Indarctos in North America. Indarctos from Withlacoochee River 4A has dental\ncharacters in accordance with those of typical Indarctos oregonensis, but has distinctly more slender postcranial bones.\nIndarctos from other localities of North America contains two morphs with regards to postcranial robustness, but lacks a\nclear geographic pattern. Indarctos from Withlacoochee River 4A shares traits with the Old World Indarctos zdanskyi and\nmay be its descendant in the New World. The machairodont from Withlacoochee River 4A shows typical characters (e.g.,\npresence of distinct P4 preparastyle and mandibular flange) that allow referral to Amphimachairodus rather than to Nimravides.\nIts morphology also shows a stronger affinity of this population to the Old World Amphimachairodus horribilis rather\nthan to Hh3 Amphimachairodus coloradensis. Previously, most North American records of Amphimachairodus were late\nHemphillian (Hh3–4, ~ 6.5–4.5 Ma), when it co-occurred with a different ursid, “Agriotherium.” The Withlacoochee River\n4A specimens provide evidence that Amphimachairodus dispersed from Asia during the Hh2. The special morphology of\nIndarctos and the presence of Amphimachairodus in a Hh2 fauna suggest that the environment had begun to change before\nthe significant fauna turnover between the early and late Hemphillian.",

Additionally, the presence of well-preserved cranial and postcranial specimens suggests effective burial processes that protected the fossils from extensive weathering or damage over millions of years.",
