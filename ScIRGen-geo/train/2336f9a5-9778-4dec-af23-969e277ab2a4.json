            "description": "China cloud-removal snow albedo product data set is raster data with a geospatial extent of 72 - 142E, 16 - 56N, using an equal latitude and longitude projection and a spatial resolution of 0.005°. The dataset covers the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2020 with a temporal resolution of 1 day. The data contains six elements: black sky albedo (Black_Sky_Albedo), white sky albedo (White_Sky_Albedo), solar zenith angle (Solar_Zenith_Angle), pixel-level cloud label (Cloud_Mask), pixel-level forest pixel (Forest_Mask) and pixel-level retrieval label (Abnormal_Mask). Black_Sky_Albedo records the black sky albedo calculated by retrieved, with as a calculation factor of 0.0001 and a data range of 0-10000. White_Sky_Albedo records the white sky albedo calculated by retrieved, with as a calculation factor of 0.0001 and a data range of 0-10000. Cloud_Mask records whether the pixel is cloud type, with a value of 0 indicating non-cloud and 1 indicating cloud. Forest_Mask records whether the pixel has been corrected as a forest type, with a value of 0 indicating that it has not been corrected and 1 indicating that it has been corrected. Abnormal_Mask records whether the retrieval of the black sky albedo and white sky albedo of the pixel is an anomaly of less than 0 or greater than 10000, with a value of 0 indicating a non-anomaly and 1 indicating an anomaly. ChinaSA was retrieved based on the MODIS land surface reflectance product MOD09GA, the snow cover product MOD10A1/MYD10A1 and the global digital elevation model SRTM. The snow albedo retrieval model was developed based on the ART model and produced using the GEE and local side interactions.",
