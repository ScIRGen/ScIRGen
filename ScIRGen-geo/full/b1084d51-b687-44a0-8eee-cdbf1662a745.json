            "description": "This data is the chronological, magnetic and grain size data of Maquqiao (MQQ) aeolian sequence in the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). We measured the magnetic susceptibility and grain size data of the profile at 2.5 cm intervals. AMS14C dating samples were tested in Peking University and Beta Analytic in Miami, United States. All the experimental analysis was completed at the Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University, China. The OSL ages were determined by an automated Ris√∏ TL/OSL DA-20 reader. The magnetic susceptibility was measured by Bartington MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter; The grain size data were measured by a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer; The bulk density data were determined by according to the oil-soaked method; The data show the variations of magnetic susceptibility and grain size of aeolian sequences in the eastern TP since the Holocene, which has important reference significance for the study of aeolian sand activities associated with desertification and serious land degradation in the eastern TP.",

                    "Answer": "The Bartington MS 2 is used for measuring magnetic susceptibility, while the Malvern Mastersizer 2000 is used for particle size distribution. Both methods provide different types of data crucial for understanding aeolian sediment sequences. The magnetic susceptibility measurement helps in identifying variations in magnetic properties, which can imply changes in environmental conditions, whereas particle size distribution gives insights into the sediment transport processes and energy conditions during deposition. Both are complementary, with magnetic susceptibility offering insights into mineralogical changes and particle size distribution providing a more direct understanding of sediment dynamics.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in accurately measuring magnetic susceptibility and grain size in aeolian sediment sequences on the eastern Tibetan Plateau are influenced by the need for precise equipment setup and calibration, such as using the Bartington MS 2 for magnetic susceptibility and the Malvern Mastersizer 2000 for grain size measurement. Additionally, the high-resolution sampling at 2.5 cm intervals requires meticulous attention to detail during data collection to ensure reliability and accuracy in reflecting environmental changes over the Holocene period.",

                    "Answer": "Different dating methods like AMS14C and OSL can impact the reliability and precision of chronological data in aeolian sediment sequences. AMS14C dating provides radiocarbon ages for organic material, while OSL dating measures the last time sediment grains were exposed to light. The combination of these methods can enhance chronological accuracy by cross-verifying ages and covering different timescales, but discrepancies between methods can also arise, potentially affecting interpretations of sediment deposition timelines in high-altitude regions such as the eastern Tibetan Plateau.",
