The sample points, with various underlying surface and depth were measured by PR2 probe in PR2 quadrate (3Grid×3Grid, 90m×90m) and PR2 line. \n    Observations were carried out from May 31 to Jul. 13, 2008 with exceptions on Jun. 6, 8, 10, 13, 21, 27, 28, 29, Jul. 3 and 12. Data were archived in Excel and Word file. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",

                    "Answer": "Soil moisture profiling in the context of hydrological experiments in arid regions refers to the process of measuring and analyzing the variation of soil moisture content at different soil depths across various surface types. This involves daily observations using instruments like PR2 to collect data at specified depths, such as 10cm, 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, 60cm, and 100cm, to understand the temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture. The data aids in the analysis of soil moisture dynamics and the development of inversion methods like the thermal inertia method.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using PR2 instruments involves measuring soil moisture at multiple depths (10cm, 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, 60cm, and 100cm) across a grid layout of 90m x 90m. This provides detailed depth variability and spatial coverage in a specific area. Other soil moisture measurement techniques might differ in the range of depths they can measure and may have different spatial resolution or coverage strategies, potentially affecting the granularity and comprehensiveness of the data collected.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of soil moisture measurements using PR2 instruments can be influenced by the type of land surface, such as alfalfa fields, barley fields, and saline-alkali land, as these different surfaces may affect the soil moisture readings at various depths like 10cm, 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, 60cm, and 100cm. Additionally, the spatial arrangement of measurement plots, such as the 3Grid×3Grid, 90m×90m area, and the specific days when measurements are not taken, can also play a role in influencing accuracy.",

The measurements are conducted in a dense observation area with a 3Grid×3Grid layout and along a transect crossing various surface types like alfalfa fields, barley fields, and saline-alkaline lands, providing spatial variability of soil moisture.",
