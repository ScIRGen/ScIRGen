            "description": "Reasonable carrying capacity, also known as theoretical carrying capacity, refers to the maximum number of domestic animals that can be carried by a certain grassland area in a certain period of time under the premise of moderate grazing (or mowing) and maintaining sustainable production of grassland to meet the needs of normal growth, reproduction and production of livestock. Based on the MODIS inversion data of forage yield (fresh weight, kg / hm2), the reasonable carrying capacity of grassland (sheep unit, mu / km2) was evaluated according to the code for calculation of grassland carrying capacity and grass livestock balance (DB 51 / t1480-2012) and calculation of reasonable carrying capacity of natural grassland (NY / T 635-2015), The time series is 2000-2019, and the spatial resolution is 250m. This data set can analyze the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the theoretical carrying capacity under the condition of rational utilization of grassland in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, evaluate the carrying capacity characteristics of grassland in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, and extract the overgrazing areas, which has important application value for ecological protection, monitoring and early warning of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The temporal patterns in reasonable livestock carrying capacity data from 2000 to 2019 can indicate changes in the sustainability and management practices of grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These patterns, derived from MODIS-based estimations of edible forage yield, reflect the grassland's ability to support livestock under sustainable grazing conditions. By analyzing these patterns, researchers can identify trends in grassland utilization, assess grassland carrying characteristics, and detect regions subject to overgrazing. Such insights are crucial for ecological protection, monitoring, and early warning systems on the plateau.",

The procedures involve assessing the edible forage production in terms of fresh weight (kg/hm2) and applying the guidelines from 'The Grassland Carrying Capacity and Grass-Livestock Balance Calculation Standard' (DB 51/T1480—2012) and 'The Calculation of Reasonable Livestock Carrying Capacity for Natural Grasslands' (NY/T 635—2015). This results in the estimation of the reasonable livestock carrying capacity in sheep units (MU/km2) over a temporal span from 2000 to 2019, with a spatial resolution of 250 meters.",
