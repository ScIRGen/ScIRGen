            "description": "This dataset contains the ground surface water (including liquid water, glacier and perennial snow) distribution in Qilian Mountain Area in 2020. The dataset was produced based on classical Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) extraction criterion and manual editing. Landsat images collected in 2020 were used as basic data for water index extraction. Sentinel-2 images and Google images were employed as reference data for adjusting the extraction threshold. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates and water area. Consisting of 1 season, the dataset has a temporal resolution of 1 year and a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±30 meter). The dataset directly reflects the distribution of water bodies within the Qilian Mountain in 2020, and can be used for quantitative estimation of water resource.",

                    "Answer": "The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a method used to extract water body distribution by enhancing the presence of water features while suppressing other land cover types. It involves the use of satellite imagery, such as Landsat images, and aids in identifying surface water bodies including liquid water, glaciers, and perennial snow. This index is part of the data collection process for mapping water bodies, providing an annual spatial resolution of 30 meters, and is further refined through manual correction and reference to Google and Sentinel-2 images.",

                    "Answer": "The factors that contribute to the accuracy and precision of extracting water body distribution using the NDWI method include the quality of the Landsat imagery data used as the original basis, the resolution of the spatial data (30 meters in this case), the effectiveness of manual corrections applied, and the reference data such as Google imagery and Sentinel-2 imagery that support the extraction process. The inclusion of these reference datasets helps refine the extraction by providing additional spectral information and validation points, while the choice of spatial and temporal resolution affects the granularity of the water body distribution that can be captured.",

This information can be used for quantitative estimation of water resources in the watershed, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and an annual temporal resolution, aiding in regional water resource management and planning.",

                    "Answer": "In the given field, the process involves utilizing Landsat imagery from 2020 of the Qilian Mountains region. The extraction of surface water bodies, glaciers, and perennial snow is achieved through the application of the classic Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), followed by manual correction methods. This approach ensures the accurate representation of these features. The reference data for this procedure includes Google imagery and Sentinel-2 imagery, which aid in enhancing the precision of the extraction. The final product is stored in shapefile format, incorporating attributes such as coordinates and water area, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a temporal resolution of one year.",
