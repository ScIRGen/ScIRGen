The data coordinates are temporarily an orthogonal coordinate system, where the origin of the coordinates is (155.00W, 54.90N ), the x+ azimuth is 150 degrees clockwise from the north , the y+ azimuth is 60 degrees clockwise from the north , and the z+ direction is vertical downwards, in kilometers. The data source method is a three-dimensional finite difference numerical simulation. The geophysical calculation is ensured after the subduction thermal regime reaches a steady state. The temperature field error range is ±50 degrees Celsius, and the velocity field error range is ±0.1cm/ yr. This data can be used to further analyze the geophysical field of the Alaska subduction zone.",
