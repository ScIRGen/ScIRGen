            "description": "The Sanjiangyuan National Park is an important ecological security barrier in China, with an important ecological status. Its ecological benefits are a priority in the construction of national parks. Based on the principles of scientificity, pertinence, accessibility, and quantifiability, this dataset selects six key evaluation indicators, including vegetation coverage, net primary productivity, water conservation, soil conservation, wind and sand fixation, and Shannon diversity index, to construct an indicator system for calculating the ecological efficiency index of the Three Rivers Source National Park. The vegetation coverage is calculated using a pixel binary model; The net primary productivity is achieved using the Light Energy Utilization Efficiency Model (ECLUE); The water source conservation amount is calculated using the precipitation storage method; The soil conservation amount is calculated using the modified General Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE); The amount of wind protection and sand fixation is calculated using the modified wind erosion equation RWEQ model; The Shannon Diversity Index was obtained using remote sensing monitoring data of land use. Based on the vegetation coverage, net primary productivity, water conservation, soil conservation, wind and sand fixation, and Shannon diversity index obtained from the above calculations, the entropy weight method and Analytic Hierarchy Process were comprehensively applied to calculate the weights of each indicator. Finally, the spatial distribution data of the ecological benefit index before (2010–2015) and after (2016–2020) the pilot implementation of the Three Rivers Source National Public Park System were calculated.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of calculating ecological benefit index spatial distribution, the 'entropy weight method' refers to a technique used to determine the weight of each evaluation index based on the degree of information each index provides. It involves calculating the entropy of each index, which measures the uncertainty or disorder associated with it, to assign weights that reflect the relative importance of each index in the overall evaluation. This method is applied in combination with the analytic hierarchy process to integrate various ecological indicators into a comprehensive index.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method for vegetation coverage uses a pixel dichotomy model, while net primary productivity is calculated using the light use efficiency model (EC-LUE). The pixel dichotomy model focuses on direct measurements of vegetation cover, which might be easier to acquire but may not capture productivity dynamics as effectively as the EC-LUE model. The EC-LUE model, on the other hand, incorporates light energy utilization for estimating productivity, potentially offering more accurate insights into ecological benefits but requiring more complex data inputs and processing.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating multiple ecological indicators like vegetation coverage, net primary productivity, water conservation capacity, soil retention, wind erosion control, and Shannon diversity index allows for a comprehensive assessment of the ecological benefits in a national park. This integration can result in a more accurate and holistic understanding of the spatial distribution of ecological benefits. By using methods such as the entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weights of these indicators, the ecological benefit index can reflect the combined impact of these factors on the ecosystem, providing valuable insights into how different ecological functions contribute to the overall ecological health of the park.",

Vegetation coverage is calculated using the pixel dichotomy model; net primary productivity is achieved with the light use efficiency model (EC-LUE); water conservation is calculated using the precipitation storage method; soil retention is measured through the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE); windbreak and sand fixation are calculated using the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model; and the Shannon diversity index is obtained through land use remote sensing monitoring data. These indicators are then integrated using entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process to calculate the ecological benefit index spatial distribution before and after a specific time period.",
