            "description": "This data set contains the observation data of 10 m tower eddy covariance instrument from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. The site is located in donghuayuan Town, Huailai County, Hebei Province. The longitude and latitude of the observation point are 115.7880e, 40.3491n and 480m above sea level. The acquisition frequency of the eddy correlator is 10Hz, the height of the frame is 5m, the ultrasonic direction is due north, and the distance between the ultrasonic anemometer (csat3) and the CO2 / H2O analyzer (li7500a) is 15cm.\nThe released data is 30 minutes data obtained by post-processing the original collected 10Hz data by eddypro software. The main processing steps include: outlier value elimination, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction. At the same time, the quality evaluation of each flux value is mainly the test of atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). The 30 min flux values output after processing were also screened: (1) the data of instrument error; (2) the data of 1 h before and after precipitation; (3) the data of 10 Hz original data missing more than 10% every 30 min; (4) the observation data of weak turbulence at night (U * less than 0.1 M / s) were eliminated. The average period of observation data is 30 minutes. There are 48 data in a day, and the missing data is marked as - 6999. From May 27 to July 22, the data was missing due to problems with the ultrasonic anemometer.\nThe observational data released by eddy correlator include date / time, wind direction WDIR (°), horizontal wind speed wnd (M / s) and standard deviation of lateral wind speed STD_ Uy (M / s), ultrasonic virtual temperature TV (k), water vapor density H2O (g / m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg / m3), friction velocity ustar (M / s), obuhof length, sensible heat flux HS (w / m2), latent heat flux Le (w / M2), carbon dioxide flux FC (mg / (M2S)), quality identification of sensible heat flux QA_ HS, quality identification of latent heat flux QA_ LE。 The quality identification of sensible heat, latent heat and carbon dioxide flux can be divided into three levels (quality mark 0: (Δ st < 30, ITC < 30); 1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100); the rest are 2). The meaning of data time, for example, 0:30 represents the average of 0:00-0:30; the data is stored in *.

Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness only in the range of tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), compared to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS can better match the pixel scale of satellite imagery and the grid scale of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth for the pixel/grid scale of remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."

                    "Answer": "Large Aperture Scintillometers (LAS) can complement eddy covariance systems by measuring surface fluxes over larger spatial scales, ranging from several hundred meters to a few kilometers. LAS can be used in conjunction with remote sensing models and numerical weather prediction models to provide ground reference values for model optimization and validation.",
