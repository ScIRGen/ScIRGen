It is an important indicator to measure the overall economic situation of a country. The source data of economic development degree comes from Matti. After cutting the data and obtaining the data of the main urban area of Yangon deep water port, downscaling processing is carried out to reduce the resolution of the data to 10m level. The data of economic development degree can be used to measure the development degree of Yangon deep water port area, and can be used in urban planning, election, risk assessment, disaster relief, disease prevention and control, poverty alleviation and other fields.",

                "To ensure that our gridded end-products cover the entire land area included in the input datasets, we created a seamless administrative raster file using national (and in some cases also autonomous areas such as Greenland) and sub-national boundaries, and two population datasets (see Table 2). We first expanded the rasterized national and sub-national boundaries to cover NoData areas (such as sea areas and other water bodies) with a 2 arc-degree buffer, using the Euclidean Allocation tool in ArcMap 9.2. Next, we created a land mask by combining cells from both population datasets used, and national boundary data. This land mask was then used to set non-land cells to NoData. To compile the GDP per capita (PPP) dataset (Data Citation 1), we first put together a full national GDP dataset, drawn from the most recent World Bank Development Indicators database 32. For missing countries (see Supplementary Information), we used data from the CIA’s World Factbook 33, except for one administrative unit, namely French Southern Territories, for which no data was found and regional average data was used (see below). The constant 2015 international US dollars of CIA fact sheets were converted to constant 2011 international US dollars, the unit in which national GDP from World Bank was given. For that we used the standard method documented by the World Bank39. Temporal interpolation followed the same method as for national values. The data were extrapolated over time by scaling the last available value to reflect subsequent national changes, and similarly scaling the first value with preceding changes. After deriving both national and sub-national tabulated data, we first created a raster dataset of these two spatial scales for each time step, and then combined the two raster datasets, which resulted in the final GDP per capita (PPP) raster dataset provided here. To estimate the total GDP (PPP) of each grid cell, we multiplied the GDP per capita (PPP) by grid specific population data using two different spatial resolutions: 5 arc-min (10 km at equator) (Data Citation 1) and 30 arc-sec (1 km at equator) (Data Citation 1). To compile the HDI dataset (Data Citation 1), we first produced a full national HDI dataset, based on the data from the Human Development Reports by UNDP 30 (Table 3). After deriving both national and sub-national tabulated data, we first created raster datasets of these two scales for each time step, and then combined the two rasters, resulting in the final HDI raster dataset provided here. To estimate the error originating from the interpolation and extrapolation to fill the missing data entries, we performed an error analysis separately for national and sub-national level data."

                    "Answer": "To ensure consistency over time and space, sub-national data are used indirectly by scaling reported national values to remain representative of official statistics. The data are extrapolated over time by scaling the last available value to reflect subsequent national changes and similarly scaling the first value with preceding changes.",

                    "Answer": "To estimate total GDP (PPP) for each grid cell, GDP per capita (PPP) is multiplied by grid-specific population data using two different spatial resolutions: 5 arc-min (10 km at the equator) and 30 arc-sec (1 km at the equator). This method involves creating raster datasets of both national and sub-national scales for each time step and then combining them to produce the final dataset.",

                    "Answer": "To ensure seamless integration, a seamless administrative raster file is created using national and sub-national boundaries, along with two population datasets. This involves expanding the rasterized boundaries to cover NoData areas with a buffer and creating a land mask by combining cells from population datasets and boundary data.",

This approach uses different spatial resolutions, such as 5 arc-min and 30 arc-sec, to ensure precision in the estimation process.",

These techniques involve scaling available values to reflect subsequent national changes and performing error analysis separately for national and sub-national level data to estimate the error originating from the interpolation and extrapolation process.",

                    "Answer": "Downscaling GDP data to a finer spatial resolution involves the challenge of accurately representing economic activities at a local level, which are originally provided at national or sub-national scales. This process requires interpolation and extrapolation, which can introduce errors, especially when filling missing data entries, as mentioned in the error analysis performed for both national and sub-national data.",

For instance, total GDP (PPP) is provided with both 5 arc-min and 30 arc-sec resolutions to accommodate different analysis needs, such as global overviews or more detailed local assessments. This approach also helps in effectively utilizing grid-specific population data to estimate GDP per capita accurately.",

This is important for maintaining the integrity of spatial analyses and assessments. By expanding boundaries to cover NoData areas and setting non-land cells to NoData, the datasets remain representative of official statistics and are not skewed by missing data in areas such as water bodies.",
