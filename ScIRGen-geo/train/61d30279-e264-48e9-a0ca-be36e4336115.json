            "description": "Biological productivity refers to the material production capacity of organisms and their groups or even larger scale (including ecosystem and biosphere). It changes with the environment. Therefore, it becomes an indicator of environmental change and the health of the earth system. Net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation refers to the remaining part of total organic matter (GPP) produced by photosynthesis of green plants in unit time unit area after deducting autotrophic respiration (RA). The NPP products in Heihe River Basin mainly focus on the important parameters par and FPAR of the model of light energy utilization, and improve the algorithm and product production. The FPAR inversion model that distinguishes the direct radiation from the scattered radiation and the par inversion method based on the combination of static and polar orbit satellites are proposed. Finally, the net primary productivity data set of Heihe River Basin is produced by using the light utilization model. The algorithm improves the temporal and spatial resolution of data products, and the accuracy of products is also significantly improved.",

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
