Traditionally, water resources assessment and management have put emphasis on blue water, ignoring green water. Conceptually, water can be divided into green water and blue water. Blue water is the water in rivers, lakes, wetland and shallow aquifers, while green water is precipitation water stored in unsaturated soil, and later used for evapotranspiration. Although green water is often ignored, it plays an essential role in crop production and other ecosystem services."

The Av-SW A T interface was used for the setup and parameterization of the model. The entire river basin was divided into 303 HRUs and 34 sub-basins on the basis of the digital elevation model (DEM). The SW A T model of the Heihe river basin was calibrated and validated using monthly river discharges for two upstream stations where human activities are not intensive. The simulation period was from 1977 to 2004. The SUFI-2 method in the SW A T-CUP interface was used for parameter optimization."

Blue water ﬂows are larger in upstream sub-basins than in downstream sub-basins mainly due to high precipitation and a large amount of snow and melting water in upstream. Green water ﬂows are distributed more homogeneously among different sub-basins. The green water coefﬁcient was 87 %–89 % in the 2000s for the entire river basin, varying from around 80 %–90 % in up- and mid-stream sub-basins to above 90 % in downstream sub-basins."

                    "Answer": "The goal is to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of green and blue water in the entire Heihe river basin under natural conditions, which is essential for effective water resource assessment and management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions.",

                    "Answer": "To simulate blue and green water flows using the SWAT model, the process involves setting up and parameterizing the model using the Av-SWAT interface and dividing the river basin into HRUs and sub-basins based on a digital elevation model (DEM). Calibration and validation of the model are performed using monthly river discharges from upstream stations where human activities are minimal. The SUFI-2 method in the SWAT-CUP interface is used for parameter optimization during the simulation period from 1977 to 2004.",

                    "Answer": "The SWAT model requires the integration of DEM, land use, soil, climate, and other management data to simulate hydrological processes. The DEM helps in dividing the river basin into HRUs and sub-basins, while land use and soil data inform the characterization of the landscape. Climate data from 19 weather stations, including daily records of precipitation and temperature, are used to drive the model simulations. Management data provide additional context for human interventions in the basin.",

The lack of available data for downstream segments can complicate the validation process, necessitating reliance on data from less impacted upstream stations to ensure the model's accuracy in simulating natural hydrological processes.",

The daily climate input data (precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature) for the period of 1977–2004 were obtained from the Heihe Data Research Group and China Meteorological Data Sharing Services System.",

Validation is achieved by calibrating the model at specific hydrological stations that represent a significant portion of the basin's discharge and are less affected by human activities.",
