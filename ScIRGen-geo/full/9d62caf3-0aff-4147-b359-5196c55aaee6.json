            "description": "Modern pollen dataset is essential for investigating the relationships between pollen and vegetation and climate, and for the pollen-based past vegetation and climate quantitative reconstructions. Asia has various landform types, climate systems and vegetation types, however, researches on pollen modern processes in Asia are generally restricted at regional scale, hitherto, an entire modern pollen dataset absent in Asia. Based on previous pollen data collection and modern pollen analysis (for special regions), authors have established a modern pollen dataset for Asia initially. The modern pollen dataset including 9165 sampling sites with 245 pollen taxa (at genus and family level), covering evenly the most of parts of Asia. This modern pollen dataset can be utilized in pollen-based past vegetation and climate reconstructions at board spatial-scale, and in reliability assessing for vegetation and climate models. The modern pollen dataset is relative to the literature: Cao, X., Tian, F., Herzschuh, U., Ni, J., Xu, Q., Li, W., Zhang, Y., Luo, M., Chen, F., 2022. Human activities have reduced plant diversity in eastern China over the last two millennia, Global Change Biology (accepted). More detail on processing is provided in this literature.",

Pollen percentages were interpolated for 116 time slices at 100-year intervals between 11.5 and 0 cal. ka BP using the interp.dataset function (method = linear) in the rioja package for R. DCA and PCA were performed for each time slice using the decorana and rda functions in the vegan package.

                    "Answer": "The data collection involved gathering modern pollen data from various regions, including China, Mongolia, central Asia, Japan, southeastern Russia, and the Tibetan Plateau.

                    "Answer": "One of the challenges is the regional differences in human–vegetation interactions, which may lead to contradictions in pollen data interpretations. Addressing these requires taxonomically harmonizing and temporally standardizing fossil pollen datasets and considering regional land-use types (e.g., crop cultivation and grazing) to improve the robustness of human impact assessments.",

                    "Answer": "The significant regional differences in Asia's landforms, climate, and vegetation pose challenges in constructing a comprehensive dataset.

                    "Answer": "The contradictions in pollen data and pollen-based reconstructions imply that these datasets may not provide robust evidence for human impacts on vegetation. This could be due to regional differences in the history of human-vegetation interactions, suggesting that the datasets might not fully capture the complex interplay between human activities and vegetation changes.",

However, it requires careful standardization and harmonization of data to ensure compatibility and accuracy.",
