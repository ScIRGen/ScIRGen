Qomolangma, and the Integrated Observation and Research Station of the Alpine Environment in Southeast Tibet. The data have three resolutions, which include 0.1 seconds, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 24 hours. \nThe temperature, humidity and pressure sensors used in the field atmospheric boundary layer tower (PBL) were provided by Vaisala of Finland. The wind speed and direction sensor was provided by MetOne of the United States. The radiation sensor was provided by APPLEY of the United States and EKO of Japan. Gas analysis instrument was provided by Licor of the United States, and the soil moisture content, ultrasonic anemometer and data collector were provided by CAMPBELL of the United States. The observing system is maintained by professionals on a regular basis (2-3 times a year), the sensors are calibrated and replaced, and the collected data are downloaded and reorganized to meet the meteorological observation specifications of the National Weather Service and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\nThe data set was processed by forming a time continuous sequence after the raw data were quality-controlled, and the quality control included eliminating the systematic error caused by missing data and sensor failure.",

The thermal effects of the giant plateau on the atmosphere greatly influence circulations over China, eastern Asia and even the globe. The plateau absorbs a large proportion of solar radiation (some of which is redistributed by cryospheric processes) and undergoes dramatic seasonal changes of surface heat and water fluxes. The lack of quantitative understanding of interactions between the land surface and atmosphere makes it difficult to understand and model the complete energy and water cycles over the Tibetan Plateau and their effects on global climate change. Therefore, the number of atmosphere-land interaction studies over the Tibetan Plateau has been increased in recent years."

The diurnal variations of the turbulent fluxes are different during the dry period (pre-monsoon period) and wet period (inside monsoon period). The diurnal variation of momentum flux over the northern Tibetan Plateau area during the dry period is also obvious, increasing in the morning to its maximum in the afternoon, and then decreasing. Sensible heat flux H and latent heat flux LE vary by less than 10% of their magnitude with height over the flat prairie area of Naqu area of the northern Tibetan Plateau. The land surface is a very strong heating source in the day time, it is a weak surface heating sink in the night, but the daily mean is strong surface heating source. The diurnal variation of CO2 flux in summer is obvious over the alpine meadow surface of Mt. Everest area. The plateau ABL can extend to heights of almost 3 km above the ground surface in Naqu area of the northern Tibetan Plateau, and is characterized by a well-mixed layer of potential temperature. The convection over the Tibetan Plateau evolves from dry shallow convection in the morning to wet deep convection in the afternoon.
