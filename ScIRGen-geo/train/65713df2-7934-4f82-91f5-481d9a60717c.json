            "description": "This data is the whole rock major and trace element data, zircon u-pb dating data and zircon Lu Hf isotope data of granite in nagarparkar area, southeast Pakistan. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the data obtained, we can analyze the formation period and environment, and conclude that they may be Rodinia supercontinent remnants.",
