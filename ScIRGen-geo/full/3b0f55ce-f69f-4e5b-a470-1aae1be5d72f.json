            "description": "The active layer is one of the main characteristics of permafrost. It melts in warm season and freezes in cold season, showing seasonal changes. The change of ground temperature of active layer will directly affect the change of temperature of permafrost, thus affecting the stability of permafrost.The monitoring station of this data set is located at 92 °E, 35 ° N, with an elevation of 4,600 M. The monitoring site is flat, the vegetation type is alpine meadow, and the monitoring instrument is DT500 series data acquisition instrument. The monitoring of ground temperature is carried out at 5 depths below the surface, 10 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm, 80 cm and 160cm respectively. The time interval of this data set is 1 day, which is the average value of data once every 30 minutes.Data are stable and continuous during the period.Scientific subjects such as thermal change process and change mechanism of active layer are carried out by combining data of soil heat flux and soil moisture.",

This data collection method can reveal variations in ground temperature, which directly affects permafrost stability. By analyzing data from different depths, researchers can better comprehend the heat transfer processes and identify changes in soil thermal conductivity and moisture content, which are crucial for modeling permafrost response to climate change.",
