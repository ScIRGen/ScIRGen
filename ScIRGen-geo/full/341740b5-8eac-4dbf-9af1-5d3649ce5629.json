These sensors are part of multi-parameter water quality instruments like YSIEXO or HACH, which are submerged 10-20 centimeters below the lake surface. The comparison in terms of accuracy and applicability would depend on the specific sensor calibration and environmental conditions, but both measurements utilize similar technologies and principles.",
