Previous studies have found that the magnitude of interception loss of vegetation is in the range of 8–40% of annual gross rainfall according to field observations. Consequently, models ignoring interception loss of vegetation may underestimate ET from vegetated land. Until now, many studies on the interception loss have focused on field scale. These methods or achievements cannot be used directly at basin scales, since land surface is often characterized as heterogeneous and the spatial distribution of vegetation is complex at this scale."

The products of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 Version 7 (V7), with a temporal resolution of 3-hour and a spatial resolution of 0.25◦ were used as precipitation data. The interception loss was measured at two forest experimental sites in Heihe River Basin from June to September in 2008. An Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion image with a resolution of 30 m on June 15, 2008 was used to calculate the fraction of forest in the MODIS pixel covering the experimental site for validation study."

At annual scale, the interception ratio could be treated as a stable indicator for long-term water balance research.
