            "description": "This dataset includes data obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Meteorological elements of Huailai station between January 1 and December 31, 2022. The site (115.7880° E, 40.3491° N) was located on a maize surface, which is near Donghuayuan Town of Huailai city in Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (5 m, north), wind speed and direction profile (10 m, north), air pressure (in the box), rain gauge (10 m), four-component radiometer (5 m, south), two infrared temperature sensors (5 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (-0.06 m), soil temperature profile (0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), soil moisture profile (-0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), and a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (-0.02, -0.04 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m; RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content), and average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2022-6-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "An automatic meteorological station for observing surface fluxes and meteorological elements typically includes components and variables such as air temperature and relative humidity sensors at 5 meters, wind speed and direction sensors at 10 meters, pressure sensors, rain gauges, and four-component radiometers. It also involves soil temperature and moisture probes at various depths, soil heat flux plates, and instruments for measuring surface radiation temperature. Data collection is performed at a frequency of 30 seconds with output every 10 minutes, and includes quality control measures to ensure data integrity.",

The underlying surface is irrigated cornfields. The collected elements include air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, four-component radiation, surface radiation temperature, soil heat flux, and soil moisture and temperature at multiple depths. This setup may vary from those in regions with forests or urban areas, where different underlying surfaces might affect the choice of instruments, data collection frequency, and the types of meteorological elements prioritized for observation.",

Additionally, consistent formatting of date and time is necessary to maintain data integrity.",

                    "Answer": "Aggregating high-frequency data collected every 30 seconds into a 10-minute interval can lead to a reduction in data granularity, potentially smoothing out short-term fluctuations and extreme values. This may result in a more stable dataset, but it could also obscure important transient events or rapid changes in the atmospheric conditions. Additionally, careful data processing and quality control measures, such as removing duplicate records and outliers, are necessary to maintain data integrity and accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods using automatic weather stations at different heights, like 10m towers, could face challenges in maintaining consistent data quality and completeness due to factors such as equipment malfunctions leading to data gaps, which are marked by -6999. Additionally, data that are physically implausible or outside the instrument's range are excluded, which could affect the dataset's completeness. Furthermore, there is a need for rigorous quality control processes to ensure that repeated records are removed and that data are uniformly formatted in terms of date and time.",
