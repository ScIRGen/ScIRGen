            "description": "This data set mainly includes the results of Si isotopic analysis of Jurassic to Cretaceous metamorphic peridotites from the east coast of California, USA. the specific sampling location is 35 n °~ thirty-six °， West longitude 121 °~ one hundred and twenty-two °。 The samples include partial serpentinized peridotite, complete serpentinized peridotite and talc serpentinized serpentinite. The Si isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation. After the sample was digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin, the silicon isotope was measured by MC-ICPMS, and the international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. The Si isotopic composition of plate fluid in the complex is close to that of mantle peridotite. During the process of metamorphism and dehydration, the Si isotopic composition of the residual subducted plate may not change obviously. The test was completed from January 1, 2018 to May 1, 2019.",

                    "Answer": "The method described involves the use of MC-ICPMS for Si isotope analysis after samples have undergone acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation. This approach is likely selected for its precision and ability to handle complex matrices typical of metamorphic peridotites. Comparatively, other techniques might not offer the same level of accuracy or sensitivity, particularly when dealing with isotopic compositions close to mantle values, as suggested by the dataset's focus on monitoring with standard samples.",

                    "Answer": "The Si isotope data from metamorphic peridotites are collected and analyzed by first sampling the rocks, which include partially serpentinized peridotites, fully serpentinized peridotites, and talc-altered serpentinites, from specific geographic coordinates (35°N to 36°N, 121°W to 122°W). The whole rock samples undergo acid digestion followed by ion exchange resin separation. Subsequently, the Si isotopes are tested using MC-ICPMS, with international standard samples used to monitor the test data. This method ensures the accuracy and consistency of the Si isotope analysis.",
