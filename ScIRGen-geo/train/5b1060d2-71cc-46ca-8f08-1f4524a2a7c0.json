            "description": "On 4 July 2012 (UTC+8), a TASI sensor boarded on the Y-12 aircraft was used to obtain the thermal-infrared hyperspectral image, which is located in the observation experimental area, Linze region and Heihe riverway. The relative flight altitude is 1000 meters. The wavelength of TASI is 8-11.5 μm  with a spatial resolution of 3 meters. \nThrough the ground sample points and atmospheric data, the data are recorded in surface radiance processed by geometric correction  and atmospheric correction. Land surface temperature (LST) data was retrieved by temperature/emissivity separation algorithm.",
