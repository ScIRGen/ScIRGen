            "description": "ChinaHighO3 is one of the series of long-term, full-coverage, high-resolution, and high-quality datasets of ground-level air pollutants for China (i.e., ChinaHighAirPollutants, CHAP). It is generated from the big data (e.g., ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations) using artificial intelligence by considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of air pollution. This is the big data-derived seamless (spatial coverage = 100%) daily, monthly, and yearly 1 km (i.e., D1K, M1K, and Y1K) ground-level maximum 8-hour average (MDA8) O3 dataset in China from 2000 to present. This dataset yields a high quality with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.89 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.77 µg m-3 on a daily basis. Note that this dataset is continuously updated, and if you want to apply for more data or have any questions, please contact me (Email: weijing_rs@163.com; weijing@umd.edu).",

                "Ozone (O3) is an important trace and greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, posing a threat to the ecological environment and human health at the ground level. Tropospheric O3 (< 12 km above the ground) is mainly produced by anthropogenic activities, affecting radiative forcing at a global scale with implications on climate change. Exposure to high surface O3 levels is highly related to increased human health risks, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It also affects the ecosystem and agricultural production, e.g., inhibiting plant growth, promoting leaf senescence, and affecting crop yields. Since the middle of the twentieth century, many countries around the world have observed tropospheric and ground-level O3. In 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Environment and Ecology (MEE) established a national air quality observation network to monitor real-time O3, particulate matter (PM), and other near-surface air pollutants. However, the construction and maintenance of ground networks require substantial manpower and material resources. Satellite remote sensing can make up for such a deficiency by providing spatially continuous atmospheric O3 distributions. Near-surface O3 typically accounts for only a few percent of total column O3, and the retrieval sensitivity to near-surface O3 from ultraviolet measurements is limited. It is thus particularly difficult to extract near-surface O3 concentrations from satellite measurements."

The unique advantage of the full coverage of our dataset allowed us to accurately capture a short-term severe O3 pollution exposure event that took place from 23 April to 8 May in 2020. Also, a rapid increase and recovery of O3 concentrations associated with variations in anthropogenic emissions were seen during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. Trends in O3 concentration showed an average growth rate of 2.49 μg/m3/yr (p < 0.001) from 2013 to 2020, along with the continuous expansion of polluted areas exceeding the daily O3 standard (i.e., MDA8 O3 = 160 μg/m3). Summertime O3 concentrations and the probability of occurrence of daily O3 pollution have significantly increased since 2015, especially in the North China Plain and the main air pollution transmission belt (i.e., the “2 + 26” cities). However, a decline in both was seen in 2020, mainly due to the coordinated control of air pollution and ongoing COVID-19 effects."
