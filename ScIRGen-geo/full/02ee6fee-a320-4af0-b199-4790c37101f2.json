            "description": "This dataset includes boundary and topographic data of Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP):\n1. SETP_ Boundary: we centered on the traditional SETP region (i.e., the Parlung Tsangpo River basin or Bomi County) and used the surrounding river network (e.g., the Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra River, Nujiang-Salween River, and their tributaries) to delineate the boundary of the SETP. This region covers the Eastern Nyainqentanglha Ranges, Eastern Himalayas, and Western Hengduan Mountains and hosts the largest maritime glacier concentration across China.\n2. Topographic data: Based on NASADEM provided by NASA Earthdata, we mosaicked the DEM, slope, aspect, profile curvature (profc) and water Mask (SWB) of SETP.\n3. Hillshade: We produced the hillshde with a altitude angle of 45° from the NASADEM of SETP.",
            "instructions": "The boundary is stored as SHP file and the topographic data is stored as TIFF file.\nThe boundary and topographic data were uploaded separately. These who are interested in it can download on demand.",

This is followed by deriving additional terrain data such as slope, aspect, and profile curvature through analytical processes. The water body mask is also generated through similar data processing techniques. Furthermore, surface analysis is conducted to produce a hillshade data with a 45° altitude angle, enhancing the topographical representation.",
