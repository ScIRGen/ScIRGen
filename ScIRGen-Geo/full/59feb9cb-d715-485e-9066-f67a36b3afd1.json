      "description": "The West Kunlun region forms the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and sedimentation in this region contributed to plateau formation and its northwards expansion, as well as the development of central Asian aridification. However, the stratigraphic dating framework in this region has been ambiguous, hampering the understanding of both tectonic and environmental evolution. Here, palynological analysis was performed on the Xialafudie Formation in the West Kunlun region. Together with the palynological assemblage and megafossils found in the study section, as well as regional stratigraphic comparison, we conclude that the Xialafudie Formation was deposited during the Pliocene, and not Early Cretaceous as previously reported. The palynological assemblage of the section is mainly composed of drought-tolerant herbs and shrubs, and the percentage of conifers and broadleaved trees is very low, indicating that a dry and cold environment prevailed in the West Kunlun region during the Pliocene. Comprehensively analysed palynological data from the Tarim Basin and its surroundings show that aridification intensified in this part of central Asia during the Pliocene, as a result of long-term global cooling and regional tectonism.",

        "The West Kunlun region forms the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and sedimentation in this region contributed to plateau formation and its northwards expansion, as well as the development of central Asian aridification. However, the stratigraphic dating framework in this region has been ambiguous, hampering the understanding of both tectonic and environmental evolution. Located in the continent interior, and bounded to the south by the Tibetan Plateau and to the north by the central Asian mountains, northwest China has become one of the hyper-arid regions in the world, and contains one of the world’s largest deserts. It provides a major dust source for the global aerosol system, affects biogeochemical cycles and water resources and plays an important role in dust-climate feedbacks. However, the timing of the formation and subsequent evolution of this arid environment are still debated. Estimates for when aridification began range from the Eocene to the Pliocene. The rain shadow of the Tibetan Plateau, Pamir, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountains, long-term global cooling, and retreat of the Paratethys are all envisaged to have enhanced the aridification of the Asian interior and the formation of the Taklamakan Desert. Few researchers have paid attention to the environmental changes in the West Kunlun region because of the chaotic stratigraphic age constraints, hampering the understanding of the evolution of aridification in the Asian interior. Researchers can use palynomorphs to determine the relative stratigraphic age, especially when other dating methods such as radiometric isotopes in volcanic ash, palaeomagnetism and mammalian stratigraphy can be or cannot be applied. Palynological analysis is also a good proxy to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment."

Then, we have selected one of the fossil sites to collect pollen samples because this section is not very steep and easier to obtain continuous samples. Field work was conducted in the Waqia area, Tashkurgan County, in 2018. At the same time, 60 palynological samples were collected at 0.5 m intervals. Four modern top-soil pollen samples were also collected near the section for comparison. All pollen samples were prepared using the standard pollen preparation method, including 10% HCl, 10% NaOH and 40% HF. Then, a 10-μm mesh was used to remove the fine fraction and concentrate pollen by ultrasonic sieving. Identifications were based on atlases of pollen and spores, as well as modern reference slides from the collection of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). All samples were counted to a terrestrial pollen sum of 300 pollen grains. Pollen and spore percentages were calculated based on the sum of terrestrial pollen. Palynological diagrams were illustrated using the software packages TILIA and TILIAGRAPH and pollen assemblage zones were constructed using CONISS."
