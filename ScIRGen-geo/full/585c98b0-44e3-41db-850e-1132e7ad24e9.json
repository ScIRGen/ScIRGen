            "description": "Although some paleomagnetic data have been accumulated in the surrounding areas of the Tibetan Plateau in recent ten years, most of them come from the Himalayan region, such as Nepal and Kashmir (kloot Wijk et al., 1985; 1986a, b), or near Lhasa (besse et al., 1984).\nKekexili area is completely a blank area for paleomagnetic research. The team collected 57 paleomagnetic directional samples from the outcropped strata of Precambrian, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous according to the occurrence factor method.\nThis data set mainly records the paleomagnetic data of these specimens.\nThe data set of Kekexili area comes from the collection and indoor research of the scientific research team in this book, and the paleomagnetic results of Kekexili adjacent area (1989, Zhai Yongjian et al.)\nThe results of international multidisciplinary geoscience research projects, such as the geodynamics project and later lithosphere project, show that paleomagnetism can give the paleolatitude and paleoorientation of the studied blocks in geological history, which is one of the important means of global paleogeographic reconstruction and tectonic evolution.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method in the Hoh Xil region involves using rock layer attitudes to collect paleomagnetic samples, specifically targeting Pre-Cambrian, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous strata. This contrasts with other regions like the Himalayas, where paleomagnetic data has been accumulated over the past decade, often focusing on different geological contexts and possibly utilizing varied techniques. The Hoh Xil region remains a blank area in paleomagnetic research, indicating unique challenges and opportunities in data collection compared to the more extensively studied areas in the Himalayas.",

                    "Answer": "The ultimate goal of collecting paleomagnetic data from the Hoh Xil region and its neighboring areas is to fill the research gap in paleomagnetism for this region, which is a blank area, and to provide essential data for global paleogeographic reconstruction and tectonic evolution studies. This can help determine the paleolatitude and paleoorientation of geological blocks during historical periods, contributing valuable insights to international multidisciplinary geoscience projects like the geodynamics and lithosphere programs.",
