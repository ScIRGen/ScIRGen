            "description": "The dataset is the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) products of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the FVC equation which is based on dimidiate pixel model of NDVI.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.FVC is an important ecological parameter, which is widely used in ecological environmnet monitoring .",
            "instructions": "1) File name rules: the FVC result of each scense is stored in a floder including the FVC band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-FVC; the FVC is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\". 2) How to use the dataset:the FVC results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the unit of the FVC results is %, for exmaple the value is 80, that means the fractional vegetation is 80%, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "The NDVI-based pixel dichotomy model is a method used to estimate vegetation coverage from satellite imagery. It involves using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to differentiate between vegetated and non-vegetated areas within each pixel of satellite data, allowing for the calculation of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC). This approach is applied to surface reflectance datasets obtained from Landsat series satellites to derive vegetation coverage products.",

                    "Answer": "The NDVI-based pixel dichotomy model is used to retrieve vegetation coverage from Landsat satellite surface reflectance data, allowing researchers to infer the percentage of ground covered by vegetation. This model helps interpret the distribution and density of vegetation by analyzing the contrast between vegetated and non-vegetated pixels, thereby improving the accuracy of vegetation coverage estimation.",
