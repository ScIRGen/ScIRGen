There are 24 species of pitvipers in Qinghai Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas, belonging to 8 genera. The number of species distributed accounts for 67% of the total number of pitvipers in China, and 7 species are endemic to the region. In Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and Tibet, there are 13 species of pitvipers in Yunnan, and 7 species in Tibet and Chongqing. The data set can provide important data for the biodiversity catalogue of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas.",
