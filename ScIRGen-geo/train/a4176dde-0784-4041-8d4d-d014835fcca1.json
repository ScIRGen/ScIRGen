The procedure includes analyzing these datasets to capture the current state of ice lakes with an area greater than 0.01 km². The data is then processed to define attributes like lake type, orientation, width, area, depth, and length. The projection parameters used are Lambert conformal conic with Everest (India 1956) ellipsoid and India (India, Sikkim) datum, ensuring accurate spatial representation in the Tista Basin area.",
