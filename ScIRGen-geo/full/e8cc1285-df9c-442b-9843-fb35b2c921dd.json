            "description": "This dataset includes 842 organic matter and 899 grain size data from Dalongchi in the central Tianshan Mountains. Samples were taken at intervals of 1cm for the determination of organic matter and particle size. This dataset can be used to analyze climate conditions over the past millennium. The results suggest that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Modern Warm Period (CWP) had a dry climate, while the Little Ice Age (LIA) had a wet climate, which may be related to the influence of NAO and AMO. In addition, humidity oscillations are violent and unstable on multidecadal to century scales. Especially during the Little Ice Age, there were 4 wet periods and 3 dry periods. The influence of solar cycle and ENSO quasi-regular cycle should be emphasized in future hydroclimate prediction and climate simulation in arid Central Asia.",

                "Arid Central Asia (ACA), far away from the ocean, is not only one of the driest and largest inland regions worldwide, but also the birthplace of the far-reaching ancient civilizations that spread along the Silk Road. Scarce precipitation, intense evaporation, and fragile ecosystems render this region sensitive to abrupt changes in effective humidity. Arid Central Asia is primarily controlled by the prevailing westerlies. Proxy records from ACA are valuable for understanding the driving factors and processes of underlying hydroclimate evolution in the inland region, which provides useful reference for human adaptation to hydroclimate changes at present and into the future. On the sub-orbital scale, solar radiation controlled the intensity of the westerlies through the variation of the meridional radiation gradient between high and middle latitudes, thus having the dominant influence on moisture changes of ACA during the Holocene. In addition, the sub-orbital-scale hydroclimate changes are also related to the shift of the Subtropical High, the strength and position of the Siberian High, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) mode, and the changes of the Laurentide and Scandinavian Ice Sheets. In earlier studies, a humid climate during the MWP and a dry climate condition during the LIA was documented by the tree ring of Sabina przewalskii (Kom.). However, a growing body of studies based on the lacustrine sediments, ice cores, tree ring, and peat profiles show a generally similar climate pattern of a relatively dry MWP and a wet LIA in ACA over the last millennium. Many studies emphasize that internal climate variability (i.e., major sea and atmospheric modes) is supposed to be more marked than external factors (e.g., solar forcing) in influencing hydroclimate changes."

Then, we explore the contribution of internal climate variability (which mainly refers to the NAO, AMO, and ENSO in this study) and solar activity to humidity oscillations on different timescales over the past millennium. Our findings suggest that the effect of the solar cycle and the quasi-regular period of ENSO should be seriously evaluated for hydroclimate predictions and climate simulations in arid Central Asia in the future."

The DLC1819 core was subsampled at 1 cm intervals. All subsamples were stored in a freezer in our laboratory at a constant temperature of 4 ◦C and used for MS, grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) analyses. Samples for MS were dried at below 40 ◦C in a constant temperature air-blast drying oven and ground and packed into standard plastic boxes with a capacity of 2·2·2 cm3. A Bartington MS2 susceptibility meter was used to measure magnetic susceptibility. Samples used for grain size measurement were pretreated with 10–20 mL of 10 % H 2O2 to remove organic matter and then with 10 mL of 10 % HCl to remove carbonates; next, samples were rinsed with deionized water and finally treated with 10 mL 0.05 M (NaPO3)6 on an ultrasonic vibrator for 10 min to promote dispersion. Grain size distributions were determined using Malvern/MS 3000 laser grain size analyzer. The samples used for TOC and TN determination were decalcified with 10 % HCl and rinsed repeatedly with deionized water. Then, ∼3–5 mg dried and ground samples were analyzed using the EURO EA 3000 elemental analyzer."
