                "Tianshan Mountain System (TMS), one of the seven major mountain ranges in the world and west-to-east orientation, is located in the center region of Eurasia which is about 4000 m of average altitude, and extends across China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The TMS plays a pivotal implication in people’s lives owing to its abundant water resources, mineral resources, plant resources, and animal resources. Importantly, the glacier change is a direct result of climate change influenced by the meteorology. Consequently, the analysis of glacier surface meteorological elements of the Western Tianshan Mountain Station (WTMS) and Eastern Tianshan Mountain Station (ETMS) is one of the main contents of glacier-climate change research, which is not only important to reveal and discover the dynamic changes of microclimate in glacier regions. Many researchers had claimed the rapid impact on climate change in the recent years, and the reasons behind were natural as well as anthropogenic influences of pollutant sources (Akorede et al.2012). Climate change is likely to change the snow cover area and alter the water availability in the future making long-term water management more challenging (Khadka et al.2014). At the same time, the variation of meteorological parameters observed over the WTMS and ETMS is closely connected with the variation of climate change."

Further, the differences of meteorological parameters obtained from the WTMS and ETMS are delivered, and possible reasons are given which will provide a reference for the glacier surfaces responding to climate change in the context of global warming. Henceforth, the main purpose of this study is to verify the credibility of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in the Tianshan Mountains."

                "The meteorological data over the WTMS is still scarce due to lack of observations, even blank; and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data are relatively coarse which causes the large uncertainty for the credibility in this study area. However, some observational data are missing or not collected due to severe weather conditions and lack of human resources to maintain the instrument in time with unstable power. In particular, the lack of data in summer is very serious, it does not have typical representativeness, so this paper does not select the complete summer data for the analysis."

In addition, to understand the variations of meteorological elements near the snow surface between the eastward and westward Tianshan mountains, the comparison and analysis were performed combined with the data observed from the Daxigou Glacier Automatic Meteorological Station (AMS) over the Eastern Tianshan Mountain Station (Daxigou Station, ETMS, 43°06′N, 86°50′E, altitude 3544 m)."

(2) The RH in the two regions showed comparatively high values ranging from 40% to 70% indicate the abundant amount of atmospheric water vapor content near the ground in the Tianshan Mountain area. (3) The predominant WD both in the WTMS and ETMS near the ground was along the south-east direction, with the values of WS between 0 and 2 m/s were accounted the largest proportion in two stations. (4) The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data can reflect the changes in the synoptic weather scale of AT, RH, and AP to some extent. (5) The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data of AT and RH were underestimated by 7.2% and 45.2% in the WTMS, respectively. Whereas, the values of AP, WD, and WS were overestimated by 83.8%, 28.8%, and 74.3%, respectively over the WTMS."
