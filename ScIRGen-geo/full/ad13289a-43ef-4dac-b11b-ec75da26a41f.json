                    "Answer": "EPMA (Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer) data collection refers to the process of preparing and analyzing selected rock samples using an electron probe micro-analyzer to determine the composition and characteristics of minerals like chlorite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite. This involves using specific experimental conditions such as an acceleration voltage of 15 kV, a beam current of 15 nA, and a beam diameter of 5 μm, along with a ZAF correction method for accurate analysis. Standard samples like apatite, rutile, jadeite, almandine, rhodonite, olivine, diopside, and orthoclase are used for calibration during the analysis.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of mineral standards like apatite, rutile, and olivine in EPMA data collection methods suggests an emphasis on achieving high precision and reliability in mineral composition analysis. These standards provide reference points for various elements such as phosphorus, titanium, aluminum, sodium, iron, magnesium, and potassium, which are crucial for accurate calibration and correction of elemental measurements (using the ZAF correction method). The choice of these standards indicates a methodological rigor aimed at reducing errors and enhancing the quality of data on mineral compositions, particularly for chlorite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, and pyrrhotite in the context of the Guangdong Hetai gold mine.",
