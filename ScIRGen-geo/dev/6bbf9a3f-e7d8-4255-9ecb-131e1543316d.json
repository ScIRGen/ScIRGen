            "description": "The datasets of “Land Cover Map of Heihe River Basin” provide monthly land cover classification data in 2012-2013. The HJ-1/CCD data with both high spatial resolution (30 m) and high temporal (2 days) frequency was used to construct the time series data. The NDVI curves from the time series HJ-1/CCD data can depict the variation of typical land surface. Different land use type has different NDVI curve. Rules were set to extract every land use type information. The datasets of “Land Cover Map of Heihe River Basin” hold the traditional land use types including water bodies, urban and built-up, croplands, evergreen coniferous forests, deciduous broadleaf forests and so on. Crop type classification (including maize, spring wheat, highland barely, rape and so on), snow and ice and glaciers information updates, make the datasets more detailed. Compared with previous land cover map and other products, the classification result of the datasets is visually bette. Especially in middle stream, the accuracy of crop classification is quite high compared with the data from the ground campaign. The accuracy of land cover map of the datasets in 2012 was evaluated using very high spatial resolution remote sensing data within Google Earth and data from campaign, and the overall accuracy can be as high as 92.19%. In a word, the datasets of “Land Cover Map of Heihe River Basin” is not only high in overall accuracy, but also more detailed in crop fine classification. Furthermore, it updated some new classes like glaciers and snow. The datasets of “Land Cover Map of Heihe River Basin” are consequently the classification datasets with the highest accuracy and most detailed information up to now.",

                "Land use refers to the description of human activities related to land, and it is a key factor in understanding the impact of human activities on regional and even global changes (Running, 2008). Its distribution and changes directly reflect human economic, social, and cultural activities. Land use data is a critical influencing factor in global change research and a key parameter for land surface process models, playing a crucial role in the improvement and development of ecological, hydrological, and atmospheric models (Foley et al., 2005; Jung et al., 2006). Currently, land use data has been widely applied in research areas such as biodiversity, carbon cycling, public health, crop yield estimation, urbanization processes, and forest resource monitoring (Shen Shuanghe et al., 2009; Zheng Sheng et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2013; Hall et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2010; Poulter et al., 2011). For a long time, with the development of remote sensing monitoring technology, in-depth research has been conducted on regional and even global land use and cover and their changes, resulting in numerous remote sensing classification and mapping methods for land use and cover (Yan Jianzong et al., 2005; Zhang Zengxiang et al., 2009). In recent years, domestic scholars have attempted classification methods using neural networks, tolerance rough sets, and biologically inspired optimization methods (Hasbagan et al., 2003, 2004; Liu Xiaoping et al., 2007). Currently, land cover classification methods using visible and near-infrared remote sensing images can be roughly divided into three categories based on the data used: methods based on single-phase high spatial resolution remote sensing data, methods based on time series of medium to low spatial resolution remote sensing data, and methods combining medium to high spatial resolution and medium to low resolution remote sensing data."

It utilizes the high spatial and temporal resolution characteristics of the China Environment and Disaster Monitoring and Forecasting Small Satellite Constellation (HJ constellation) CCD data to develop a land cover classification method based on high spatial resolution time series data. This method leverages both the texture and spectral information from high spatial resolution data and the dynamic change information captured by high temporal resolution data, thereby improving the accuracy of land use mapping by utilizing the temporal differences of surface features."

Compared to traditional classification methods, this approach can effectively improve classification accuracy and the reliability of classification results while reducing costs associated with data acquisition and field surveys. However, this method also has the following issues: it requires more data than traditional methods (this study used 12 images over one year, and the data volume can be increased depending on the target); the geometric positioning and radiometric performance of HJ-1/CCD data are not the best at this stage, necessitating extensive data preprocessing to ensure image quality; and it is difficult to automate, requiring significant manual assistance."

Data preprocessing mainly includes geometric correction, radiometric calibration, and atmospheric correction. This method uses the NDVI time series as input for the SVM classifier. This study employs the SVM classifier for classification, which requires sufficient training samples. After completing the SVM classification using NDVI, indices such as NDBI and NDWI are also introduced to distinguish between water, buildings, and vegetation. In the SVM classification, due to the small differences in NDVI time series changes between built-up land and tidal flats, most tidal flats are classified as built-up land; in the post-classification processing, the built-up land layer is extracted separately, and then, utilizing the high spatial resolution (30 m) of HJ-1/CCD data, texture information is used to differentiate between the two, improving the distinction between built-up land and tidal flats, resulting in the final outcome."

HJ-1A is equipped with two CCD cameras (referred to as HJ-1A/CCD1 and HJ-1A/CCD2) and one hyperspectral imager; HJ-1B is equipped with two CCD cameras (referred to as HJ-1B/CCD1 and HJ-1B/CCD2) and one infrared camera. Satellites 1A and 1B together carry a total of four CCD cameras with similar characteristics (collectively referred to as HJ-1/CCD), each CCD camera has four bands: red, green, blue, and near-infrared, with a swath width of 360 km and a spatial resolution of 30 m. The two CCD cameras on each satellite together form a sweeping imaging capability with a swath width of 700 km; thus, the two satellites together create an HJ-1/CCD data revisit cycle of 2 days, making it the shortest revisit cycle among high-resolution remote sensing data, comparable to mid-low resolution data such as MODIS. The atmospherically corrected HJ-1/CCD data will be processed according to the NDVI calculation formula to obtain NDVI images for each of the 12 months of the year."

From the two classification examples of Liaoning Dahuo Fang Reservoir and Qinghai Heiquan Reservoir, which are quite different, it can be seen that the classification method using time series HJ-1/CCD data has three advantages: the classification accuracy of water bodies, built-up land, forest land, and arable land has been improved; small water bodies and built-up land can be better identified using the time series HJ-1/CCD data method; and the identification accuracy of linear objects has also been effectively improved. Compared to traditional methods, the method based on time series HJ-1/CCD data has an improvement of about 10% in classification accuracy, and the kappa coefficient has increased by about 0.1."

Remote sensing has become widely used as a macro-observing system for land-cover mapping, which can substitute for plant functional type (PFT) as the baseline. Several moderate to fine resolution global land-cover datasets, which are presented in detail in Table I, based on different satellite sensors are available from different research groups. These land-cover datasets listed in Table I have large variability for three reasons: 1) the data quality and properties are different; 2) there is no standard approach for classifying continuous vegetation cover into discrete categories; and 3) they are not consistent with the Earth System Model’s (ESM) requirements, because the concept of PFT, whose traits represent a combination of spectral relationships, and climatic, ecological, and theoretical assumptions, used in ESMs cannot be mapped directly using remote-sensing land-cover datasets. In addition, the classification accuracies of land-cover datasets vary and are hardly suited for land-process modeling and applications at a river basin scale. The highest uncertainty in land-cover classification from optical remotely sensed imagery occurs most frequently between the cropland and grassland categories and in dryland systems among the shrub, grassland, and forest categories because of differences in the minimum threshold required for forest cover. For the HRB, most are distributed over an arid region, so the vegetation classification in the HRB based on current land-cover datasets would cause very large uncertainty and may cause great error or even the failure of eco-hydrological and land-process modeling."
