            "description": "The samples are well qiangke-1, well qiangdi-17 and well qiangzi-16. The analysis and testing work was completed in the laboratory of AR, u-th-he geochronology, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. See Wu Lin et al. (2016) for testing methods. The results are as follows: the zircon (U-Th) / He ages of 9 samples from three boreholes in the Qiangtang block in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, except that the thermal history information of two samples from Eocene has not been reset, the rest of the samples are concentrated in Cretaceous, and the age values change little with elevation, indicating the existence of Cretaceous denudation cooling. Well qd-17 in the west of the Qiangtang block recorded denudation cooling in the early Cretaceous (about 127-114 MA), and well qz-16 in the East recorded denudation cooling in the late Cretaceous (about 92-64 MA). The denudation and cooling of the Cretaceous resulted in the statistics of regional low temperature thermochronology and the response of tectonic sedimentary events. The low-temperature thermochronological data of the Qiangtang block, Lhasa block and Himalayan block show that the Cretaceous early Eocene low-temperature thermochronological ages are widely distributed in the Northern Lhasa block and Qiangtang block (within the plateau), while the late Miocene low-temperature thermochronological ages are widely distributed in the southern Lhasa block to Himalayan block (southern margin of the plateau), This age distribution pattern suggests that the interior and southern margin of the plateau experienced different erosion cooling histories. Referring to the rapid denudation cooling process in the southern margin of the plateau since late Miocene, it is speculated that there was a Cretaceous rapid denudation cooling event in the interior of the plateau. Early Cretaceous depositional discontinuities and unconformities occurred widely in the Northern Lhasa block, Qiangtang block and its northern area, which also indicated rapid denudation during Cretaceous. Combined with the analysis of regional tectonic evolution, the Cretaceous denudation cooling may be the result of the collision between the Lhasa block and Qiangtang block after the closure of the Bangong Lake Nujiang ocean in Early Cretaceous, which indicates that there may have been obvious shortening, thickening deformation and corresponding denudation cooling in the crust of the plateau before the Cenozoic India Eurasia collision.",

                    "Answer": "The age distribution of zircon (U—Th)/He data in the Qiangtang terrane indicates significant erosion-cooling events during the Cretaceous period. Most of the samples show ages concentrated in the Cretaceous, suggesting a period of erosion and cooling. The western part of the Qiangtang terrane recorded early Cretaceous erosion-cooling (approximately 127-114 Ma), while the eastern part recorded late Cretaceous erosion-cooling (approximately 92-64 Ma). The regional low-temperature thermochronological data suggest a widespread Cretaceous to early Eocene age distribution in the northern Lhasa terrane and the Qiangtang terrane, whereas younger ages, from the late Miocene onwards, are predominant from the southern Lhasa terrane to the Himalayan terrane. This age pattern implies different erosion-cooling histories between the internal plateau and its southern margin, possibly related to significant crustal shortening, thickening, deformation, and associated erosion-cooling before the India-Eurasia collision in the Cenozoic.",

                    "Answer": "The variation in zircon (U—Th)/He ages across different elevations in the Qiangtang block is caused by the Cretaceous erosion-cooling events. These ages indicate minimal variation with elevation, suggesting a consistent erosion-cooling trend during the Cretaceous. This trend can inform data collection methods by highlighting the importance of sampling across different elevations to capture the temporal and spatial patterns of erosion and cooling. The observed ages can guide methodologies for selecting sample locations and interpreting the geological history of the region.",

It also helps in correlating these patterns with regional tectonic and sedimentary processes, allowing researchers to infer past environmental and climatic conditions and providing a basis for predicting future geological changes in similar regions.",

This data provides insights into the erosion-cooling patterns, indicating widespread Cretaceous—Early Eocene low-temperature thermochronological ages in the Qiangtang terrane and the northern Lhasa terrane, compared to the widespread ages since the Late Miocene in the southern Lhasa terrane to the Himalayan terrane. This pattern suggests distinct erosion-cooling histories between the interior and southern edge of the plateau, and supports the hypothesis of significant crustal shortening, thickening deformation, and corresponding erosion-cooling within the plateau interior prior to the Cenozoic India-Eurasia collision.",
