            "description": "This dataset contains the monthly/yearly surface shortwave band albedo, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), vegetation continuous fields (tree cover and non-tree vegetation cover, VCF), land surface temperature (LST), net radiation (RN), evapotranspiration (ET), aboveground autotrophic respiration (RA-ag), belowground autotrophic respiration (RA-bg), gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) in China from 2001 to 2018. The spatial resolution are 0.1 degree. Moreover, the dataset also includes these 11 ecosystem variables under climate-driven scenario (i.e., under no human disturbance). So, it can show the relative influences of climate change and human activities on land ecosystem in China during the 21st century.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of quantifying carbon sequestration in vegetation, 'leaf area index' refers to a dimensionless value that represents the total one-sided leaf area per unit ground surface area. It is an important parameter for understanding the density of vegetation and is used to model various ecological processes, including photosynthesis and transpiration, which are crucial for determining carbon uptake and overall productivity of terrestrial ecosystems.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial and temporal variations in ecosystem parameters, such as surface shortwave albedo, vegetation photosynthetically active radiation absorption ratio, leaf area index, forest cover, non-forest vegetation cover, surface temperature, surface net radiation, surface evapotranspiration, aboveground autotrophic respiration, belowground autotrophic respiration, total primary productivity, and net primary productivity, reflect the natural responses of China's terrestrial ecosystems to climate change over the period from 2001 to 2018. These variations can help infer the resilience and adaptability of ecosystems to climate change, as well as the potential impacts on carbon sequestration capabilities.",

                    "Answer": "Combining both climate-driven and human activity data can provide a comprehensive understanding of how these factors collectively influence changes in ecosystem parameters such as surface albedo, leaf area index, forest and non-forest vegetation cover, surface temperature, and net primary productivity. This approach allows for the differentiation between changes solely due to climate variability and those additionally impacted by human activities, providing insights into the relative contributions of each factor to carbon sequestration changes over time.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives behind collecting data on surface albedo, leaf area index, and net primary productivity are to assess the impact of climate change and human activities on the carbon sequestration capacity of China's terrestrial ecosystems. By analyzing these parameters, researchers aim to understand the temporal and spatial variations in ecosystem productivity and the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors to these changes over the period from 2001 to 2018. The data provides insights into how climate drivers and human interventions influence surface processes and ecosystem functions, aiding in the development of strategies for carbon management and environmental conservation.",
