            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace element data, zircon trace and U-Pb dating data, zircon Lu Hf isotopic data and whole rock Pb isotopic data of adakitic rocks of Shaxi Cu Au deposit in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River metallogenic belt. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can study the genesis of Shaxi copper gold related adakitic rocks and the differences between Shaxi copper gold related adakitic rocks and other adakitic rocks in Eastern Hubei, JIURUI and Tongling.",
