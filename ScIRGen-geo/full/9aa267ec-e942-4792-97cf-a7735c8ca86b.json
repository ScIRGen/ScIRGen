            "description": "China's daily snow depth simulation and prediction data set is the estimated daily snow depth data of China in the future based on the nex-gdpp model data set. The artificial neural network model of snow depth simulation takes the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation data and snow depth data of the day as the input layer of the model, The snow depth data of the next day is used as the target layer of the model to build the model, and then the snow depth simulation model is trained and verified by using the data of the national meteorological station. The model verification results show that the iterative space-time simulation ability of the model is good; The spatial correlations of the simulated and verified values of cumulative snow cover duration and cumulative snow depth are 0.97 and 0.87, and the temporal and spatial correlations of cumulative snow depth are 0.92 and 0.91, respectively. Based on the optimal model, this model is used to iteratively simulate the daily snow depth data in China in the future. The data set can provide data support for future snow disaster risk assessment, snow cover change research and climate change research in China. The basic information of the data is as follows: historical reference period (1986-2005) and future (2016-2065), as well as rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenarios and 20 climate models. Its spatial resolution is 0.25 ° * 0.25 °. The projection mode of the data is ease GR, and the data storage format is NC format.\nThe following is the data file information in NC\nTime: duration (unit: day)\nLon = 320 matrix, 320 columns in total\nLat = 160 matrix, 160 rows in total\nX Dimension: Xmin = 60.125; // Coordinates of the corner points of the lower left corner grid in the X direction of the matrix\nY Dimension: Ymin = 15.125; // Coordinates of the corner points of the grid at the lower left corner of the Y-axis of the matrix",
            "instructions": "The future daily snow depth data is stored in NC. The file name is \"rcp45access1-0.nc\", in which rcp45 represents the climate situation and access1-0.nc represents the climate model. The data includes the snow cover in China every day from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2065. The opening method is to open, browse and edit with metalinf or panoply software. The data is large. It is recommended to use MATLAB and python programming to open it.",

                "Snow cover is an important component of the cryosphere and indicator of climate change as its properties change rapidly in response to changes in heat and water on the earth’s surface. Snowfall also has an important impact on socioeconomic factors of humanity; for example, insufficient snowfall in spring can lead to drought, and excessive snowfall can create disasters, such as snow-melt floods, and major property losses. At present, the primary methods of acquiring snow parameter data include on-site observations of meteorological stations; optical remote sensing methods for identifying the extent of snow cover, based on the high reflectivity of snow in the visible band, and low reflectivity in the NIR band to define a normalized difference snow index (NDSI); passive microwave remote sensing for global/regional snow depth and snow water equivalent observations; and fusion of optical and microwave remote sensing inversions. Thus, snow depth data acquisition mainly depends on two approaches: remote sensing observations and onsite observations. Under changing global climate conditions, snow cover can serve as an important indicator. Accordingly, scientists have carried numerous studies examining the change in snow cover over historical periods, the relationship between snow cover change and climate, and the impact of snow cover change on human productivity. Some analyses have also studied future changes in snow cover based on the experimental data of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) organized by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP); however, there are few studies on the future daily snow depth, as snow accumulation and melting is a complex process affected by many factors, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, solar radiation, underlying surface type, and altitude."

A total of 155 sites were used to train the BP neural network, comprising 1,133,050 training and test samples. The input layer included data of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, daily precipitation, and daily snow depth from the National Climate Reference Stations to predict the next day snow depth data at the National Climate Reference Station. Based on the simulation model building and training, to determine the precision of the model iteration simulation, we used daily precipitation, daily minimum temperature, and daily maximum temperature data at 30 randomly selected National Climate Reference Stations. The simulated snow depths were used for comparison with the observations from the corresponding stations. Based on the spatiotemporal accuracy evaluation of the iterative simulation, the NEX-GDDP data were selected as the input values for the BPNNSIM to iteratively simulate the daily snow depth data from the corresponding model in NEX-GDDP."
