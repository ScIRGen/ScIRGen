            "description": "The dataset of automatic meteorological observations was obtained at the Dayekou Maliantan grassland station (E100°18′/N38°33′, 2817m) from Nov. 2, 2007 to  Dec. 31, 2009. The experimental area with a flat and open terrain was slightly sloping from southeast to northwest. The landscape was mainly grassland, with vegetation 0.2-0.5m high.\n     Observation items were multilayer gradient (2m and 10m) of the wind speed, the air temperature and air humidity, the air pressure, precipitation, four components of radiation, the multilayer soil temperature (5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, and 120cm), soil moisture (5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, and 120cm), and soil heat flux (5cm & 15cm). \n     The raw data were level0 and the data after basic processes were level1, in which ambiguous ones were marked; the data after strict quality control were defined as Level2. The data files were named as follows: station+datalevel+AMS+datadate. Level2 or above were strongly recommended to domestic users. As for detailed information, please refer to Meteorological and Hydrological Flux Data Guide.",

Coupling or use of the General Circulation Model (GCM) output to drive the land surface model is an important source of forcing data for large-scale land surface models, however the spatial and temporal resolution can not meet the requirements of a regional scale land surface model and its coarse resolution ignored regional environmental impact assessment. Thus, a regional scale land surface model or land surface data assimilation system needs forcing data with a higher temporal-spatial resolution. Therefore, downscaling GCM output is necessary in order to prepare for a long series of high spatial and temporal resolution forcing data for regional scale or basin-scale land surface, hydrological and ecological simulation and assimilation. Downscaling is a method of obtaining high-resolution climate or climate change information from relatively coarse-resolution GCMs. Dynamic downscaling uses large scale climatic background information to establish higher resolution meteorological distribution fields by GCMs. Regional climate model is considered to be an effective dynamic downscaling method to derive high-resolution local climate information. The model’s physical meaning is clear, it is built on the nonlinear interaction between large scale and regional scale, and can distinguish local features characterized by local topography, vegetation cover and soil hydrological processes, and can be used anywhere independent of observation data with an improved description of local features."

The average MBE of hourly 2-m surface temperature, surface pressure, 2-m relative humidity, 10-m wind speed, downward shortwave radiation and downward longwave were −0.16 °C, −6.62 hPa, −5.14%, 0.26 m/s, 33.0 W/m2 and −6.44 W/m2, the average RMSE of them were 2.62 °C, 17.10 hPa, 20.71%, 2.46 m/s, 152.9 W/m2 and 53.5 W/m2, and the average R of them were 0.96, 0.97, 0.70, 0.26, 0.91 and 0.60, respectively. Thus, the following conclusions were obtained: (1) regardless of daily or hourly validation, WRF model simulations of 2-m surface temperature, surface pressure and relative humidity are more reliable, especially for 2-m surface air temperature and surface pressure, the values of MBE were small and R were more than 0.96; (2) the WRF simulating downward shortwave radiation was relatively good, the average R between WRF simulation and hourly observation data was above 0.9, and the average R of downward longwave radiation was 0.6; (3) both wind speed and rainfall simulated from WRF model did not agree well with observation data."
