            "description": "The site No. 1 EC towers were used for the intercomparison field in the Yingke irrigation district (1552.75 m, 38°59′51.71″ N, 100°24′38.76″ E). The land surface is homogeneous and dominated by vegetables in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The precipitation comparison dataset was collected between 12 June, 2012, and 22 November, 2012. The dataset includes data for five different rain gauge types, i.e., pit gauge, Chinese standard manual precipitation gauge, siphon rain gauge, tipping bucket gauge, and weighting gauge. The mountain heights for these gauges were 0.0, 0.7, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.5 m, respectively. The data were recorded every 1 hour, 1 day, 10 minutes, 10 minutes, and 10 minutes, respectively. The main objective of the data collection was to perform an intercomparison of in situ rainfall measurements. The data processing and quality control steps were as follows: 1) The water level data which collected from the hydrological station were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. 2) Data out the normal range records were rejected. 3) Unphysical data were rejected.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
