            "description": "The dataset of airborne L-band microwave radiometer and thermal imager mission was obtained in the Binggou-A'rou flight zone in the afternoon of Apr. 1, 2008.\n     The frequency of L bands was 1.4 GHz with back sight of 35 degree and dual polarization (H&V) was acquired. The plane took off at Zhangye airport at 12:48 (BJT) and landed at 16:35 along the scheduled lines at the altitude about 5000m and speed about 260km/hr.. \n     The raw data include microwave radiometer (L) data, thermal imager data (7.5-13 um; FOV: 24×18º) and GPS data; the first were instantaneous non-imaging observation recorded in text, which could be converted into brightness temperatures according to the caliberation coefficients (filed with raw data together), and the third are aircraft longitude, latitude and attitude. Moreover, based on the respective real-time clock log, observations by the microwave radiometer and GPS can be integrated to offer coordinates matching for the former. Yaw, flip, and pitch motions of aircraft were ignored due to the low resolution of microwave radiometer observations. Observation information can also be rasterized, as required, after calibration and coordinates matching. L band resolution (x) and footprint can be approximately estimated as x=0.3H (H is relative flight height). The thermal imager was 320*240 pixels and with FOV of 24×18º. The thermal imager data were stored in binary format with a text header file. The recorded value was brightness temperature at sensor with scale and gain parameter recorded in the header file. And the thermal images were not geometrically corrected because there were gaps between sequential images.",

This requires precise calibration coefficients, hinting at potential variability in sensor readings or environmental factors that affect measurements. The requirement for geometric correction of infrared data indicates issues with spatial accuracy and alignment, potentially due to sensor movement or distortion effects during data capture. These challenges suggest that careful processing and correction are necessary to produce reliable and usable data products.",

The calibration coefficients are archived with the original observational data. This conversion process involves matching the microwave observation with GPS records using their respective timestamp records to provide geographic coordinates. The data processing typically ignores the effects of yaw, roll, and pitch of the aircraft due to the coarse resolution of the microwave radiometer observations. After calibration and coordinate matching, the observation data can be rasterized, with the resolution considered consistent with the observation footprint. For L-band, the reference resolution is calculated as 0.3 times the relative flight altitude (H). After these processing steps, the data is transformed into a product that users can directly utilize.",
