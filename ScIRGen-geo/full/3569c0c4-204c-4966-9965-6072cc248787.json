            "description": "The No. 3 hydrological section is located at Railway Heihe River Bridge (39°02′33.08″ N, 100° 25′49.42″ E, 1443 m a.s.l.) in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, Zhangye, Gansu Province. The dataset contains observations from the No.3 hydrological section from 14 June, 2012, to 24 November, 2012. The width of this section is 50 meters. The water level was measured using SR50 ultrasonic range and the discharge was measured using cross-section reconnaissance by the StreamPro ADCP. The dataset includes the following sections: Water level (recorded every 30 minutes) and Discharge. The data processing and quality control steps were as follows: 1) The water level data which collected from the hydrological station were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. 2) Data out the normal range records were rejected. 3) Unphysical data were rejected.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2016) (for multi-scale observation experiment or sites information), He et al. (2016) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

In river flow data collection, challenges are more focused on the precision of measurements and handling missing data, as evidenced by the use of SR50 ultrasonic sensors and ADCP technology, with missing data represented by a specific string.",

River flow datasets also require careful processing, particularly in terms of deriving accurate flow rate curves from water level data, but they specifically note the use of a designated value for missing data, indicating a structured approach to handle gaps in data collection.",
