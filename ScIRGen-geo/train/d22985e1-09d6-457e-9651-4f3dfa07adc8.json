            "description": "This dataset originates from the paper: Jiang, K., Xing, R., Luo, Z., Li, J., Men, Y., Shen, H., Shen, G., & Tao, S. (2023). Trends in air pollutants emissions in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas under different socioeconomic scenarios. Science of The Total Environment, 899, 165745. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165745. The dataset includes future air pollutant emission data for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), including Qinghai and Tibet, and its surrounding six countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar) under various socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs). The pollutants comprise black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The existing SSPs scenario simulations have certain deviations for the QTP and its neighboring regions, so this dataset has been constructed based on more accurate emission inventories and the SSPs scenario framework, providing more precise future emission data. The emission data are categorized into six sectors and have higher spatial resolution (0.1°×0.1°) compared to the existing SSPs dataset. This data can better serve the simulation of atmospheric pollutant environmental, health, and climate impacts in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.",
            "instructions": "File Naming: Emission data is stored in netCDF (.nc) format, with each folder's name representing a specific pollutant. Files within the folder are named as \"PollutantName_SSPScenario\" (e.g., \"BC_SSP119\"), indicating the future emission predictions for that pollutant (BC) under that SSP scenario (SSP1-1.9).\nData Reading Approach: You can use common software such as MATLAB, Python, etc., to read the nc files. Each file contains four coordinates: sector, year, latitude (lat), and longitude (lon). Emission data is expressed in units of grams per square kilometer per year (g/km²/year). More detailed information can be found in the attributes of the nc file.",
