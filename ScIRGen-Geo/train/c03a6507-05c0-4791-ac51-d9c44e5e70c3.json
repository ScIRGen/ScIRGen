After the mosaic processing, the Nodata (null data) generated in the mosaic process were interpolated and filled, and after filling, a projection conversion process was performed to generate an equal-area conical projection of the data bit Albers, after conversion projection, the spatial resolution was 90 m. Finally, the boundary of the Tibetan Plateau was used for cutting to obtain DEM data. Use the spatial analysis module under ArcMap to calculate the slope aspect and generate the slope aspect map. \nPixel data: value\nData type: floating point\nInterpretation: slope degree\nDimension: degree\nData accuracy: spatial resolution 90 m",

The project was a joint endeavor of NASA, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the German and Italian Space Agencies and flew in February 2000. At the foundation of modern geosciences, quite literally, is knowledge of the shape of the Earth’s surface. Conventional topographic mapping technologies have produced maps of uneven quality: some with astounding accuracy, some far less adequate. It has proven exceedingly difficult and expensive to produce a global map set or digital elevation model of consistent scale and resolution by conventional means. The emergence, in the 1990s, of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry placed the possibility of efficiently and affordably creating a global digital elevation model within the grasp of spacefaring nations. Interferometric SAR, or InSAR, makes use of phase-difference measurements derived from two radar images acquired with a very small base to height ratio (typically 0.0002) to measure topography."

                "The SRTM objective was to acquire a digital elevation model of all land between about 60° north latitude and 56° south latitude, about 80% of Earth’s land surface. The operational goal of C radar was to generate contiguous mapping coverage as called for by the mission objectives. X radar was included as an experimental demonstration. As it did not employ ScanSAR, the X band radar had a slightly higher resolution and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than the C band system. The key to successful acquisition of a data set suitable for automated production is to remove the variability and decorrelation due to pass-to-pass observations and to measure the interferometer baseline and other systematic effects accurately at all times during data acquisition."
