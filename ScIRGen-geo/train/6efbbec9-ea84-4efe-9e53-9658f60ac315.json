            "description": "The data are the whole rock chemical data of magmatic rocks, the major and trace mineral data of their xenoliths, and the estimated mineral temperature and pressure data. The samples are Mesozoic basalts and xenoexfoliated peridotite xenoliths in Liaoyuan area, Jilin Province. The major and trace element data of basalt were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major elements of minerals are analyzed by EPMA and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, including olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, spinel, feldspar, apatite and vitrinite. Mineral trace elements are obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis of clinopyroxene, apatite, feldspar and vitreous. The temperature and pressure data of minerals are calculated by using the composition of clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene. The obtained data can reveal the nature and metasomatic process of mantle peridotite, indicating the important role of deep faults across the lithosphere in metasomatic melt migration.",
