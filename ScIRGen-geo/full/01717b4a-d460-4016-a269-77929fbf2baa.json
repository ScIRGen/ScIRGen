Camera photography provides high-resolution original images, which are useful for visual analysis and comparison. CT scanning, on the other hand, allows for 3D reconstruction models, offering a more comprehensive view of the internal and external structures of the fossils. Together, these methods complement each other by providing both surface detail and internal anatomical insights, facilitating a more thorough analysis and comparison of fossil specimens.",
