                "Over the past decades, warming climate has resulted in the degradation of frozen soil manifested primarily by increasing ground temperature, decreasing seasonally frozen soil depth, increasing depth of active layer thickness, thinning permafrost layer, increasing fragmentation of permafrost soil, and disappearing of permafrost islands. Frozen soil degradation has exerted significant influences in ecosystem, climate, hydrology, sediment transport and infrastructure in the polar regions, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and other cold regions. About 99% of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is covered by frozen soils and degradation of frozen soils will certainly impact TP's ecosystems. Frozen soil usually underlies alpine ecosystem. Frozen soil degradation due to global warming affects alpine ecosystem. The degradation of frozen soil has affected alpine meadow and alpine steppe on the plateau. However, exactly how the degradation has affected alpine grassland is still a highly debated topic."

The model was warmed up by running iteratively from 1957 to 1986 for 1,000 yr in order to achieve dynamic vegetation equilibrium following Cuo et al. (2016) and Sitch et al.

(2013) before being aggregated to monthly values. Two permafrost soil maps compiled by Ran and Li (2000) and Zou et al.

In total, observations from 125 boreholes and 199 soil pits during 2009–2014 on the plateau were used by Zou et al. (2017). In this study, we used the map by Ran and Li (2000) at 0.0083° spatial resolution and referred to it as RL1982 to represent the early 1980s’ conditions (Nan et al., 2002, also used measurements that were originally published in 1982)."

Seasonally frozen soil also degraded by 15,636 km2 in the southeast TP, with mean annual NPP staying around 620.0 gCm−2 and annual NPP showing a significant increase at 11.00 gCm−2/year. In the future, frozen soil continues to degrade and the degradation accelerates toward the end of the century such that only 2.7% of permafrost soil in 2014 is left by 2080–2100 under the shared socioeconomic pathway SSP5-8.5. Mean annual NPP in the permafrost soil degraded zones in 2015–2100 is about half of that for 1982–2014, with spatially mixed decrease and increase trends in the near-, mid-, and long-term periods. Over the seasonally frozen soil degraded zones and the entire TP, more positive than negative annual NPP changes are seen in 2015–2100, especially in the southeast of the TP, due to improved growing conditions and the expansion of primarily subtropical and temperate scrubland. The study finds that as permafrost soil degrades, alpine meadow and steppe NPP decreases significantly in 1982–2014. In the future, permafrost soil continues to degrade in line with increasing CO2 emission. However, NPP associated with the permafrost soil degradation shows little change in the future. On the other hand, although seasonally frozen soil degrades in both the historical and future periods, the associated NPP mostly increases in both periods across the plateau."

                "Frozen soil properties and thermohydraulic processes are still not fully understood due to lack of in-situ measurements, especially in the high altitudes and high latitudes (HAHL). Sand and silt are the dominant soil particles and clay is less than 10% at the sites. Existing and widely used soil products underestimates (significantly overestimates) sand (clay) content on the TP which raises the uncertainty in the thermohydraulic parameters derived from these products. Diurnal soil moisture and temperature variations are seen only above 40 cm, but seasonal variations occur down to 120 cm due to the soil memory effect. Seasonally frozen soil and permafrost soil show different freezing and melting processes. Dry soil features greater soil temperature temporal variability and deeper maximum frozen depth than wet soil. Zero curtain occurs in both dry and wet soil, and displays high (low) frequency but short (long) duration at 10 (80) cm that vary spatially. Moisture depression exists in seasonally frozen soil and is determined by the initial soil moisture and temperature gradient strength. The strong thermohydraulic coupling existed in cold season collapses in warm season. Soil moisture exhibits higher spatiotemporal variability than soil temperature. Permafrost and seasonally frozen soils have complex thermohydraulic properties and they are widely distributed in the high altitudes and high latitudes (HAHL), accounting for about 22% and 51% of the land in the Northern Hemisphere, respectively. Since soil has up to a season-long memory of water and heat, soil heat and water conditions can be useful for sub-seasonal to seasonal climate forecasts. Soil moisture anomaly can induce feedbacks that influence precipitation processes over land in the monsoon region. High spatiotemporal-resolution in-situ measurements of soil temperature and moisture in the HAHL are the key to reveal soil thermohydraulic processes such as freezing and thawing and enhance our understanding of soil thermohydraulic theory which is critical for developing and improving the parameterization of the thermohydraulic process in numerical models. However, there are still significant challenges faced by researchers in the HAHL. One is the lack of proper understanding of physical processes. Another one is the large uncertainties in model parameterization for accurately simulating the dynamic freeze-thaw processes."

Soil samples were collected at all sites in four layers whenever possible to determine clay, silt and sand contents and soil texture using the USDA soil textural triangle diagram. The procedure was conducted in laboratory in the following steps: 1) drying soil samples in room temperature, 2) sieving soil samples through 2-mm-mesh sieves, 3) removing organic content by adding 30% H2O2 solution and carbonate by using 10% HCl solution, and 4) using the Malvern laser particle size analyzer (Mastersizer 3000) to determine the soil particle sizes."
