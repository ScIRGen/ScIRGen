            "description": "This dataset obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Huailai station from January 1 to December 31, 2021. The site (115.7923° E, 40.3574° N) was located on a cropland (maize surface) which is near Donghuayuan town of Huailai city, Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), air pressure (in the box), rain gauge (3 m, south of tower), four-component radiometer (4 m, south of tower), two infrared temperature sensors (4 m, south of tower, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (4 m, south of tower, vertically upward), soil heat flux -0.06 m), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (-0.02, -0.04 m), soil temperature profile (-0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), soil moisture profile (-0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_3 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m, Ta_20 m, Ta_30 m, and Ta_40 m; RH_3 m, RH_5 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m, RH_20 m, RH_30 m, and RH_40 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_3 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m, Ws_20 m, Ws_30 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (μmol/ (s m-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2021-6-10 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using a 40m automatic meteorological tower involves high-frequency automatic data acquisition every 30 seconds with a 10-minute output, capturing multiple layers of meteorological elements such as air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed at various heights, as well as additional elements like precipitation and radiation. This automated approach offers consistent and comprehensive data across different vertical layers and time, while ground-based manual measurements might provide less frequent data and potentially less coverage across different heights and elements.",

However, it may also introduce challenges in data management, processing, and storage, as well as require more rigorous data quality control to handle potential errors or anomalies in the large volume of data collected.",

                    "Answer": "The automatic meteorological station is installed on a 40m tower and collects data at a frequency of 30 seconds with outputs every 10 minutes. Key considerations include the installation height of sensors for air temperature and relative humidity at seven levels (3m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 30m, 40m) facing true north, wind speed at similar levels with wind direction measured at 10m facing true north, pressure sensor placed in a waterproof box, rainfall measurement at 3m, and radiation and photosynthetically active radiation at 4m facing true south. Infrared surface temperature is measured at 8m with the probe facing vertically downward. Soil temperature and moisture sensors are buried at depths ranging from 2cm to 160cm south of the tower, and soil heat flux plates are buried at 6cm depth. Data processing involves ensuring completeness with 1440 data points per day, handling missing data with a placeholder, removing duplicate records, and filtering out data that exceed physical or instrumental limits. Date and time are standardized to a single column format, e.g., 2021-6-10 10:30.",
