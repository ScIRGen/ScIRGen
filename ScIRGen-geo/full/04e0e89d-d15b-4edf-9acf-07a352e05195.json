In addition, this job attempts to quantify the undercut rate of the breach and the change rate of the downstream slope toe at each time. In order to find the relationship between them and obtain the calculation formula of the downstream slope angle, the calculation of traceability erosion was carried out. This can provide the basis for the calculation and analysis in the later stage of the project.",

The data suggest that identifying a backward erosion mode and exploring influencing factors of the erosion process can be achieved. Additionally, quantifying the breach incision rate and downstream slope toe change rate at each moment helps in understanding the relationship between these rates, potentially leading to the development of a formula for calculating the downstream slope angle. This understanding lays the foundation for future computational analysis in the project.",

Additionally, identifying key influencing factors of the upstream erosion process and establishing formulas for downstream slope angles are crucial for data quality.",

It may result in developing a model for backtracking erosion and quantifying the relationship between breach erosion rates and downstream slope changes, which could facilitate the formulation of calculation formulas for downstream slope angles. This approach could provide a foundational basis for further computational analysis in the project.",

This includes examining the influencing factors of back erosion, attempting to quantify the breach cutting rate at each moment, and the change rate of the downstream slope foot, aiming to discover the relationship between them.
