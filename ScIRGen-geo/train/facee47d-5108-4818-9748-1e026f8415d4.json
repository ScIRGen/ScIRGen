            "description": "The data are the whole rock major, trace and F element data, zircon in-situ trace element and U-Pb dating data, and apatite in-situ major and trace element geochemical data of porphyry from Yaochong Mo deposit porphyry in the Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt. The lithology of the sample is granite porphyry. The data of major and trace elements of whole rock were obtained by XRF and ICP-MS analysis, respectively, and the content of F element was obtained by F ion electrode analysis. Zircon trace element data were obtained by LA-ICP-MS, and U-Pb age data were obtained by SIMS and LA-ICP-MS. The major elements (including F, Cl) and trace elements of apatite were analyzed by EMPA and LA-ICP-MS, respectively. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals (ore geology reviews), and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can further study the genesis of porphyry Mo deposits.",

For whole-rock major and trace elements, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses are employed. For F element content, the F ion electrode analysis is utilized. Zircon trace element data is acquired using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), while U-Pb dating data is obtained through secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and LA-ICP-MS. Apatite major (including F, Cl) and trace element data are analyzed using electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) and LA-ICP-MS. These methodologies ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, which is crucial for understanding the genesis of porphyry molybdenum deposits.",
