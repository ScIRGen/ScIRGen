            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace element data, zircon U-Pb dating data, zircon trace element and Hf isotope data of Jiapigou Neoarchean granite greenstone belt in Northeast China. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the data obtained, it can be concluded that the fluid / melt formed by subduction metamorphic SCLM is an important source of Au enrichment in the early stage of Jiapigou deposit formation, and provides new evidence for gold transport and redistribution in Neoarchean greenstone belt through late hydrothermal flow.",

In geological studies, it provides crucial data that helps in understanding the chemical makeup of rocks, which is essential for interpreting geological processes and history.",

                    "Answer": "The geochemical data patterns of major and trace elements, obtained through XRF and ICP-MS analyses, suggest that the formation of Neoarchean granite-greenstone belts in Northeast China involved complex geological processes. In particular, the data supports the idea that fluids or melts derived from the subducted and metamorphosed SCLM were crucial in the early-stage enrichment of Au in the Jiapigou mineral deposit. Additionally, these patterns provide evidence for the transport and redistribution of gold through late-stage hydrothermal activity.",

                    "Answer": "The need for using multiple analytical techniques arises from the requirement to obtain comprehensive geochemical data. XRF is utilized for major element analysis, ICP-MS for trace element analysis, and LA-MC-ICP-MS for zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu-Hf isotope composition. These methods together provide a complete picture of the elemental and isotopic composition, which is crucial for understanding the formation of SCLM-derived fluids/melts and their role in Au enrichment and redistribution in greenstone belts.",
