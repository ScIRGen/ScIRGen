            "description": "On 25 July 2012, a Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner boarded on the Y-12 aircraft was used to obtain the point cloud data. Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner has unlimited numbers of returns intensities measurements including the first, second, third return intensities. The wavelength of laser light is 1064 nm. The absolute flight altitude is 5500 m with the point cloud density 1 points per square meter. Aerial LiDAR- DSM was obtained through parameter calibration, automatic classification of point cloud density and manual editing.",

                    "Answer": "An airborne Lidar remote sensing flight experiment involves using a manned aircraft, equipped with Lidar technology such as the Leica ALS70, to collect high-resolution spatial data over a specific study area. In an ecological and hydrological research context, such as in the core observation region of the middle and upper reaches of a river, the Lidar system emits laser pulses at a wavelength of 1064nm to capture multiple return signals (first, second, third, and last). The aircraft flies at an absolute altitude, for example, 5500 meters, to ensure comprehensive coverage and sufficient data density, like an average point cloud density of 1 point per square meter. This data is then processed through calibration, automatic classification, and manual editing to produce products like Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and Digital Surface Models (DSM), which are essential for analyzing the topography and surface features of the area.",

                    "Answer": "The use of airborne LiDAR systems like the ALS70, with a laser wavelength of 1064nm and multiple returns (1, 2, 3, and last), suggests that it is effective in capturing detailed topographical data due to its capability to provide multiple echo returns and high point cloud density (1 point/square meter) even at an absolute flight height of 5500 meters. This allows for the creation of detailed DEM and DSM products through processes such as parameter calibration, automatic point cloud classification, and manual editing.",
