            "description": "This data set consists of volcanic ash chronological analysis data in Serbian loess. Volcanic ash chronology is a method to correlate and date geological, PALEOCLIMATOLOGICAL, archaeological and other strata and events by using volcanic ash layer as isochronous marker. Generally, the volcanic ash in sediments is compared through the chemical composition characteristics and characteristic mineral assemblages of minerals, and the age of volcanic ash layer is determined through the calibration of isochronous strata in the region; The age of the volcanic ash layer can also be determined by absolute dating methods such as AR ar. The volcanic ash chronological analysis data include the single mineral chemical composition of 8 layers of volcanic ash samples in different loess sections of Serbia and the AR ar chronological data of diorthite of 1 layer of volcanic ash samples. Among them, the single mineral chemical composition of volcanic ash samples was determined by jeol jxa 8100 electron probe of electron probe and scanning electron microscope laboratory of Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The AR ar chronology data of diorite of volcanic ash samples were determined by helix SFT mass spectrometer of environmental research center of Scottish University Union. This data can provide further age constraints for the Loess in Serbia and is of great significance for the study of paleoclimate / Paleoenvironment in southeastern Europe.",

The single mineral chemical composition is measured using an electron probe microanalyzer, such as the JEOL JXA 8100, to identify and compare the chemical characteristics of minerals in the ash. For precise dating, the Ar-Ar method involves using a mass spectrometer, like the Helix SFT, to analyze the isotopic composition of feldspar minerals. This combination of chemical and isotopic analysis allows for the correlation of volcanic ash layers and the establishment of their ages, providing crucial temporal constraints for geological and paleoenvironmental studies.",
