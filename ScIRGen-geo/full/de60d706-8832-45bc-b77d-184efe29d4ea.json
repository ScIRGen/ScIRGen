            "description": "The data set includes major and trace elements, major mineral elements, whole rock SR – nd Hf isotope, zircon u – Pb age and O isotope data of volcanic rocks. Samples were collected from basalt and rhyolite in Yanshiping area, Qiangtang, central Tibet. Zircon U-Pb geochronology and oxygen isotope data were obtained by secondary ion probe mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data of major elements in minerals are obtained by electron microprobe. The whole rock SR – nd HF isotopes were obtained by sample separation and purification multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Through the data obtained, we can define the age, origin and deep dynamic mechanism of magmatism in the region.",
