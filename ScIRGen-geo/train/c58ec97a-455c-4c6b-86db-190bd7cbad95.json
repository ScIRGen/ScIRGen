            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Huailai station. There were two types of LASs: German BLS450 and zzLAS. The observation periods were from January 1 to December 31, 2021. The site ( (north: 115.7825° E, 40.3522° N; south: 115.7880° E, 40.3491° N) was located in the Donghuahuan town of Huailai city, Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The underlying surface between the two towers contains mainly maize. The effective height of the LASs was 14 m; the path length was 1870 m. Data were sampled at 1 min intervals.\nRaw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality-controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The main quality control steps were as follows. (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 was beyond the saturated criterion. (2) Data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small. (3) Data were rejected within 1 h of precipitation. (4) Data were rejected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). The sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining with meteorological data and based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory.\nThere were several instructions for the released data. (1) The data were primarily obtained from BLS450 measurements; missing flux measurements from the BLS450 were filled with measurements from the zzLAS. Missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: data/time (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H_LAS, W/m^2). (3) In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                "Sensible and latent heat fluxes are important indicators reflecting the intensity of heat and water vapor exchange between the land and atmosphere, influencing the energy balance between them, providing material, dynamic, and thermal sources for weather systems of different scales, and affecting the water cycle process between the land and atmosphere. Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness only on the order of tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS can better match the pixel scale of satellite imagery and the grid scale of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth at the pixel/grid scale for remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."
