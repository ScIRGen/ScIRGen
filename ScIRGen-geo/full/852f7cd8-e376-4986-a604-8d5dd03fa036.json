            "description": "The data set of light absorbing impurities in snow and ice in and around the Qinghai Tibet Plateau include black carbon and dust concentration data and their mass absorption cross sections from 9 glaciers (Urumqi glacier No.1,  Laohugou glacier No.12, xiaodongkemadi glacier, renlongba glacier, Baishui River glacier No.1, and golubin glacier, Abramov glacier, syekzapadniyi glacier and No. 354 glacier in Pamir region) . The black carbon data is obtained by DRI 2015 model thermo-optical carbon analyzer, and the dust data is obtained by weighing method. The sampling and experimental processes are carried out in strict accordance with the requirements. The data can be used for the study of snow ice albedo and climate effect.",
