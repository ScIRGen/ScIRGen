            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR and ALOS PALSAR was obtained in the Linze station foci experimental area on May 24, 2008. The data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 11:34 BJT. Observation items included:\n     (1) soil moisture (0-5cm) measured once by cutting ring method at corner points of the 40 subplots of the west-east desert transit zone strip, one time by cutting ring method in nine subplots of the north-south desert transit zone, strip and once by the cutting ring and three times by ML2X Soil Moisture Tachometer in the center points of nine subplots of Wulidun farmland quadrates . The preprocessed soil volumetric moisture data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) surface radiative temperature by measured two handheld infrared thermometer (5# and 6# from Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute which were both calibrated) in 40 subplots of the west-east desert transit zone strip (repeated 14-30 times each), and nine subplots of the north-south desert transit zone strip (repeated 12-30 times). There are 34 sample points in total and each was repeated three times synchronizing with the airplane. Photos were taken. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     (3) LAI, the plant height and the spacing measured by the ruler and the set square in Wulidun farmland quadrates and Linze station quadrates. Part of the samples were also measured by LI-3100. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",
