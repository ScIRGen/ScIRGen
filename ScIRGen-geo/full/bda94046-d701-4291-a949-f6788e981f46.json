            "description": "The data sets include four sets of data obtained from the Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) sensors using passive microwave remote sensing inversion. SMMR was aboard the Nimbus-7 satellite, and its working period was from October 26, 1978 to July 8, 1987. Since July 1987, the data provided by the SSM/I and the SSMIS aboard the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite group have been used.\n\nThe first three data sets contain sea ice concentration data, covering the Antarctic region with a spatial resolution of 25 km:\n(1) The data were obtained from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Version 1 by applying the NASA Team algorithm inversion. The temporal coverage is from November 1978 to February 2017, with a temporal resolution of one month. A bin file is stored every month.\n(2) The data source is the same as the first set. The temporal coverage is from 1978-10-26 to 2017-2-28. The temporal resolution is two days, and the spatial resolution is 25 km. A folder was stored every year, and a bin file was stored every other day.\n(3) The data were obtained from near-real-time DMSP SSMIS by applying the NASA Team algorithm inversion. The temporal coverage is from 2015-1-1 to 2018-2-3, and the temporal resolution is one day. A bin file is stored every day. Each file consists of a 300-byte file title (data time information, projection pattern, file name) and a 316*332 matrix.\n\nThe fourth set of data is the sea ice coverage and sea ice area time series. The temporal coverage is from November 1978 to December 2017. This data set is a time series sequence of sea ice coverage and sea ice area in the Antarctic. The temporal resolution is one month, and an ASCII file is stored every month. Each file consists of a file title (time, data type), a 39*1 sea ice cover matrix and a 39*1 sea ice area matrix.\nFor further details on the data, please visit the US Ice and Snow Data Center NSIDC website - Data Description http://nsidc.org/data/NSIDC-0051; http://nsidc.org/data/NSIDC-0081; http://nsidc.org/data/G02135",

                "The Arctic has experienced extensive sea ice retreat in recent decades, as observed from satellite remote sensing and simulated by general circulation models. The significant low albedo of melt pond compared with snow and ice results in more absorption of radiation compared with sea ice without melt pond, which will then enhance sea ice melt to form more melt pond. This so-called positive feedback of melt pond is crucial for sea ice thermal and physical properties. The quantification of melt pond coverage is important for the energy balance and climate change studies of the Earth. Recent studies show that the considering of melt pond in sea ice model can improve the prediction skill of sea ice models. Satellite derived melt pond cover fraction also served as calibration and validation dataset for sea ice process models. The assimilation of satellite derived melt pond cover fraction in sea ice model also has the potential to improve the sea ice modeling. These studies indicate that the melt pond related process is important in the ocean and sea ice system. The melt pond coverage varies significantly spatially and temporally, satellite remote sensing provides a possible solution in determining the spatial coverage of melt pond."

                "All the above-mentioned melt pond cover fraction estimation methods based on active or passive microwave remote sensing suffer from the fundamental shortcoming of the similar microwave scattering and emission signature of melt pond and open water. The varying sea ice microwave signature, distinct microwave scattering and emission signature of dry snow/ice and wet snow/ice, and varying water surface roughness also makes the melt pond cover fraction retrieval from active and passive microwave remote sensing challenging. The constant endmember reflectance (snow, ice, melt pond, and open water) assumption may cause deviation of estimated MPF from real values, because the reflectance of melt pond varies spatially and temporally with underlying sea ice and melt pond parameters. However, the quality of machine learning algorithms depends on the training samples. The limited training data used in training may cause region and time dependent error in estimating MPF because of the spatial and temporal variation of sea ice and melt pond reflectance. Currently the quantity of training data is not enough to develop a robust machine learning based MPF retrieval algorithm."

                "In the newly developed algorithm, dynamic sea ice and melt pond reflectances are used in the pixel spectral unmixing for melt pond fraction (MPF) estimation. Radiative transfer models for sea ice and melt pond reflectance modeling are developed for MPF retrieval algorithm. The validation of retrieved MPF and its comparison with static pixel spectral unmixing results show that the dynamic algorithm proposed in this study has the potential of application in wide range of situations by considering dynamic spectral reflectances of melt pond and sea ice. First, a melt pond reflectance model and sea ice reflectance model are developed based on Mie scattering theory and multiple layer radiative transfer theory. In the MPF estimation algorithm developed in this study, linear pixel unmixing algorithm is used such as used in many studies, but with dynamic endmember reflectance. A special index and melt pond depth are used to describe the melt pond reflectance, and then look up table (LUT) is constructed in the MPF estimation algorithm when searching for optimized spectral reflectance. Then, 22-year Pan-Arctic MPF is produced using the newly develop algorithm and the spatial – temporal characteristics of MPF in Arctic is analyzed and discussed."

The spatial resolution of the MOD09A1 product is 500 m, and the temporal resolution is 8 days. In this study, the remote sensing retrieved MPF in Arctic is validated using three independent sets of in-situ data. MEDEA (National Technical Means images): This dataset is generated based on high-resolution optical satellite images by Webster et al. (2015) and contains two independent data sets, one is obtained by Webster et al. (2015), covering the period from 1999 to 2014, and the other is obtained by using supervised classification techniques, covering the period from 1999 to 2001. WorldView(WV): WorldView-2 provides commercial panchromatic images with a resolution of 0.46 m and eight-band multispectral images with a resolution of 1.84 m. The MPF used in this study is derived using WorldView satellite images by Wright and Polashenski (2019) during 2010 – 2015, and the data covers the period from March to August of 2010 – 2015. NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center): The high-resolution satellite images in this data set were obtained from four sites (Beaufort Sea, East Siberian Sea, Canadian Arctic and Fram Strait) located in the Arctic Ocean in 1999, 2000 and 2001. NPI (Norwegian Polar Institute): This dataset is derived from images acquired by a helicopter-borne camera. The footprint size of each data record is about 40 × 60 m. The images are taken during a field campaign on Arctic sea ice in summer 2012. TransArc: In this dataset the sea ice parameters are estimated visually during the Germany trans-Polar cruise ARKXXVI/3 during August to September 2011. IceWatch: This dataset is from the IceWatch community which co-ordinates visual observation of sea ice conducted from ships. The sea ice and melt pond cover fraction are also estimated visually from the bridge of ship. Data records from 2008 to 2020 are used in this study."

Trend analysis for typical regions such as Beaufort Sea, Greenland Sea, the Baffin Bay, Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara seas and center Arctic also reveals that the relative MPF and SIF show contrasting trend."
