In 2017, in-situ Lu Hf isotopic analysis of zircons was performed at the State Key Laboratory of isotopes, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with Neptune plus MC-ICP-MS and resolutionm-50 laser ablation system as instruments. Laser parameter spot 45 μ m. The repetition rate is 8 Hz and the energy is 80 MJ. He was used as carrier gas and a small amount of nitrogen was added to improve the sample signal. Penglai zircon is used as standard sample in the test, with 176hf / 177hf of 0.2828906 ±  10 (2 σ,  Li et al., 2010b). The analysis point and U-Pb dating analysis point are at the same location or near the same zircon. See Wu et al. (2006a) for detailed analysis method.",

                "Hainan Island, an epicontinental-type island, is located on the northern margin of the South China sea and characterized by multistage continental rifting and assembly as well as episodic crustal growth likely since late Archean. The most important epochs for the Hainan crustal growth likely include Paleoproterozoic of ca. 2.0 Ga age and late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic of ca. 1.0 Ga age, which probably are linked to the evolutions of the Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent and the Mesoproterozoic to Early Neoproterozoic Rodina supercontinent, respectively. Previous reconstructions of Rodinia supercontinent usually placed Hainan Island as part of the Cathaysia Block, South China and thus, South China (including Hainan Island) was considered to be situated between western Laurentia and southeastern Australia in the Rodinia, on the basis of the presence of the Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1.43 Ga) magmatic rocks in Hainan Island. In contrast, some researchers proposed that the South China was located on the periphery of Rodinia near western Australia and India based on zircon U-Pb geochronological data from both the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks of South China.",
                "Inferences about the continental crust evolution have largely come from the study of neodymium and hafnium isotope systematics. Since the Nd isotope system cannot resolve individual periods of crustal growth and the Hf isotopic analysis technology has gained great progresses, zircon Hf isotope data have been used increasingly to constrain the growth and differentiation of the continental crust. South China comprises the Cathaysia Block in the southeast and the Yangtze Block in the northwest, which were amalgamated during the Neoproterozoic due to the assembly of Rodinia. Hainan Island, separated from South China mainland by the Qiongzhou Strait, lies at the joint of the Eurasian plate, Indian-Australian plate and Pacific plate which makes the Island especially significant for understanding the continental margin accretion and evolution of East Asia.",
                "Hafnium isotopic compositions of zircon grains were measured using a Neptune MC-ICPMS coupled with New Wave Merchantek LUV213 type laser system at the State Key Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SKLIG-GIG, CAS). The late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic Shilu Group and the early Neoproterozoic Shihuiding Formation are two important Precambrian successions in Hainan Island, and are also good source materials for investigating the Precambrian tectonic evolution of Hainan Island and even for encoding the tectonic position of the Cathaysia Block in Rodinia. The terrestrial continental crust can be defined as the unique feature which distinguishes earth from other planets in the solar system. The formation and evolution of the continental crust have always been the most important topic and debate in earth science.",
                "Reconstruction of the paleo-geographical position of the relationship between two specific continents requires integration of multiple lines of evidence including understanding of the tectonic setting, orogenic histories, high-quality geochronological, crustal evolution, paleobiogeographic data, etc. (Li et al., 2008a). With the discovery of Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks along the Wuyi-Yunkai belt, school of researchers suggested that the Cathaysia Block was an active continental margin during Neoproterozoic time (Ling et al., 2003; Shu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013b; Xia et al., 2015)."

Combined with previous reported studies, we further discussed the time of crust-mantle differentiation histories and the crustal evolution mode in Hainan Island as well as suggested the relationship between Hainan Island and the Cathaysia Block of South China before or during the assembly of Rodinia.",
                "Thus, one of the key issues is that whether or not the 1.80–1.43 Ga crystalline rocks in Hainan Island can be interpreted as part of the Proterozoic basement rocks for the Cathaysia Block of South China."

Twelve samples which were previously analyzed for geochronology only were collected from the Shilu Group and overlying Shihuiding Formation for zircon Hf analysis.",
                "In this study, five hundred and sixty-seven Hf isotopic spots were analyzed on the detrital zircons from the collected twelve samples. The Hf isotopic data was filtered sequentially using the following exclusion criteria from Belousova et al. (2010): (1) zircons with U-Pb age discordance over 10% were rejected; (2) zircons with formation age bigger than the model age were rejected; (3) zircons with Th/U <0.05 were rejected because of the potential for metamorphic origin. A total of one hundred and seventy-one zircon grains, collected from the Shihuiding Formation, were analyzed for Hf-isotope composition. A total of two hundred and seventy-two Hf-isotopic analyses on zircon grains from nine samples of the Shilu Group were obtained. In the Sixth sequence of Shilu Group, 177 Hf-isotopic analyses were conducted on zircon grains from six samples. For the Fifth sequence of Shilu Group, 19 hafnium analyses on sample sL5-D yielded variable 176Hf/177Hf ratios. Seventy-six Hf analyses on zircon grains from two samples of the Fourth sequence were implemented."

                "The continental crust of Hainan Island maybe appeared firstly at ca. 4.0–3.8 Ga and then was reworked. Unambiguously, the crustal basement rocks in Hainan Island were formed mainly through reworking the previous continental components with minor input of juvenile materials. The generation of juvenile crust in Hainan Island predominantly occurred at ca. 2.7 Ga and ca. 1.5–1.0 Ga, which are consistent with that for the assembly of the Kenorland, and the Columbia breakup and subsequent amalgamation of the Rodinia, respectively. The present study further reveals that the crustal growths in Hainan Island are present at 2.7 Ga, 2.3 Ga and 2.1–1.8 Ga, which is more favorable to the episodic growth mode. Moreover, a rough trend of decreasing maximum crustal incubation time of Hainan Island demonstrates that the incubation time of the juvenile crust is shorter when compared with that of the Cathaysia Block in the late Mesoproterozoic.",
                "These independent lines of evidence demonstrate that the Hainan Island was not adjacent to the Cathaysia Block of South China before the Neoproterozoic.",
                "The similar predominate peaks in detrital zircon age patterns and the small age gap of the maximum depositional ages suggest a continuous sedimentation for both the Shilu Group and overlying Shihuiding Formation which originated from the same depositional system. The poor relationship between the periods of supercontinent assemblies and the Hf model age peaks may support the hypothesis of episodic crustal growth. Zircons Hf isotopic constrains demonstrate that 2.7 Ga, 2.3 Ga and 2.1–1.8 Ga are the three main continental crust growth periods in Hainan Island. The late Archean of ca. 2.7 Ga age and the Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic transition of ca. 1.5–1.0 Ga age are the two important periods of juvenile crust growth in Hainan Island. Hainan Island likely did not share the same evolution history as the Cathaysia Block of South China before or during the Rodinia assembly, consistent with that both the continents do not have the same metamorphic basement."
