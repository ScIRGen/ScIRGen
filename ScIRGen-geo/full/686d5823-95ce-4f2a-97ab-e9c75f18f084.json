By selecting the epicentral distance of 30-90 degrees and the teleseismic events greater than 5.5 degrees recorded by 4 fixed stations set up by China Seismological Bureau and 10 mobile stations set up by Institute of Geology and Geophysics of Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2010 to 2012 in the study area, the time domain iterative deconvolution method is used to obtain the radial convergence function. The results show that: the thickness of sedimentary layer is mainly distributed in 4.2-7.6 km, and the wave velocity ratio is generally more than 1.87; the thickness of bedrock is mainly distributed in 33.4-41.8 km, and the wave velocity ratio is generally less than 1.74. The uploaded data provide valuable data and information for others to further study the structural characteristics of Sichuan Basin.",

Two-layer sedimentary cover was observed beneath eight stations, probably corresponding to the sediment in the Phanerozoic and Precambrian. The observed thickness and Vp/Vs ratio of the crystalline crust range from 33.4 to 41.8 km and from 1.61 to 1.78, respectively, suggesting typical cratonic crust in the Sichuan Basin.

                    "Answer": "The traditional single-layer H–k stacking method may not accurately capture the Sichuan Basin's subsurface structures because it could introduce errors or false images beneath the subsediment crust, such as the crustal thickness and S-wave velocity, due to the low-velocity sedimentary cover.",

                    "Answer": "The observed range of Vp/Vs ratios in the sedimentary cover, from 1.86 to 2.55, suggests the presence of unconsolidated sediments containing water or other fluids. The Vp/Vs ratios in the crystalline crust, ranging from 1.61 to 1.78, suggest characteristics typical of a cratonic crust in the Sichuan Basin.",

For example, a higher Vp/Vs ratio in the sedimentary cover suggests the presence of unconsolidated sediments containing water or other fluids, while a lower ratio in the crystalline crust indicates typical cratonic crust characteristics.",
