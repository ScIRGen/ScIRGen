            "description": "This data set is a national high-resolution solar radiation data set covering 34 years (1983.7-2017.6), with a resolution of 10 km. The data unit is W / m2. The data set is developed by merging  the global high-resolution (3 hours, 10 km) surface solar radiation data set (1983-2017) with isccp-hxg cloud products as the main input, with ground based sunshine duration derived surface solar raidation data from 2261 meteorological stations in China by using the geographic weighted regression method. The validation results  show that this dataset can provide more accurate simulation of long-term variability of surface solar radiation than that of gewex-srb, cmsaf-clara-a2 and the isccp-hxg based surface solar radiation  product. This data can provide favorable data support for the application and research of long-term change of hydrology in land surface process simulation.",

                "Long-term changes in surface solar radiation (Rs, spectral range of 0.3–3.0 µm) with a decrease (global dimming) from the 1950s to the late 1980s and a subsequent increase (global brightening) have been observed worldwide. Global dimming and brightening inevitably lead to energy balance changes and have substantial impacts on land surface climate, hydrologic cycle, carbon cycle and human activity. Direct observations can provide accurate Rs records. Before 1990, the USSR pyranometer imitations had different degradation rates in the thermopile, resulting in an important sensitivity drift. To overcome radiometer aging, China replaced its instruments from 1990 to 1993. However, the new solar trackers frequently failed and introduced a high missing data rate for the direct radiation component of Rs. After 1993, although the instruments were substantially improved, the Chinese-developed pyranometers still had a high thermal offset with directional response errors, and the stability of these instruments was also worse than that of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-recommended first-class pyranometers. Since the 1960s, the possibility of estimating Rs from satellites has been examined in many studies. Due to the capability of capturing the spatial distribution and dynamic evolution of clouds from satellite data, satellite-derived Rs products have long been recognized as better methods to estimate regional and global Rs than numerical modeling. The trend of Rs derived from satellites has been shown to be consistent with ground observations but differs in sign and magnitude. Satellite Rs products based on the early version of the ISCCP cloud dataset show quite different interannual variations in Rs from 1984 to 2000, which are only approximately one half to one third of the direct Rs surface observations over China. The surface sunshine duration (SunDu) is the sum of the time for which the ground surface is irradiated by a direct solar irradiance beam exceeding a certain threshold (usually 120 W/m2) and is considered to be a reliable proxy of Rs. SunDu has been used as reference data to adjust the inhomogeneity of direct observations over China. Previous studies further demonstrate that SunDu can be used as a reliable proxy for direct Rs observed data to reconstruct long-term Rs. The previously mentioned inhomogeneity adjustment methods mainly focus on Rs data over observation sites, and the adjustment processes are generally “point to point” corrections. Comparatively, inhomogeneities in the satellite Rs gridded data have attracted little attention due to the lack of reliable Rs reference data with large spatial coverage."
