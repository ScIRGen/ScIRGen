            "description": "Geladandong region is an important and typical source region of great rivers and lakes in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. This data set provides DEM covering glaciers in the source region of the Yangtze River and Selin Co with different time scales and resolutions to calculate the seasonal and decadal changes of glacier surface elevation in the source region. This data set includes seven 5-meter resolution TanDEM-X data from July 2016 to 2017, which can be used to calculate the seasonal change of glacier surface elevation; it includes one KH-9 DEM with a resolution of 30m in 1976, five TanDEM-X with a resolution of 30m in 2011, one TanDEM-X in 2014 and three TanDEM-X in 2017 with a resolution of 30m. The data can be used to calculate the change of glacier surface elevation during 1976-2000, 2000-20112011-2017. At the same time, Landsat ETM data are used to extract the glacier outline in 1976and we divide it according to the RGI6.0; The right figure shows the spatial and temporal coverage information of the data set, and the base figure is the orthophoto corrected kh-9 image.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) (mean elevation ∼4000 m a.s.l.) has the greatest abundance of glaciers outside the polar regions, with a total area of ∼10 × 104 km2 (RGI Consortium, 2017) and a total ice volume of∼7×1 03 km3 (Farinotti and others,2019). Most large Asian rivers originate in this region and so it is also known as the water towers of Asia. Over the past few decades, the climate in the TP has become wetter and warmer (Li and others,2018a), resulting in glacier mass loss (GML) (Yao and others,2012b; Brun and others, 2017; Zhou and others, 2018), lake expansion (Lei and others,2014; Zhang and others,2019a) and an increase in river runoff (Lutz and others,2014). These changes are altering the balance of the cryosphere and have significant impacts on the local hydro-climate-ecological cycle, and water supplies (Immerzeel and others,2010; Lutz and others,2014; Milner and others,2017). The Geladandong Mountains are located in the Tanggula mountain range in the central TP, an area influenced by both continental climate and the Indian summer monsoon (Tian and others,2001; Yao and others,2013). Glaciers are widely distributed throughout this region due to the low temperature and sufficient precipitation (Ding and others,1992). Due to the TP’s extreme environment, almost no glaciological field measurements have been carried out, but several studies using Landsat images have suggested an accelerated shrinkage of glaciers in this region from 1969 to 2011 (Ye and others,2006; Zhang and others, 2013b, 2013a). However, there are three main issues surrounding these studies. The first is due to the large uncertainties in the data or methods used. ICESat, with its sparse tracks, only covered a limited area of the glaciers and a limited time period (2003–2009), resulting in large discrepancies between studies (Neckel and others,2014; Chao and others,2017). Generated DEMs from optical images suffer from large gaps in accumulation areas such as Ziyuan-3 (Liu and others, 2020). Second, spatial and temporal data coverage is inconsistent, hindering comprehension of the glaciers’ long-term response to environmental change (Table 1). Finally, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal penetration differences and the neglected seasonal glacier elevation change in these studies could have large effects on the results, especially over short time periods of <10 years (Liu and others,2020)."

                "Here, we examine long-term changes in glacier mass balance over 1976–2017 using KH-9 and CoSSC-TanDEM-X data. The aim is to determine how the glaciers have changed on regional, basin and individual glacier scales in response to the changing climate. Given these differences and uncertainties in current estimates of glacier mass change, a consistent and long-term estimate of glacier mass balance from the Geladandong Mountains will help to improve our understanding of the response of glaciers to climate change and its hydrological consequences."

We investigate three periods of glacier mass change from 1976 to 2017 using the KH-9 and TanDEM-X CoSSC datasets. Cloud-free Landsat MSS images (Table 2) were used to map the glacier boundaries in 1976 in our study area by using the ISODATA-based unsupervised classification method in ENVI software. The TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite, launched in 2007, and the TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement, TDX), launched in 2010, are coupled into one satellite constellation with a slanting incline to obtain high-resolution terrain measurements of the Earth’s surface. According to previous studies (Neckel and others, 2014; Liu and others, 2019), TDX DEM was generated using the InSAR TanDEM-X bistatic DEM Workflow in ENVI. The KH-9 images (accessed from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov) have been scanned from archived films by NASA, and could be distorted (Surazakov and Aizen, 2010). A total of 1081 fiducial marks in the KH-9 image automatically recognized by the MATLAB code were utilized to correct any such distortion (Surazakov and Aizen, 2010)."
