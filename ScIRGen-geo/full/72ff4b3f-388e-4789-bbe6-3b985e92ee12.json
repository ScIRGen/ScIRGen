In 2020, a total of 775 bird survey sites will be collected in Chayu and Motuo counties of Nyingchi Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region. This data set contains a sample information table, which contains 4029 bird observation data. Each information includes species name, Latin name, sampling place, survey time, investigator, altitude, habitat type, distance from the midpoint and other basic information, which is stored in Excel. The corresponding photos and videos were collected into the data set of the animal special topic \"the second Qinghai Tibet scientific research plateau animal diversity protection and sustainable use (2019qzk0501) photo and video (2020)\".",
