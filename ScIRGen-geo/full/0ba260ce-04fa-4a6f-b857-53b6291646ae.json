(2019). The paleoclimatic footprint in the soil carbon stock of the Tibetan permafrost region. Nature Communications, 10(1), 4195. doi:10.1038/s41467-019-12214-5.\nThis data contains R code and a new estimate of Tibetan soil carbon pool to 3 m depth, at a 0.1° spatial resolution.\nPrevious assessments of the Tibetan soil carbon pools have relied on a collection of predictors based only on modern climate and remote sensing-based vegetation features. Here, researchers have merged modern climate and remote sensing-based methods common in previous estimates, with paleoclimate, landform and soil geochemical properties in multiple machine learning algorithms, to make a new estimate of the permafrost soil carbon pool to 3 m depth over the Tibetan Plateau, and find that the stock (38.9-34.2 Pg C) is triple that predicted by ecosystem models (11.5 ± 4.2 Pg C), which use pre-industrial climate to initialize the soil carbon pool. This study provides evidence that illustrates, for the first time, the bias caused by the lack of paleoclimate information in ecosystem models.\nThe data contains the following fields:\nLongitude (°E)\nLatitude (°N)\nSOCD (0-30cm) (kg C m-2)\nSOCD (0-300cm) (kg C m-2)\nGridArea (k㎡)\n3mCstcok (10^6 kg C)",

                "Tibetan permafrost largely formed during the late Pleistocene glacial period and shrank in the Holocene Thermal Maximum period. Quantifying the impacts of paleoclimatic extremes on soil carbon stock can shed light on the vulnerability of permafrost carbon in the future. There is evidence that the paleoclimate has influenced the cycling of soil carbon through shifting biomes and by altering soil physiochemical properties. Land regions of permafrost constitute the largest soil carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems, and, with an area of 1.06 million km2, the Tibetan Plateau is the largest alpine permafrost area outside the polar regions. Evidence from preserved relict permafrost and periglacial phenomena indicate that the main body of the existing Tibetan permafrost was formed during the last glaciation period, at the end of the late Pleistocene, which was characterised by cold and arid periglacial environments."

Here, we compile data from 1114 sites collected during 11 field campaigns across the Tibetan permafrost region, and use multiple statistical techniques to assess the relative importance of climates from the last glacial maximum (LGM), an extremely cold period 22,000 years ago; the mid-Holocene (MidH), a hypsithermal period about 6000 years ago; and the modern climate (1975–2015) in driving the current spatial pattern of permafrost soil carbon."

                "We have synthesized soil data collected from 1114 sites during 11 field campaigns conducted by multiple research teams over the past three decades. Soil organic carbon density (SOCD, kg C m−2) was estimated based on soil organic carbon concentration (SOCC, g kg−1), bulk density (BD, g cm−3), soil layer depth (T, cm) and rock (diameter larger than 2 mm) content (C, %) in layer i, using the following formulation. Since all sites have data for the top 30 cm soil layer, we first assessed the relative contributions of paleo- and modern climate using 30 cm SOCD. The missing values of BD (21%) were estimated using pedotransfer functions between SOCC and BD, while missing rock content values (29%) were estimated by using the mean values for the same soil type. The full data set includes 325 sites with deep soil data (extending to more than 200 cm in depth), with SOCD data for seven different layers: 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–50, 50–100, 100–200 and 200–300 cm. We compiled a climate data set composed of climate over the period 1975–2015 (modern climate), and paleoclimates in the mid-Holocene (MidH) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Principle component analysis was used for the climate variables in each period to eliminate multicollinearity. We synthesized data with multiple key soil physical (i.e., soil moisture and texture), and geochemical factors, such as CEC, K, P and pH. The spatially explicit soil property data were sourced from publicly available databases or were derived from spatial interpolation of site observations as described below. The climate (both modern and paleoclimate) and soil properties data were used to assess the relative importance of modern and paleoclimate in affecting modern soil carbon stock using a variety of statistical methods, and then subjected to the SVM model to predict the modern carbon stock over the entire study region. We used a combined approach involving multiple statistical models to analyse the relative importance of paleo- and modern climate. Specifically, random forest analysis was used to rank the relative importance of the predictors. Variation partitioning modelling was used to identify the relative importance of paleoclimate and modern climate on soil carbon stock. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to identify the direct and indirect (via soil properties) effects of paleoclimate on soil carbon stock, and to evaluate the contributions of these factors by assessing the degree of the standardized total effect (direct effect plus indirect effect). In addition, we used partial correlation analysis between the soil carbon stock and the current climate with soil variables controlled separately, and with all soil properties controlled, to identify the effect of the current climate on the soil carbon stock. We quantified the relative contributions of the regressors using the Lindeman–Merenda–Gold method. We calculated the freezing index (FI, Eqs.2–3) for LGM and MidH periods using paleoclimate simulations from the CCSM model, and analysed the relative change of the freezing index from LGM to MidH to infer the change of permafrost extent. Here, we used several different machine learning algorithms to estimate SOCD over the permafrost regions of the Tibetan Plateau. We, therefore, used SVM and a high resolution (250 m) soil depth data set to estimate the top 30 cm soil carbon stock in a spatially explicit manner over the permafrost regions of the Tibetan Plateau. An uncertainty estimate that originated from sampling sites and vertical interpolation of soil carbon stock was provided for the estimation of soil carbon stock on the Tibetan Plateau. To account for the uncertainty introduced by sampling sites, we adopted a bootstrap method (random sampling with replacement) to generate 1000 pseudo replicates, which were used to establish the SVM model in estimating the 30 cm soil carbon stock. We used soil carbon simulations from the SG3 scenario, with time-varying forcing of climate, land use history and atmospheric CO2 concentration, for the period 1975-2010, and resampled the output to 0.1o resolution to facilitate comparison with the observation-based predictions. We used the Comparison Map Profile (CMP) method to examine spatial similarity between the output of the models and our estimate."
