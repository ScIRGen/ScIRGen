Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness of only tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Because the observation scale of LAS aligns well with satellite pixel scales and the grid scales of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth at the pixel/grid scale for remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."

Then, the z0m over the entire experimental field is aggregated using the footprint weighting method, which considers the directional dependence of z0m due to the heterogeneity of roughness elements along different wind directions.",

                    "Answer": "Existing datasets from stations like Xiaotangshan provide valuable empirical data that can be used to analyze the directional characteristics of aerodynamic roughness length across different surface types. By characterizing the relationship between roughness elements and z0m, these datasets can be instrumental in developing heuristic parameterizations that improve the accuracy of remote sensing models. This can aid in better capturing the spatial variability of surface properties at larger scales.",

                    "Answer": "The data collected from the eddy covariance systems is initially at a high frequency of 10Hz. It is processed using software like Eddypro to transform it into 30-minute averaged data. This involves steps such as outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, angle correction, frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction, and density correction (WPL). The processed data is then subjected to quality assessment based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "Large aperture scintillometers (LAS) can measure sensible heat flux over larger scales compared to traditional eddy covariance systems. The representativeness is addressed by matching the LAS observation scale with satellite pixel scale and model grid scale. This allows the LAS data to serve as a ground truth for remote sensing estimates and model validation. The LAS data is processed using Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, incorporating atmospheric refractive index structure parameters and meteorological data.",

                    "Answer": "Aerodynamic roughness length (z0m) is calculated using data from experiments like the Xiaotangshan Experiment. It involves estimating z0m over different surface components based on roughness elements such as vegetation height and leaf area index. The individual z0m values are then aggregated over the entire experimental field using an analytical footprint model. This approach accounts for the direction-dependent nature of z0m due to the heterogeneity in roughness element size and spatial distribution.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of surface flux measurement, traditional methods include the eddy covariance system, which is internationally recognized for its reliability but has a limited spatial scale of representation (tens to hundreds of meters). The large aperture scintillometer (LAS), on the other hand, can measure surface fluxes on a regional scale (hundreds of meters to kilometers), making it suitable for matching satellite pixel scales and model grid scales. LAS's principle is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, which combines atmospheric refractive index structure parameters and related meteorological data to obtain regionally averaged sensible heat flux.",

                    "Answer": "Potential datasets include the Xiaotangshan Experiment data, which provides surface flux measurements over several land surfaces with varying vegetation covers, allowing for the calculation and analysis of z0m. LAS datasets from sites like Guantao and Arou offer regional scale flux measurements that can be used to validate remote sensing estimates and numerical models. Integrating datasets from both eddy covariance systems and LAS can help improve model parameterizations by providing ground truth values at different scales and conditions, thus enabling better model optimization and verification.",
