                    "Answer": "'平衡计算' refers to the method of balancing calculations that are used to model the distribution of permafrost. In the context of permafrost in the source region of the Yellow River, it involves using the WaSiM model to account for hydrothermal conditions and simulate the distribution of permafrost under various temperature increase scenarios (1, 2, 3°C). The calculations ensure that the model reflects the equilibrium state of permafrost for the year 2011, and these are adjusted for the hypothetical temperature rise conditions.",

It provides permafrost distribution data for the baseline year 2011 and under temperature increase scenarios of 1, 2, and 3°C. The model outputs data in ESRI ASCII format, which can be directly displayed in ArcMap, using a consistent projection coordinate system. Comparatively, other models might vary in their approach to simulating hydrothermal conditions and may require different types and volumes of input data, potentially affecting their accuracy and the ease of integration into different GIS platforms.",

                    "Answer": "Using a hydrological model like WaSiM to account for different temperature increase scenarios can improve the accuracy of predicting the spatial distribution of permafrost. By simulating the balance of water and heat conditions, researchers can better understand how permafrost distribution might change under warming conditions. The method allows for the exploration of permafrost depth and melting area distribution, providing a comprehensive view of how increased temperatures could affect permafrost regions over time.",

This results in the permafrost distribution being named as the 2011 state.
