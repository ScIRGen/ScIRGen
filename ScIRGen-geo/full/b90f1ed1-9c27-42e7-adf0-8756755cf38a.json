            "description": "The Qaidam Basin is a key area for understanding the paleoenvironmental and faunal history of the Tibetan Plateau. The fossil schizothoracine fish, Hsianwenia wui, evolved extraordinarily thickened bones to adapt to the aridification of the Qaidam Basin during the Pliocene. However, the nature of the bone thickening itself remains elusive. To promote the further investigation of the physiological mechanism of the pachyostosis and the phylogenetic interrelationships of Hsianwenia and all relevant cyprinids, here we present a comprehensive morphological study of Hsianwenia. We have new information on the anterior part of the cranial cavity, a large supraneural 3 in the Weberian apparatus, numerous procurrent caudal fin rays supported by the preural centrum (Pu) 5, and a neural arch on Pu2. We also find the differentiated pattern of the bone-thickening: the pachyostosis exists in the endoskeleton but not in the dermal skeleton; it is more obvious in ventral bones than in dorsal ones, when the thickening is present in the dorsally and ventrally grouped endoskeletal bones (e.g., the epineural and epipleural intermuscular bones). Considering the integrity of musculoskeletal system manipulating the chewing activities, we suspect that the thickened pharyngeal jaws and the hard food processing might be associated with the unique hind protrusion (cleithral “humeral” process) of the dermal pectoral girdle of Hsianwenia.",

This term is used to describe the increased bone thickness observed in the fossil Schizothoracinae fish species Hsianwenia wui from the Pliocene epoch in the Qaidam Basin, which is believed to have evolved as an adaptation to arid environmental conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The data suggest that Schizothoracinae fish, specifically Hsianwenia wui, evolved thickened endoskeletal bones as an adaptation to the aridification of the Qaidam Basin during the Pliocene period. The thickening is primarily observed in endoskeletal bones, unlike the exoskeletal ones, and is more pronounced in ventral bones compared to dorsal ones. This adaptation might be linked to the fish's dietary habits, specifically the need to grind hard food, as indicated by the presence of a unique humeral process above the pectoral fin.",

                    "Answer": "The collection and analysis of high-resolution morphological data for fossil fish species like Hsianwenia wui in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region can be challenging due to several factors. These include the need for detailed anatomical work to identify unique features such as the bifurcated olfactory tract and the development of certain vertebrae, the presence of differential thickening (pachyostosis) in internal versus external skeletal elements, and the requirement for high-quality visual data, such as original images or drawings, to ensure accurate representation and interpretation of these morphological characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "When high-resolution images are utilized as a primary data collection method for fossil studies, it can significantly enhance the clarity and detail of morphological features, leading to more precise anatomical reconstructions and identifications. In the case of Hsianwenia wui, this allows for the identification of specific anatomical features such as the bifurcated olfactory tract channel and the humeral process, which are crucial for understanding evolutionary adaptations and pachyostosis phenomena.",
