                    "Answer": "Accurately mapping desertification development levels in historical datasets from 1958 is complex due to several factors such as the quality and resolution of the original map data, the methods used for digitization, and the classification of land types like semi-shifting sandy land, grassland, and woodland. Additionally, accurately representing features like river systems, roads, and residential areas requires careful handling, as these features can significantly impact landscape interpretation and classification.",

Geographical features like rivers, roads, lakes, and railways are classified into separate layers (e.g., River_double.shp, Road.shp). The classification also extends to landforms and land use types, such as the degree of desertification (desertification1958.shp), which includes attributes like semi-shifting sandy land and grassland. Each feature is assigned specific attributes and codes, such as Types for desertification degree and Shapes for sandy landforms, ensuring detailed categorization and representation.",
