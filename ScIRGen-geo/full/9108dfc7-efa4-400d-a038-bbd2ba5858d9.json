            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace element data of adakite, zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, Hf isotopic composition and trace element data, and molybdenite Re-Os isotopic dating of Shiliu Cu-Mo deposit in Yangchun basin, Guangdong Province. The whole rock samples are acid intrusive rocks from Shilu deposit, including granodiorite and quartz diorite. Zircon minerals are selected from granodiorite and quartz diorite, molybdenite are from quartz vein and molybdenite vein in skarn. The major and trace elements of the whole rock were obtained by XRF and ICP-MS analysis, respectively. The whole rock F content was obtained by ion electrode analysis, and the Cl content was obtained by ion chromatography analysis. In situ U-Pb age and trace element data of zircons were obtained by LA-ICP-MS analysis, and in situ Hf isotopic composition was obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. The Re-Os isotopic composition of molybdenite was obtained by ICP-MS. The above data have been published in Acta geochimica, and the data are true and reliable. The data obtained can constrain the formation time and geochemical characteristics of Shilu intrusive rocks and deposits.",
            "instructions": "The data is stored in Excel file and can be opened directly in Excel workbook. The file named \"WR_MajTra\" file represents the major and trace element data of the whole rock. \"Zrn_Tra\" represents in-situ trace element geochemical data of zircon, \"Zrn_UPb\" represents zircon in-situ U-Pb age data, \"Zrn_Hf\" represents the in-situ Hf isotopic composition of zircons. \"Mo_ReOs\" represents the Re-Os isotopic composition of molybdenite.",
