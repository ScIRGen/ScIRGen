            "description": "This data is a high-resolution soil freeze/thaw (F/T) dataset in the Qinghai Tibet Engineering Corridor (QTEC) produced by fusing sentinel-1 SAR data, AMSR-2 microwave radiometer data, and MODIS LST products. Based on the newly proposed algorithm, this product provides the detection results of soil F/T state with a spatial resolution of 100 m on a monthly scale. Both meteorological stations and soil temperature stations were used for results evaluation. Based on the ground surface temperature data of four meteorological stations provided by the national meteorological network, the overall accuracy of soil F/T detection products achieved 84.63% and 77.09% for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. Based on the in-situ measured 5 cm soil temperature data near Naqu, the average overall accuracy of ascending and descending orbits are 78.58% and 76.66%. This high spatial resolution F/T product makes up traditional coarse resolution soil F/T products and provides the possibility of high-resolution soil F/T monitoring in the QTEC.",
