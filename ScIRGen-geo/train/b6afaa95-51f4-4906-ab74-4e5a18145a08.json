            "description": "Gwadar deep water port is located in the south of Gwadar city in the southwest of Balochistan province, Pakistan. It is 460km away from Karachi in the East and 120km away from Pakistan Iran border in the West. It is adjacent to the Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean in the South and the Strait of Hormuz and Red Sea in the West. It is a port with strategic position far away from Muscat, capital of Oman.\nThis data is the land cover data of Gwadar and its surrounding areas. The data is from globeland30 with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a data format of TIFF.\nThe classification images used in the development of globeland30 data set mainly include Landsat's TM5, ETM +, oli multispectral images and HJ-1 multispectral images. Using the Pok based classification method, the total volume accuracy is 83.50%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.78.",
