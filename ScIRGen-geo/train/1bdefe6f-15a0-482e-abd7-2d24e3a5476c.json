            "description": "Both a decrease of sea ice and an increase of surface meltwater, which may induce ice-flow speedup and frontal collapse, have a significant impact on the stability of the floating ice shelf in Greenland. However, detailed dynamic precursors and drivers prior to a fast-calving process remain unclear due to sparse remote sensing observations. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation on hydrological and kinematic precursors before the calving event on 26 July 2017 of Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland, by jointly using remote sensing observations at high-temporal resolution and an ice-flow model. Time series of ice-flow velocity fields during July 2017 were retrieved with Sentinel-2 observations with a sub-weekly sampling interval. The ice-flow speed quickly reached 30 m/d on 26 July (the day before the calving), which is roughly 10 times quicker than the mean glacier velocity.",

                    "Answer": "Using high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing observations, such as those from Sentinel-2, can significantly enhance the accuracy of monitoring rapid ice flow dynamics by providing detailed time series of ice flow velocity fields. This approach allows researchers to detect rapid changes, such as the sudden acceleration of ice flow observed before the 2017 Petermann Glacier calving event, where ice flow reached speeds approximately 10 times the average glacier velocity. However, challenges may include the integration of these high-resolution datasets with existing models and the need to ensure consistent and comprehensive coverage to capture rapid and transient events.",

This approach allows researchers to detect changes and potential triggers of glacier acceleration and frontal collapse, which are important for understanding the impact on the stability of Greenland's ice shelves. Due to the scarcity of remote sensing observations, understanding these precursors and drivers before rapid disintegration events is challenging, thus necessitating the use of combined methods to achieve detailed insights.",
