            "description": "The data are isotopic dating data, zircon HF-O isotopic data, rock whole rock major and trace data, rock whole rock isotopic geochemical data. The samples were collected from the Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks of gangmacuo, Qiangtang, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Radioisotope geochronology data were obtained by analyzing zircon U-Pb isotopes with secondary ion microprobe. HF and O isotopes of minerals were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and secondary ion probe analysis, respectively. The major, trace and isotopic geochemical data of whole rock were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the whole rock isotopic geochemical data were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Based on the data obtained, the existence of low oxygen magma and its accretion history in the early intraoceanic arc of Qiangtang paleoTethys ocean are identified.",

The file name \"zrtra\" represents zircon trace element data. The name of the file \"wrmajtraiso\" represents the major, trace and isotopic geochemical data of the whole rock.",
