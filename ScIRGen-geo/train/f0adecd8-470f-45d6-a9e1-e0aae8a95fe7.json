            "description": "This data is the whole rock major and trace element geochemical data of Yanshanian intermediate acid rocks in the northern margin of North China and its adjacent areas. The main data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, and the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can find out the temporal and spatial distribution of magmatism and the variation law of petrochemical composition in the study area, which plays an important role in tracing the dynamic process of tectonic magmatic process, analyzing the constraints of superposition and transformation of the Okhotsk ocean and Pacific tectonic domain on magmatism and mineralization in the area, and limiting the time limit of subduction, extinction and mutual transformation of the ancient oceanic crust, Finally, it provides key constraints for revealing the relationship between the deep process of Yanshan movement and magmatic mineralization.",

These variations are crucial for understanding the dynamics of tectonic-magmatic processes and the influence of tectonic domain overlaps and transitions, such as those involving the Okhotsk Ocean and the Pacific, on regional magmatic activities and mineralization processes.",

This integration can help in tracing the chemical composition changes of rocks, thus providing insights into the dynamics of tectonic-magmatic processes. It allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the constraints imposed by the overlapping and transformation of the Okhotsk and Pacific tectonic domains on magmatic activities and mineralization processes within the region.

These methods ensure data accuracy by using precise analytical techniques that minimize sample contamination and calibration errors. Additionally, the authenticity and reliability of the data are confirmed by their publication in high-level SCI journals, indicating that they have undergone rigorous peer review and validation processes.",
