The observation time is from August 28, 2018 to February 28, 2019, with an interval of 30 min. The depth of observation is 5 cm and 10 cm, totally 2 layers. The automatic observation network measures data both at the passive microwave pixel scale (e.g., SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, and FY-3) and active microwave satellite pixel scale (e.g., Sentinel-1). The observation area of the active and passive microwave pixels is 0.1°×0.1° and 0.25°×0.25°, respectively. There are 12 sites (named A (Active)) in active microwave pixels and 17 sites (named P (Passive)) in passive microwave pixels.",

This network provides detailed information on soil conditions, essential for land-atmosphere energy exchanges, vegetation growth monitoring, and climate modeling. In the Genhe watershed and Saihanba area, data is collected using ECH2O EC-5TM and XingShiTu probes, with information being recorded every 30 minutes at various soil depths.",

                    "Question": "How is 'permittivity data' relevant to soil moisture data collection?",

In the context of soil measurement, permittivity data collected by the XST data collector is transformed into soil moisture data, specifically volumetric water content, using a developed formula. This conversion is crucial for accurate monitoring and modeling in environmental studies.",

                    "Answer": "Active and passive microwave pixels refer to the spatial resolution and type of satellite-based observations used in soil moisture and temperature monitoring. Active microwave pixels, like those from Sentinel-1, involve radar-based sensing with a smaller observation area (0.1°×0.1°), while passive microwave pixels, such as those from SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, and FY-3, rely on natural emissions with a larger observation area (0.25°×0.25°). These pixels are used to distribute sensor observation points and analyze soil conditions over different spatial scales.",

ECH2O EC-5TM probes are used in the Genhe watershed, whereas XST probes are used in both the Genhe watershed and Saihanba area. The data from these probes are collected every 30 minutes, and the permittivity data are later converted to soil moisture data.

While each system may have its own calibration and data processing methods, using multiple systems can provide cross-validation opportunities and improve overall data reliability. However, it may also introduce variability that needs to be carefully managed to ensure data consistency across different observational networks.",
