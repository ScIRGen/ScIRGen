The spatial resolution is 250m. The variables include Start of Season (SOS) and End of Season (EOS). Two phenology estimating methods were used to MOD13Q1, polynomial fitting based threshold method and double logistic function based inflection method. There are 4 folders in the dataset. CJYYQ_phen is data folder for source region of the Yangtze River in the national park. HHYYQ_phen is data folder for source region of Yellow River in the national park. LCJYYQ_phen is data folder for source region of Lancang River in the national park. SJY_phen is data folder for the whole Three-River-Source region.\nData format is geotif.

                    "Answer": "Phenological data in the context of remote sensing refers to information about the timing of biological events in vegetation, such as the start and end of the growing season, which are derived from satellite observations. In this field, the data is estimated using products like MODIS NDVI and involves techniques such as polynomial fitting and double logistic curve fitting to extract relevant phenological metrics such as Start of Season (SOS) and End of Season (EOS).",

                    "Answer": "The phenology estimation methods involve two distinct approaches: one based on polynomial fitting with threshold extraction and the other on double logistic function fitting. A dataset utilizes both methods to estimate the start and end of the vegetation growing season in Sanjiangyuan National Park using MODIS NDVI products. The polynomial fitting method (indicated by 'poly' in file names) relies on extracting thresholds from polynomial curves, which can be sensitive to noise and may require careful selection of threshold levels for accuracy. In contrast, the double logistic method (indicated by 'sig' in file names) fits a curve that inherently captures the sigmoid nature of phenological changes, potentially offering more robustness to variability in the data. The choice between these methods can depend on the specific characteristics of the vegetation and environmental conditions in the study area, as well as the desired balance between sensitivity and robustness in capturing phenological events from remote sensing data.",

These methods may produce different results due to their distinct approaches to analyzing NDVI data.
