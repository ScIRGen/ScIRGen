In this context, they are used to analyze the magmatic rock formations and the evolutionary history of volcanic rocks, which can provide insights into the formation of large igneous provinces and the timing of geological collisions, such as the India-Eurasia collision.",

                    "Answer": "The absence of neutral rocks in large igneous provinces, such as those in the region of southern Tibet, might be due to geological processes that are not yet fully understood. This influences data collection methods for Sr-Nd isotopes as researchers focus on middle-basic rocks and volcanic rocks in collision zones to understand the genesis of these rocks and the spatiotemporal variations in enriched magma components. These factors necessitate precise testing methods like TIMS and MC-ICPMS, used by institutions like Carleton University and the Qingdao Institute of Oceanology, to ensure reliable data.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goal is to research the genesis of Lhasa neutral rocks in the large igneous province and investigate why neutral rocks are absent in such provinces. Additionally, it aims to understand the petrogenesis of volcanic rocks in collision zones and the spatio-temporal variation of enriched components in magma, which has significance in constraining the timing of the India-Eurasia collision using petrological evidence.",

The methods used are TIMS (Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry) and MC-ICPMS (Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry), which are chosen for their precision and ability to provide reliable isotopic measurements. These methods ensure data reliability and accuracy by utilizing advanced mass spectrometry techniques that allow for the detection and quantification of isotopes with high precision.",
