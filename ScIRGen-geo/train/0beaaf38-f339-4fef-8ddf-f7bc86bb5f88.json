            "description": "This dataset contains the LAI measurements from the Sidaoqiao in the downstream of the Heihe integrated observatory network from July 25 to October 20 in 2020. The site was located in Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The elevation is 870 m. There are 1 observation samples, around Sidaoqiao superstation (101.1374E, 42.0012N), which is about 30m×30m in size. Five sub-canopy nodes and one above-canopy node are arranged in each sample. \nThe data is obtained from LAINet measurements; the four-steps are performed to obtain LAI: the raw data is light quantum (level 0); the daily LAI can be obtained using the software LAInet (level 1); further the invalid and null values are screened and using the 7 days moving averaged method to obtain the processed LAI (level 2); for the multi LAINet nodes observation, the averaged LAI of the nodes area is the final LAI (level 3).\nThe released data are the post processed LAI products and stored using *.xls format.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Qu et al. (2014) for data processing) in the Citation section.",
