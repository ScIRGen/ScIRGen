                "Thousands of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a critical role in the regional water cycle, weather, and climate. However, the characteristics of the lake-atmosphere interaction over the high-altitude lakes are still unclear, which inhibits model development and the accurate simulation of lake climate effects. The Yellow River (YR) is the fifth-longest river in the world and the “lifeblood” of northern China. The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR), with an area of 12.2 ×104 km2, is the most important runoff-producing area for the YR, which accounts for only 16.4% of the YR basin area, but provides approximately 38% runoff. Sometimes called “China's Water Tower”, the SRYR is considered to be an \"extremely sensitive region\" to climate change. Lakes are a sentinel of climate change, which is a significant local climate driver due to the large thermal inertia and surface area. Ngoring Lake and Gyaring Lake in the SRYR, each at an elevation exceeding 4200 m above sea level, comprise the highest large fresh lakes in the TP. They are in the transition region of westerlies and the Asian monsoon climate and are sensitive to changes in atmospheric circulation. Three land-surface process observation sites (lake, grassland, and lakeside) have been established successively since 2010, helping to fill in the gap of long-term in-situ observations of lake-atmosphere interactions in the freshwater and outflow lakes in the TP."
