            "description": "The purpose of differential GPS positioning survey is to unify multiple survey areas into the same coordinate system and realize accurate absolute positioning through joint survey with national high-level control point coordinates. Under the national geodetic coordinate system of 2000, the accurate positioning of flux observation matrix, hulugou small watershed, tianmuchi small watershed and dayokou watershed and target is completed. In order to realize the geometric correction and absolute positioning of optical image, SAR image and airborne lidar data, the layout of ground control points and high-precision measurement are completed. In the middle reaches of the area, one national high-level control point is jointly surveyed in the five directions of East, South, West, North and middle.            Measuring instrument:            \nThere are 3 sets of triple R8 GNSS system.            \nMeasurement principle:            \nFor the control network encryption point, it is connected with the high-level known points in four quadrants around the survey area and distributed evenly in the survey area. For the ground control point (GCP), the obvious characteristic points (such as house corner, road intersection, inflection point, etc.) of the ground layout target and the independent ground objects are adopted and evenly distributed in the survey area. For the ground points with high accuracy requirements, the principle of average value of multiple (at least three) measurements is adopted.            \nMeasurement method:            \nIn the test area, the control network is encrypted, and GPS static measurement and national high-level control network are used for joint measurement and calculation. During measurement, multiple GPS receivers conduct static synchronous observation at different stations, and the observation time is strictly in accordance with the control network measurement specifications.            \nThe ground points in the test area are accurately located. GPS-RTK positioning technology is used and the national high-level control points are used to calibrate to the local coordinate system. When the mobile station obtains the fixed solution during the coordinate acquisition, the measurement is carried out again and the single measurement lasts for 5S.            \nMeasuring position:            \n(1) Flux observation matrix            \n17 stations, Las tower, waternet, soilnet and bnunet nodes in the core area of flux observation matrix; ground control points in CASI flight area; ground corner reflector positions in radar coverage area; ground target positions in lidar flight area.            \n(2) Hulugou small watershed            \nGround target location of lidar flight area.            \n(3) Tianmuchi small watershed            \nGround target location of lidar flight area.            \n(4) Dayokou Basin            \nSatellite image geometric correction ground control point.            \nData format:            \nGPS static survey, the original data format is \". Dat\" and \". T01\" (or \". T02\") files (or converted renix data) and \"field record\". GPS-RTK survey, the original project is \". Job\" file (or converted \".

The procedures include integrating multiple survey areas into the same coordinate system by linking them to national high-grade control point coordinates. The control network is densified using GPS static measurements synchronized across different stations, adhering to control network measurement standards. For ground control points, GPS-RTK positioning technology is used, calibrated with national high-grade control points, while the data collection occurs when the mobile station achieves a fixed solution and lasts for 5 seconds.",
