      "description": "Water scarcity，food crises and ecological deterioration caused by drought disasters are a direct threat to food security and socio-economic development. Improvement of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management is now urgently required. This article describes major scientific and technological progress in the field of drought disaster risk assessment. Drought is a worldwide natural disaster that has long affected agricultural production as well as social and economic activities. Frequent droughts have been observed in the Belt and Road area, in which much of the agricultural land is concentrated in fragile ecological environment. \nThe percentage of precipitation anomaly is the percentage of the precipitation between a certain period of time and the average climate precipitation of the same period divided by the average climate precipitation of the same period.Based on the daily rainfall data of GPM IMERG Final Run(GPM), this data set calculates the precipitation of the corresponding region, adopts the evaluation index of precipitation anomaly percentage grade, and analyzes the distribution characteristics of drought of different grades.\nThe data area is 34 key nodes of the pan-third pole (Abbas, Astana, Colombo, Gwadar, Mamba, Tehran, Vientiane, etc.).",
      "descriptionCn": "在全球变暖的背景下，干旱发生的频率和强度呈增加趋势，由于干旱灾害所引发的水资源匮乏、粮食危机、生态恶化（如荒漠化）等，直接威胁到国家的粮食安全和社会经济发展，干旱灾害风险评估及应急管理的技术水平亟待提高。“一带一路”沿线区域生态环境脆弱、农业耕地集中、干旱灾害频繁，利用遥感卫星监测大区域的干旱水平及其时空变化，对于科学掌握“一带一路”地区的干旱格局、区域分异特征，及其对农业耕地的影响具有重要的科学和现实意义。\n降水距平百分率是某时段降水量与同期气候平均降水量之差除以同期气候平均降水量的百分比。该数据集以GPM IMERG Final Run(GPM)日值降雨资料为基础，计算对应地区的降水量，采用降水距平百分率等级评价指标，分析了不同等级干旱的分布特征。\n数据的区域为泛第三极34个关键节点（阿巴斯、阿斯塔纳、科伦坡、瓜达尔、孟巴、德黑兰、万象等地区）。",
