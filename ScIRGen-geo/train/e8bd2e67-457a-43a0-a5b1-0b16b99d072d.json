            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with Envisat ASAR and MODIS was obtained in the arid region hydrological experimental area on May 24, 2008.\n     The Envisat ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 11:34 BJT.\n     Observation items included:\n     (1) The radiative temperature of Reaumuria soongorica and the bare soil in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot (HZZHMYD2)was collected using ThermaCAM SC2000 (1.2m above the ground, FOV = 24°×18°), along the diagonal (NW-SE). The data included raw data (read by ThermaCAM Researcher 2001), recorded data and the blackbody calibrated data (archived as Excel files).\n     (2) The radiative temperature by the automatic thermometer (FOV: 10°; emissivity: 0.95), were measured at nadir with time intervals of one second. Raw data, blackbody calibrated data and processed data were all archived as Excel files.\n     (3) The radiative temperature in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot by the handheld infrared thermometer (which belongs to BNU) along the diagonal (NW-SE). Raw data (.doc), blackbody calibrated data and processed data (in Excel format) were all archived.\n     (4) Soil moisture (0-40cm) by the cutting ring and the soil temperature by the thermocouple thermometer in Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi foci experimental area. Besides, (a) roughness of No. 1 and 2 Huazhizi desert plots was also measured by self-made instruments . Sample points were selected every 30m along the diagonal of each plot. (b) soil profile moisture (0-100cm) and the temperature in the maize field of Yingke oasis. (c) soil profile moisture (0-100cm) and the temperature in one orchard of Yingke Oasis. Data were all archived as Excel files.\n     (5) the photosynthetic rate of alfalfa and barley at Linze grass station by LI-6400. Raw data were archived in the user-defined format  (by notepat.exe) and processed data were as Excel files.\n     (6) ground object reflectance spectra of new-born rape and the bare land in Biandukou foci experimental area by ASD FieldSpec (350～2500 nm) from Institute of Remote Sensing Applications (CAS). Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro), and pre-processed data on reflectance were in Excel format.\n     (7) LAI by the measuring tape and the ruler in the alfalfa field of Linze grass station. The maximum length and width of alfalfa leaves and barley were measured. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     (8) surface roughness in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot with the self-made roughness board (Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, CAS), the digital camera and the compass. Sample points were selected at equal intervals along the diagonals and marked in the photos.",

                    "Answer": "Using Envisat ASAR and MODIS for synchronized observations allows researchers to gather comprehensive data on soil moisture, temperature, surface radiation, and roughness in arid regions. Envisat ASAR, with its AP mode and VV/VH polarization, provides detailed radar data, while MODIS offers complementary optical data. This combination enhances the understanding of hydrological processes by providing multi-dimensional insights into the surface conditions.",

                    "Answer": "Soil moisture is measured using the gravimetric method, which involves sampling and weighing, while soil temperature is measured using thermocouples. The gravimetric method provides direct measurements of soil moisture content by weight, which can be highly accurate but may be labor-intensive and less frequent. In contrast, thermocouples provide continuous, real-time temperature data, allowing for detailed temporal analysis. The implications for data accuracy and precision depend on the specific requirements of the study; gravimetric methods may offer more precise moisture content data, whereas thermocouples provide a dynamic view of temperature changes.",

                    "Answer": "Factors contributing to challenges in accurately measuring soil moisture and temperature in arid regions include variations in soil surface roughness, the need for precise calibration of instruments like thermal cameras and thermometers, and the heterogeneity of ground surface conditions such as vegetation cover and bare soil. The use of different instruments with varying field of view and sampling methods, such as diagonal line sampling and strip observations, also introduces complexities in data consistency and integration.",

Surface roughness is measured using self-made instruments and photographic methods. Sampling is conducted along diagonal lines at set intervals, and data are stored in Excel format. Soil moisture and temperature data are collected at varying depths, and surface roughness data is gathered using a self-made instrument and photographic method along specified diagonals. Collected data are processed and stored in Excel spreadsheets.",
