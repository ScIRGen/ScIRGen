            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the temperate steppe eddy covariance system (EC) belonging to the Qinghai Lake basin integrated observatory network from January 1 to October 14 in 2021. The site (100°14'8.99\"E, 37°14'49.00\"N) was located in Sanjiaocheng sheep breeding farm, Gangcha County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3210sm. The EC was installed at a height of 2.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3A &EC150) was about 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Data during December 18 to December 24, 2018 were missing due to the data collector failure.\nThe released data contained the following variables: DATE/TIME, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). The quality marks of sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and carbon flux are divided into three levels (quality marks 0 have good data quality, 1 have good data quality and 2 have poor data quality). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format.

                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance method is a data collection technique used in micrometeorological studies to measure and analyze vertical turbulent fluxes within the atmospheric boundary layer. It involves the use of specialized instruments like a sonic anemometer and gas analyzers to capture high-frequency data (e.g., 10 Hz) on wind components, temperature, and trace gas concentrations. This raw data is then processed using software like Eddypro to produce aggregated flux data, typically averaged over 30-minute intervals. The process includes steps such as outlier detection, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, virtual temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction, ensuring quality and accuracy in calculating fluxes like sensible and latent heat, and CO2.",

                    "Answer": "The high-frequency data, collected at 10Hz and processed into 30-minute intervals, allows for detailed analysis of atmospheric stability, turbulence characteristics, and interactions between the land surface and atmosphere. The data quality evaluation, including atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity testing (ITC), helps in understanding the dynamics of heat and mass exchanges at the site, revealing how these interactions vary over time and under different meteorological conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The key factors contributing to data quality issues in eddy covariance measurements in temperate grassland environments include instrument errors, environmental conditions like precipitation, and high missing data rates. Instrument errors, for instance, require the removal of erroneous data, while precipitation necessitates discarding data collected one hour before and after rain events. Additionally, missing data rates over 10% within a 30-minute interval also lead to data quality concerns. These issues are addressed using data processing steps such as outlier removal, delay time correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and tests for atmospheric stability and turbulent similarity characteristics.",

These processes can improve data quality by removing errors and ensuring consistency. However, each step might also introduce potential biases or errors if not properly calibrated or if assumptions do not hold, potentially affecting the accuracy and reliability of the final dataset.",

This aims to ensure data quality and reliability by conducting quality assessments like atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity tests, thereby supporting accurate measurement of variables like heat fluxes, water vapor, and carbon dioxide concentrations in temperate grasslands.",

Quality assessment includes evaluating atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Additionally, filtering is applied to remove data during instrument errors, periods surrounding precipitation, and data with more than 10% missing in the original 10Hz dataset. The processed data is averaged over 30-minute intervals, and quality flags are assigned to sensible heat, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes, ranging from 0 (good quality) to 2 (poor quality but better than interpolated data).",
