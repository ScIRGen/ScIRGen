An alternative is provided by active microwave measurements obtained via the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique, which can be processed up to resolutions of several meters. This high spatial resolution poses, however, restrictions on the revisit time when a single image swath is used, which was 35 days or larger for the first generation SAR systems onboard the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1/2) and the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1). In the design of the following generation of space borne SAR systems this issue was addressed by incorporating imaging modes for acquiring data at various spatial resolutions, swath widths and revisit times. However, the high spatial resolution imaging modes are less suited for large-scale monitoring purposes because its spatial coverage is restricted to about 100 km. In this context, wide swath (WS) and global monitoring (GM) modes provide a good compromise in terms of the spatial coverage (400 km), resolution (150 m for WS and 1000 m for GM) and revisit time (3–4 days)."

                "Soil moisture is a key state variable of the land surface controlling the partition of rainfall to subsoil drainage, surface runoff, or evaporation from the land surface. Understanding the dynamics of soil moisture is crucial for understanding the role of the hydrological cycle in the climate system and a variety of ecological and biogeochemical processes. Quantification of trends and variability in global soil moisture can contribute to a better understanding of the feedback between the water cycle and climate. Although the soil moisture dynamics at local scale can be measured with a certain degree of confidence, it is challenging to translate this point information to a larger spatial scale due to the lack of understanding of soil moisture variability within natural landscapes. Satellite remote sensing can be a powerful tool in fulfilling the need for a consistent global soil moisture data set because it allows monitoring the land surface at the relevant spatial and temporal scales. Recent progresses have already made available several global and continental scale soil moisture datasets from satellite observations not primarily designed for this purpose. The European Space Agency (ESA) operates currently a satellite, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, dedicated to global soil moisture monitoring and also the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) is in preparation of a similar soil moisture mission, Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP). Throughout the globe a number of intensive soil moisture networks have been developed for various purposes.",

These data sets were validated over regional limited networks (e.g. Albergel et al., 2009; Gruhier et al., 2010; Sinclair and Pegram, 2010) and evaluated against model data (Wagner et al., 2003; Rüdiger et al., 2009; de Rosnay et al., 2008). These studies found high correlations with in situ observations in semi arid regions and somewhat lower correlations in agricultural areas. Recent assimilation studies support the positive findings of the validation efforts (Drusch et al., 2008; Scipal et al., 2008). De Jeu et al.

These networks provide a representative coverage of the different climate and land surface hydrometeorological conditions on the Tibetan plateau. The obtained data are analysed to ensure the consistency with the regional climatic conditions and for the purpose of serving as reference for validation of coarse resolution satellite and modeling soil moisture products.

In winter period, AMSR-E grossly overestimates the in-situ measurements, while ASCA T-L2 estimates are close to the in-situ measurements since the area is frozen and the assumption of dry soil in ASCA T-L2 retrieval appears reasonable. The ASCA T-L2 products systematically overestimate the surface soil moisture in this network area in the monsoon period.",

For the cold humid Maqu network area it is concluded that soil moisture products from AMSR-E, ASCA T-L2 have comparable accuracy as reported by previous studies in the humid monsoon period. The AMSR-E products overestimate and ASCA T-L2 products underestimate soil moisture in the winter period significantly. But the opposing behaviours of both data sets may be used to generate a more useful data for the winter periods. A preliminary evaluation of SMOS data indicates its promising feature, but apparently needs much more data to derive more concrete conclusions."

                "Understanding the physics and dynamics of soil moisture is crucial to understanding the role of the hydrological cycle in the climate system. With increasing evidence of climate change, it becomes more urgent to quantify the critical role of soil moisture in climate, because the response of the hydrological cycle to global warming is expected as far reaching. Although it is easy to observe soil moisture dynamics at the local scale, it is challenging to translate this point scale understanding to natural landscapes due to the lack of understanding of soil moisture variability at larger spatial scales. Models, satellite remote sensing, and land data assimilation are necessary tools to produce spatiotemporally consistent soil moisture information. Soil moisture analysis at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) aims to represent spatiotemporally consistent soil moisture information, served as land surface initialization for numerical weather prediction models. The optimum interpolation (OI) scheme is the previous operational soil moisture analysis scheme at ECMWF, using the increments of the screen-level parameters analysis as input. The current soil moisture analysis scheme is a point-wise extended Kalman filter (EKF) with the same screen-level parameters analysis. However, the current EKF scheme opens up the possibility to combine remote sensing data (e.g., satellite derived soil moisture data) with screen-level proxy observations, and it better constrains the soil moisture fields. De Rosnay et al. [2012b] also investigated the impact of including the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture data on the ECMWF land surface analysis system, and found a neutral impact on both soil moisture analysis and screen-level parameters."

                    "Answer": "The challenges in translating point-scale soil moisture observations to larger spatial scales include the lack of understanding of soil moisture variability within natural landscapes. Models designed to simulate local dynamics using optimized parameters usually fail in this task due to unexplained variations among estimates produced by different models. Satellite remote sensing can provide some advantages, but current understanding of how microwaves are attenuated by vegetation is still limited, further complicating accurate large-scale soil moisture estimation.",

                    "Answer": "Global coarse resolution soil moisture products may exhibit uncertainty in cold semiarid regions due to the unique climatic and hydrological conditions that are not well-represented in these datasets. The lack of in-situ reference data in such extreme climate conditions makes it difficult to validate and calibrate satellite-derived soil moisture estimates, resulting in unreported uncertainties. Expectations for these datasets may need adjustment to reflect the necessity for rigorous assessment and validation against in-situ data to ensure consistency with actual hydrological conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The merging of different satellite datasets with model-simulated soil moisture products over the Tibetan Plateau might fail to meet expected outcomes due to the inherent difficulties in retrieving soil moisture from partially-frozen land surfaces. The systematic differences between datasets can prevent a statistically-optimal analysis, necessitating corrections that might not always be feasible. Additionally, the limited availability of satellite-based soil moisture estimates over the Tibetan Plateau within these merged products poses a significant challenge.",

                    "Answer": "The current soil moisture retrieval algorithms for satellite data face challenges in cold and semiarid regions due to the lack of understanding of soil moisture variability and surface conditions such as partial freezing. These conditions introduce systematic errors and uncertainties in satellite-derived estimates. The algorithms need rigorous assessment and refinement with in-situ data to improve their accuracy and consistency with actual hydrological situations, particularly during winter periods.",

                    "Answer": "Merging different satellite datasets with model-simulated soil moisture data can enhance understanding by providing a more comprehensive and accurate representation of soil moisture dynamics. This approach allows for scaling and blending strategies to correct exaggerated variations and align satellite observations with in-situ measurements. It addresses the limitations of individual datasets and can help eliminate overestimations, leading to improved seasonal and spatial consistency in soil moisture products across the Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The retrieval of soil moisture data from satellite observations over the Tibetan Plateau is challenging due to partially frozen land surfaces. The inherent difficulties are addressed by using a combination of in situ measurements and model simulations to constrain and validate satellite-derived datasets. Techniques such as scaling and blending of multiple data sources, including AMSRE, ASCAT, and ERA-Interim, help in correcting discrepancies and improving the accuracy of satellite data over these regions.",

These in-situ datasets provide high temporal and spatial resolution data on soil moisture and temperature across different climatic zones, which can serve as reference points for validating satellite data. Additionally, datasets from satellite missions like AMSR-E, ASCA T-L2, and SMOS, which offer lower spatial resolution observations, can be used in conjunction with in-situ data for comprehensive validation efforts.",

                    "Answer": "A research approach to merging satellite and model-simulated soil moisture datasets over the Tibetan Plateau would involve several steps: firstly, generating in-situ soil moisture data climatology at a spatial resolution of 0.25° using networks like Tibet-Obs. Then, scaling ERA-Interim soil moisture data to match this climatology, followed by applying CDF matching to adjust AMSRE and ASCAT satellite datasets. The strategy includes using the Triple Collocation method to determine relative errors among data sources and employing least squares blending to integrate the scaled satellite and model data. This approach aims to address the unique challenges posed by the plateau's climatic conditions, such as exaggerated satellite data variations due to frozen surfaces.",
