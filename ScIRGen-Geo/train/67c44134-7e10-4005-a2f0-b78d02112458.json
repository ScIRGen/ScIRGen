All the land surface temperature data will be used for validation of the retrieved land surface temperature from thermal infrared sensor and the analysis of the scale effect of the land surface temperature, and finally serve for the validation of the plausibility checks of the surface temperature product from remote sensing.\n1. Observation time and other details\nOn 25 June, 2012, ditch and asphalt road surface temperatures were observed once every five minutes using handheld infrared thermometers recorded.\nOn 26 June, 2012, ditch and asphalt road surface temperatures were observed once every five minutes using handheld infrared thermometers while greenhouse film and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every one second using self-recording point thermometer.\nOn 29 June, 2012, concrete floor surface temperatures were observed continuously using handheld infrared thermometers during the sensor of TASI go into the region.
