            "description": "The data of grassland resources in Kekexili area of Qinghai Province come from the comprehensive scientific investigation of Kekexili area from May to August 1990. The formation and evolution of flora characteristics are not only related to the evolution of plants, but also strictly restricted by the past and modern ecological conditions. Because of the high cold and drought, the flora of Kekexili area is relatively poor. The grassland in Kekexili area of Qinghai Province is a natural ecosystem which has not been disturbed by human beings. In this system, grass is the material basis for the survival and reproduction of all kinds of herbivorous wild animals and grazing livestock. Therefore, to understand and master the number, quality and distribution characteristics of grassland resources in this area is the basic condition for rational utilization of grassland resources and establishment of nature reserves.",

                    "Answer": "The data on grassland resources in the Qinghai Hoh Xil region were collected through a comprehensive scientific survey conducted from May to August 1990. This survey aimed to understand the characteristics and evolution of the plant flora, which are influenced by past and present ecological conditions. The region's high-cold and arid conditions result in a relatively impoverished plant flora, making it crucial to assess the quantity, quality, and distribution of grassland resources for sustainable use and the establishment of nature reserves.",

                    "Answer": "In high-altitude, arid regions such as the Qinghai Kekexili area, data collection methods may focus on understanding the less disturbed natural ecosystem, where grassland resources serve as the primary sustenance for wild herbivores and livestock. This involves comprehensive scientific surveys conducted over months to account for the ecological characteristics dictated by both historical and current conditions. In contrast, data collection in temperate or human-impacted ecosystems might incorporate additional considerations for human activities and their effects, potentially requiring different methodologies to account for richer biodiversity and more dynamic ecological changes.",

                    "Answer": "The ecological constraints and evolution of plant flora in the Qinghai Kekexili region are influenced by both past and modern ecological conditions. The high-altitude, arid environment has resulted in a relatively impoverished plant flora. The data collection during 1990 aimed to understand the characteristics and evolution of the plant flora, suggesting that these factors are crucial for examining the natural ecosystem's resilience and adaptation capabilities in an undisturbed state. It also highlights the importance of this understanding for the sustainable use of grassland resources and the establishment of nature reserves.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods were influenced by the need to understand the characteristics and evolution of the plant flora in relation to both past and current ecological conditions, particularly given the region's high-altitude, arid environment. The area being a mostly undisturbed natural ecosystem required methods that could effectively identify and assess the quantity, quality, and distribution of grassland resources, which are crucial for the survival and reproduction of wild herbivores and grazing livestock.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives behind collecting data on grassland resources in the Qinghai Kekexili region from May to August 1990 include understanding the characteristics and evolution of plant flora, which are influenced by both evolutionary processes and ecological conditions. The region's grassland serves as a crucial natural ecosystem minimally disturbed by human activity, providing essential resources for various wild herbivores and grazing livestock. Understanding the quantity, quality, and distribution of grassland resources is fundamental for their rational use and for establishing nature reserves.",
