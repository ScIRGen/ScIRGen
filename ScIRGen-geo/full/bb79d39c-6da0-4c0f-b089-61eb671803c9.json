            "description": "The landform information integration in western China was completed by a team led by Dr. Xie chuanjie, from the institute of geography, resources and environment, Chinese academy of sciences.It includes 1:400,000 national geomorphologic database and 1:100,000 western geomorphologic database. 1:400,000 geomorphologic data are \"China geomorphologic map (1:400,000)\" edited by LI Bingyuan and \"China and its adjacent areas geomorphologic map (1:400,000)\" edited by CHEN Zhiming. Scan and register the data, vectorize all the registered maps by using ArcMap software, and establish their own classification and code system. According to map spots (common staining) and symbols, geomorphic types are divided into basic geomorphic types and morphological structure types (points, lines and planes).\n\n1:1000000 western geomorphic data is integrated and updated by digital geomorphology based on multi-source data such as remote sensing image and adopts hierarchical interpretation method.Plains and mountains;Primary geomorphic types (25 types),10 genetic types: secondary genetic types: subdivision of morphological differences. The type of geomorphic material whose composition or lithology is determined.\n\nConducted among 16 landscape points of interpretation work, their Numbers are: 45 (Kathmandu), G - G - 46 (the) wrong, H - 44 (pli), 45 (xigaze), H - H - 46 (Lhasa), H - 47 (qamdo), 43 (Islamabad), I - I - 44 (lion spring river), 45 (change), I - I - (amdo) 46, 47 (yushu), J - I - 43 (kashi) (wada), J, J - 44-45 (JuMo), 46 (golmud), J J - - 47 (xining)",
