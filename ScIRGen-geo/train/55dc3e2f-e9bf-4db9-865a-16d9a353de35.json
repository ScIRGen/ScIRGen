            "description": "The data in this paper include the major and trace elements of the whole rock, the whole rock SR – nd Pb isotope and zircon u – Pb age and Hf isotope data, and the detrital zircon U-Pb age data. The samples were collected from basalt and andesite in the Salt Lake area of Western Tibet. Zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotope data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The whole rock SR – nd Pb isotopic compositions were obtained by sample separation and purification and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The age, origin and formation background of magmatism in the region can be defined by the data obtained.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in collecting geochemical data for early Cretaceous magmatic rocks in this region may arise from the complexity of accurately measuring whole-rock major and trace elements, as well as isotopic compositions (such as Sr–Nd-Pb) and zircon U–Pb ages and Hf isotopic data. These measurements require precise instrumentation like X-ray fluorescence spectrometers, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers, and laser ablation techniques, which must be properly calibrated and maintained to ensure accurate results. Additionally, the accessibility of sampling locations and the preservation of sample integrity in the harsh environmental conditions of Tibet can also pose significant difficulties.",
