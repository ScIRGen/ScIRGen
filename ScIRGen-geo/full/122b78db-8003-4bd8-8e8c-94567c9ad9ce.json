            "description": "This dataset contains daily land surface evapotranspiration products of 2019 in Qilian Mountain area. It has 0.01 degree spatial resolution. The dataset was produced based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method by fusing six satellite-derived evapotranspiration products including RS-PM (Mu et al., 2011), SW (Shuttleworth and Wallace., 1985), PT-JPL (Fisher et al., 2008), MS-PT (Yao et al., 2013), SEMI-PM (Wang et al., 2010a) and SIM (Wang et al.2008). The input variables for the evapotranspiration products include MODIS products and China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (He Jie, Yang Kun. China Meteorological Forcing Dataset. Cold and Arid Regions Science Data Center at Lanzhou, 2011. doi:10.3972/westdc.002.2014.db).",

This approach contrasts with using a single method, which may be limited by its specific assumptions and sensitivity to certain variables. The integration can potentially provide a more robust estimate by leveraging diverse data inputs, including MODIS-derived factors like NDVI, Albedo, LAI, and PAR, as well as high-resolution meteorological data, thus offering a comprehensive view of evapotranspiration patterns in the Qilian Mountain region.",

The process is driven by data inputs that include MODIS data (such as NDVI, Albedo, LAI, PAR) and a high spatiotemporal resolution meteorological dataset for the Chinese region.

This approach leverages GPR to synthesize the outputs, potentially increasing accuracy and robustness in the estimation of daily surface evapotranspiration for regions like Qilian Mountain.
