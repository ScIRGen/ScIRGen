Sr and nd elements were extracted by cation resin exchange column with hydrochloric acid as eluent. The experimental process is described in Wei Gangjian et al. (2002) and Li et al. (2004). 87Sr / 86Sr and 143Nd / 144Nd ratios were corrected by 86Sr / 88Sr = 0.119 4 and 146nd / 144Nd = 0.721 9, respectively, while 87Sr / 86Sr and 143Nd / 144Nd ratios were corrected by NBS SRM 987 standard 87Sr / 86Sr = 0.710 25 and shin Etsu jndi-1 standard 143Nd / 144Nd = 0.512 115, respectively (yuan et al., 2010).",
