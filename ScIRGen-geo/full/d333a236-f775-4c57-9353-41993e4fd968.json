            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in No. 1 and 2 quadrates of the Biandukou foci experimental area on Oct. 17, 2007 during the pre-observation period. \n     The ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 23:04 BJT. Both the quadrates were divided into 3×3 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. 25 sampling points were chosen, including centers and corners.\n     Simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected: the soil temperature , volumetric soil moisture (cm^3/cm^3), soil salinity (s/m), soil conductivity (s/m) by the Hydra probe, the surface radiative temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer, gravimetric soil moisture, volumetric soil moisture, and soil bulk density by drying soil samples from the cutting ring (100cm^3). Meanwhile, vegetation parameters as height, coverage and water content were also observed. \n     Those provide reliable ground data for the development and validation of soil moisture, soil freeze/thaw algorithms and the forward model from active remote sensing approaches.",

This involves measuring various parameters on the ground, such as soil temperature, soil moisture, soil salinity, and surface radiation temperature, using instruments like the Hydra probe and handheld infrared thermometers. These measurements are synchronized with the satellite's overpass to ensure accurate comparison and analysis.",

In this context, instruments like the Hydra probe are used to measure soil temperature, volumetric soil moisture, soil salinity, and soil electrical conductivity due to their ability to provide precise and relevant data that aligns with the satellite's measurement capabilities and objectives.",

This approach allows for precise validation of remote sensing data, enhancing the development of models for soil moisture and freeze-thaw state detection by providing detailed information on soil temperature, volumetric water content, salinity, and electrical conductivity.",
