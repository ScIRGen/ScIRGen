            "description": "The granitoids in Hengduan Mountain area were developed from Precambrian to tertiary, and the lithology was very developed from neutral, acidic to alkaline, and distributed in bands. Because of the change of granite type caused by tectonic evolution, multiple genetic types of granite are distributed in the same rock belt, thus forming a composite rock belt.\nThis data set is the data set of major element characteristics of some moderately acidic intrusive rocks in Hengduan Mountain area. By using the quantitative classification method of stricksen chemistry and minerals, the granite rocks in this area are divided into diorite, tonalite, granodiorite, monzogranite, potassic granite, alkali feldspar syenite, etc. This paper mainly introduces the chemical composition of these rocks and the lithological changes of the rock mass at each stage in the sampling area. The original data of this data set is digitized from the book \"geochemistry of granite in Hengduan Mountain Area\". This data set provides data and analysis for studying the chemical composition of various types of granite in Hengduan Mountain area, and is valuable reference data for research in this field.",
            "instructions": "The dataset is stored in Excel format and contains 14 workbooks, which respectively introduce the chemical composition of different granites in Hengduan Mountains, and also introduce the lithology changes of rock mass in different periods at the site.",

                    "Answer": "The Strieckeisen chemical-mineral quantitative classification method is considered effective in this context as it allows for a detailed categorization of granitic rocks into various types such as diorite, tonalite, granodiorite, monzogranite, syenogranite, alkali feldspar granite, and alkali feldspar syenite. This classification provides comprehensive data on the chemical composition of these rocks, which is valuable for understanding the geological evolution and variety within the Hengduan Mountains.",
