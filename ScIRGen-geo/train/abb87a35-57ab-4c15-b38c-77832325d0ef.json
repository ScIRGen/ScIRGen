            "description": "This data includes the whole rock major and trace geochemical data, muscovite and garnet major and trace element data, niobate group minerals and monazite radioisotope dating data. The samples were collected from the dome of the Cuona cave in eastern Tibet. The major geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, the trace elements are obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the major elements of muscovite and garnet are obtained by electron probe analysis, Trace element data and radioisotope dating of monazite and niobate group minerals were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. According to the data obtained, the formation age of be NB TA metallogenic pegmatite can be defined as Miocene, and the mineralization is controlled by high degree differentiation of magma and hydrothermal process.",

Additionally, the intricate processes of magmatic differentiation and hydrothermal activities that control mineralization can add complexity to data interpretation. The collection of samples from remote areas like eastern Tibet also poses logistical challenges.",
