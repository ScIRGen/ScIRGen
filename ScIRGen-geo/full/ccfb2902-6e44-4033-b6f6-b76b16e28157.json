RTSs were visually detected based on the presence of recently exposed sediments, poorly developed vegetation, and distinct headwalls. To avoid misdelineation of the RTS, the entire permafrost region of the QTP was divided into a large number of grids measuring 5 × 5 km each. Grids with slope degrees below 1° or higher than 15° were excluded because RTSs are rarely found at these slopes according to our previous study and field investigations. RTSs in the remaining grids were detected and sketched by the first author and then examined by at least two other experienced authors. Once a RTS was identified, it was assigned a unique number and classified based on its initiation such as next to a river (R), by lake erosion (L), and after the occurrence of  active-layer detachment slide (A).",

                "The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) is referred to as the world's “third pole” and is characterized by a warming rate that has been more than twice the global average during the past five decades. Significant changes in air temperature have resulted in wide permafrost degradation thereon. Retrogressive thaw slump refers to the failure of a hill slope associated with exposed ground ice thawing and the subsequent slumping of thawed soil. It is a common landform associated with permafrost thawing or degradation in permafrost regions. Widespread RTS activity has been observed in most Arctic and subarctic permafrost regions in recent years in association with persistent climate warming and permafrost degradation. Early studies on RTSs in the permafrost region of the QTP mainly focused on the Qinghai–Tibet Engineering Corridor and generally treated the RTS as an adverse engineering geological phenomenon. Due to its unique and high-altitude environment, the QTP accounts for more than half of the alpine permafrost in the world, with a specific permafrost area of ∼1.06 × 10^6 km^2. Permafrost on the QTP is relatively ice-rich and field monitoring results confirmed that the ground ice content is mainly controlled by the moisture availability, slope direction, and fine-particle content. The permafrost in the QTP is generally within a few degrees below the freezing point and has experienced noticeable warming over the past decades. The active layer thickness (ALT) of permafrost on the QTP generally ranges from 1 to 4 m, with an average value of ∼2.2 m."

                "Due to the increasing air temperatures, retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) have become more common on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), but their inventory, frequency, and initiation have not been fully investigated. Therefore, we compiled an inventory of active RTSs within the permafrost area on the QTP with a size of 1.06 × 10^6 km^2 based on high-resolution satellite image interpretation and field Global Position System positioning. We also explored the correlations between the spatial distribution of RTSs and terrain factors, surface deposits, and the permafrost ice content. To further investigate the frequency of RTS occurrence, the annual dynamics of RTSs in three typical areas between 2008/2013 and 2021 were documented using a time series of satellite imagery. This is the first study in which a large-scale RTS data set is provided and the first one in which the distribution and frequency of RTSs on the entire QTP are reported."

            "challenges": [
                "RTSs were not considered to be widespread throughout the QTP. However, RTS activity has been observed more frequently in recent years. Although the distribution and growth of RTSs have been reported in certain small regions, they have not been quantified or effectively analyzed within the entire permafrost region of the QTP. Because of these diverse radiometric characteristics within one RTS and spectra similar to those of other land cover types, it is difficult to automatically map RTSs in images using traditional computer classification methods. Training samples and the algorithm's code must be significantly adjusted when used for different images and locations, which makes it difficult to utilize this deep learning algorithm for the large-scale mapping of RTSs throughout the entire QTP."

In addition, time series of orthographic satellite images (resolution ≥2.5 m) from 2008 or 2013 to 2021 were acquired to estimate the annual changes of RTSs in three typical regions. We visually interpreted RTSs in this study. During the three surveys, 189 RTSs were recorded in the field. For the implementation of the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program, the overall distribution of RTSs in the central QTP was systematically investigated between January and June 2021."

Most of the RTSs occur in regions with elevations ranging from 4,600 to 5,100 m along north-facing slopes varying from 3° to 8°. The number of RTSs and their affected areas increased by 4 and 6 times, respectively, in three densely distributed RTS regions from 2008/2013 to 2021. We observed that the number and areas of RTSs significantly increased during the last 12 years. We also determined that such increases mainly occurred in 2010 and 2016 when the air temperature was extremely high. Anomalously high air temperatures during the thawing season might be the main reason for the recent RTS acceleration on the QTP."
