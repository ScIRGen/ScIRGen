            "description": "A multi-layer soil particle-size distribution dataset (sand, silt and clay content), based on USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) standard for regional land and climate modelling in China. was developed The 1:1,000,000 scale soil map of China and 8595 soil profiles from the Second National Soil Survey served as the starting point for this work. We reclassified the inconsistent soil profiles into the proper soil type of the map as much as possible because the soil classification names of the map units and profiles were not quite the same.\nThe sand, silt and clay maps were derived using the polygon linkage method, which linked soil profiles and  map polygons considering the distance between them, the sample sizes of the profiles, and soil classification information. For comparison, a soil type linkage was also generated by linking the map units and soil profiles with the same soil type. The quality of the derived soil fractions was reliable. Overall, the map polygon linkage offered better results than the soil type linkage or the Harmonized World Soil Database. The dataset, with a 1-km resolution, can be applied to land and climate modelling at a regional scale.\nData characteristics：\nprojection：projection\nCoverage: China\nResolution: 0.00833 (about 1 km)\nData format: FLT, TIFF\nValue range: 0%-100%\nDocument describing：\nFloating point raster files include:\nSand1.
