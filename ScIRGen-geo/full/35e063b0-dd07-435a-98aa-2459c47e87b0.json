Samples are collected in 500ml volumes, sealed, labeled with the sampling time, location, and identification number, and sent to qualified laboratories for testing. The data includes chemical analyses of cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+), anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, HCO3-, CO32-), pH, and trace elements to understand the distribution patterns of water chemistry in the study area.",

By obtaining data on cations such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and anions such as F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, HCO3-, CO32-, as well as trace elements, researchers aim to gain insights into the hydrological characteristics of the region. This information can be crucial for assessing water quality, understanding geochemical processes, and informing water resource management strategies in the Ma Zong Mountain research area.",

                    "Answer": "During the hydrological survey conducted in the Ma Zong Mountain region, water samples were collected from each groundwater and surface water outcrop point. A 500ml water sample was taken according to sampling requirements, sealed, and labeled with the sampling time, location, and number. These samples were then sent to a qualified laboratory for chemical analysis to determine the concentrations of cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+), anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, HCO3-, CO32-), and trace elements. This approach helps understand the hydrochemical distribution patterns of surface and groundwater in the study area.",
