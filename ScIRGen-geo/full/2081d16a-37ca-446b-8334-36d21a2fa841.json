The aim is to represent a range of ecological roles and environmental adaptations. Species such as 白羊草 (white sheep grass), 紫花苜蓿 (alfalfa), 玉米 (corn), and various shrubs and trees are included to understand their physiological responses to arid conditions. This selection helps provide insights into the landscape's ecological dynamics and resilience to climate variations.",

The project aims to understand the dynamics of photosynthesis in these environments from 2002 to 2005.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection process involves monitoring the photosynthesis of plant species like 白羊草, 紫花苜蓿, 玉米, among others, in arid regions such as Inner Mongolia. Key data include measured and simulated net photosynthetic rates, transpiration rates, light quantum intensity, atmospheric CO2 partial pressure, stomatal conductance, air chamber temperature, leaf temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure. This process requires accurate instrumentation to measure these parameters at different sites, such as 安塞站, 伊金霍洛旗石灰庙, and 准格尔旗皇甫川五分地沟, and involves handling environmental challenges like maintaining instrument calibration and data accuracy in field conditions over the period from 2002 to 2005.",
