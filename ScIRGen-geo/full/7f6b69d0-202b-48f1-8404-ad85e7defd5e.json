                    "Answer": "In the context of hydrological modeling, '地表-地下水耦合模拟' refers to the integrated simulation of surface water and groundwater interactions. This involves using models to simulate the exchange processes between surface water bodies (such as rivers and lakes) and groundwater systems, considering factors like infiltration, evaporation, soil moisture, and water extraction. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the water cycle and its components within a specific geographic area, such as the Zhangye Basin, over a defined time period.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial precision of 1km×1km grids allows for detailed representation of subsurface hydrological processes in the Zhangye Basin, with each grid capturing localized variations in key variables such as soil moisture, groundwater levels, and surface-subsurface water exchanges. This granularity enables researchers to infer the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological responses and assess the impact of different land cover and land use types on water resources. It also facilitates the identification of critical areas for water management and conservation within the basin.",

                    "Answer": "Using a coupled surface-groundwater model with daily time steps and spatial grids to simulate key hydrological variables in a basin like Zhangye Basin potentially improves the accuracy and reliability of hydrological simulations by providing detailed temporal and spatial insights. The model can capture daily variations and interactions between surface and groundwater, offering a comprehensive understanding of hydrological processes. However, the accuracy is dependent on the quality and resolution of input data, the model's ability to accurately represent the physical processes, and the calibration and validation of the model using observed data.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to conduct a coupled surface-groundwater simulation for the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, specifically focusing on the Zhangye Basin. The simulation aims to understand and quantify key hydrological variables such as surface infiltration, actual evapotranspiration, average soil moisture content, surface-groundwater exchange, shallow groundwater levels, and flow values at specific locations, which are crucial for effective water resource management and planning in the region.",

The spatial precision for the underground part uses a 1km×1km grid with five layers, totaling 25,800 grids, of which 9,106 are active. For the surface part, hydrological response units (HRU) serve as the basic computation units, totaling 588, with each HRU covering several to tens of square kilometers.",
