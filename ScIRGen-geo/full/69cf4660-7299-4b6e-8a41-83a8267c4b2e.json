                    "Answer": "The collection of high-resolution albedo data, such as that from the midstream core areas of river basins, involves using advanced remote sensing technologies like high-spectral airborne data. This approach allows for detailed spatial resolution, in this case, 5 meters, which suggests a necessity for precise instrumentation and calibration techniques to accurately capture and interpret surface reflectance. Challenges likely include dealing with atmospheric conditions, ensuring consistent data quality across different flight missions, and processing large volumes of data. These factors necessitate robust data processing algorithms and careful planning in data collection to ensure accurate representation of the surface characteristics.",
