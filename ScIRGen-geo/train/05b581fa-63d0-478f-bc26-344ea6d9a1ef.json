            "description": "The age constraints for Cenozoic exhumation history of the northern Tibetan Plateau provides evidence for growth process of the plateau and interaction process of tectonics-climate-erosion in this region. Apatite fission track thermochronology has a relative lower closure temperature of ~100 °C, thus is capable of recording the exhumation process of upper crust. We collected 26 sedimentary samples in the Hongliugou section in northern Qaidam Basin, which consist of strata from the Lulehe Formation to Shizigou Formation. These samples were fission track dated using the external detector method in the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The result shows fission track central age of these samples range in 36.4 ± 2.0 Ma to 78.0 ± 2.8 Ma. Most of our sample failed the chi-square test, indicating a mixture of multiple sources with different cooling ages. We use the binomial fitting method to decompose the mixture single-grain ages and obtained 55 age components. Decomposed component age of these detrital samples ranges in 21.2 ± 2.9 Ma to 102.8 ± 9.0 Ma. Integrated analysis of the fission track ages and confined track length indicates that samples in the upper 2500 m of the section had not affected by burial annealing after deposition, while that in the lower 2500 m were partial annealed after deposition. Unannealed fission track ages showing “static peaks” in ~60-50 Ma and ~40-36 Ma, which indicates the source of these detritus, the Qilian Shan, have experienced significant rock exhumation in these two stages in respective. This study suggests that tectonic deformation initiated in the northern Tibetan Plateau in early Cenozoic, which synchronous with India-Asia collision. Thus we suggest the Qilian Shan serves as the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau since the early Cenozoic.",

                    "Answer": "The observed cooling ages and static peaks in fission track ages indicate that significant rock exhumation events occurred in the Qilian Mountains during the periods of ~60-50 Ma and 40-36 Ma. This suggests that the tectonic deformation in the northern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau began in the early Cenozoic, coinciding with the collision time of the Indian and Eurasian plates. It implies that the Qilian Mountains served as the northern boundary of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the early Cenozoic.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of thermochronological data collection is influenced by factors such as the low closure temperature of apatite fission track thermochronology (~100℃), which records shallow crustal exhumation processes. The presence of multiple cooling ages due to mixed detrital source regions can also affect accuracy, as indicated by the failure of most samples in the chi-squared test. Additionally, the degree of post-depositional annealing in samples, as seen in samples below 2500m in the section, can influence the accuracy of the ages obtained.",

                    "Answer": "Using multiple cooling age groups derived from single-grain age decomposition allows for a more detailed understanding of the source area dynamics, as it can reveal complex histories of exhumation and erosion. This approach can indicate significant rock exhumation events at different time periods and help identify periods of static conditions. Such detailed age information provides insights into the timing and extent of tectonic activities, such as the early Cenozoic tectonic deformation in the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, which began almost synchronously with the India-Eurasia plate collision.",

                    "Answer": "The goal of collecting and analyzing thermochronological data, such as apatite fission track dating, is to provide temporal constraints on tectonic exhumation processes in the northern Tibetan Plateau. This data is crucial for understanding the uplift history of the plateau and the interactions between tectonics, climate, and erosion. By analyzing the cooling ages of rock samples, researchers aim to reconstruct the exhumation history of the region, which can offer insights into the timing and dynamics of geological processes that have shaped the terrain, such as the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates.",
