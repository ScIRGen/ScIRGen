(2019), and the specific calculation method is shown in the article. The source data range is global, and  Tibetan plateau region is selected in this data set. This data integrates the original semi monthly scale data into the monthly data, and the processing method is to take the maximum value of two periods of Lai in a month, so as to achieve the effect of removing noise as much as possible. This data set is one of the most widely used Lai data, and is often used to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of vegetation greenness, which has practical significance and theoretical value.",

Data from satellites, available since the early 1980s, indicate increasing greenness over the Earth’s lands, from Svalbard to Australia and from Alaska to Chukotka. The previously inferred dominant role of a CO2 fertilization effect, and of indirect drivers in general, in the greening of the Earth raises the question of the role of human land use in shaping the vegetation greenness patterns on global lands. Now that better quality leaf area data are available from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor observations, we aim here to assess the role of the direct driver, that is, human land-use management, without recourse to models, by characterizing the greening patterns in ecosystems globally."

The effects of higher CO2 concentrations on plant growth, outside of experimental situations, are poorly understood and—as a consequence—the models differ widely in their prognostications. Deleterious effects of the loss of sensor calibration, orbital drift of satellites, atmospheric contamination of vegetation signals and disjointed stitching of data from multiple sequential sensors were evident in the underlying satellite data that were used in nearly all previous studies."

However, recent satellite data (2000–2017) reveal a greening pattern that is strikingly prominent in China and India and overlaps with croplands world-wide. We compare the above results to those from AVHRR data, which we have recently updated using the same method described previously, for completeness. AVHRR data from the comparable period (2000–2016) show less greening (22% of vegetated lands) and more browning (14%)."

The observed large-scale greening of China and India is a harbinger of food self-sufficiency for 2.7 billion people in the two top ranked countries in terms of agricultural output."
