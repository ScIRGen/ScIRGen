            "description": "The Tibetan Plateau has an average altitude of over 4000 m and is the region with the highest altitude and the largest snow cover in the middle and low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere regions. Snow cover is the most important underlying surface of the seasonal changes on the Tibetan Plateau and an important composing element of ecological environment. Ice and snow melt water is an important water resource of the plateau and its downstream areas. At the same time, plateau snow, as an important land-surface forcing factor, is closely related to disastrous weather (such as droughts and floods) in East Asia, the South Asian monsoon and in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It is an important indicator of short-term climate prediction and one of the most sensitive responses to global climate change. The snow depth refers to the vertical depth from the surface of the snow to the ground. It is an important parameter for snow characteristics and one of the conventional meteorological observation elements. It is the key parameter of snow water equivalent estimation, climate effect studies of snow cover, the basin water balance, the simulation and monitoring of snow-melt, and snow disaster evaluation and grading.\nIn this data set, the Tibetan Plateau boundary was determined by adopting the natural topography as the leading factor and by comprehensive consideration of the principles of altitude, plateau and mountain integrity. The main part of the plateau is in the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province, with an area of 2.572 million square kilometers, accounting for 26.8% of the total land area of China. The snow depth observation data are the monthly maximum snow depth data after quality detection and quality control. There are 102 meteorological stations in the study area, most of which were built during the 1950s to 1970s. The data for some months or years for sites existing during this period were missing, and the complete observational records from 1961 to 2013 were adopted. The temporal resolution is daily, the spatial coverage is the Tibetan Plateau, and all the data were quality controlled. Accurate and detailed plateau snow depth data are of great significance for the diagnosis of climate change, the evolution of the Asian monsoon and the management of regional snow-melt water resources.",

                "Snow, as an important component of the Earth's land surface and a primary form of the cryosphere, is a significant water resource in many parts of the world and is closely related to people's daily lives. Additionally, the high reflectivity and low thermal conductivity of snow, along with its ability to absorb a large amount of heat during melting, contribute to hydrological effects that increase soil moisture and lower temperatures. This process alters the surface radiation balance and atmospheric thermal conditions, leading to changes in atmospheric circulation and consequently impacting regional climate. The Tibetan Plateau, with an average elevation of over 4,000 meters, is the highest and most snow-covered region in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Snow not only represents the most significant seasonal variation in the underlying surface of the Tibetan Plateau but is also an important component of its ecological environment. Meltwater from snow and ice is a crucial water resource for the plateau and its downstream areas. Furthermore, the high altitude and large area of the Tibetan Plateau, located in the mid-latitudes, make its snow cover significantly influential on climate change at both global and regional scales. Snow depth, defined as the vertical distance from the snow surface to the ground, is an important parameter that characterizes snow features and is one of the conventional meteorological observation elements. It is essential for estimating snow water equivalent, studying snow climate effects, assessing watershed water balance, simulating snowmelt runoff, and monitoring and evaluating the occurrence and classification of snow disasters. Currently, snow depth observations are mainly conducted through ground measurements and satellite remote sensing."

In this study, there are a total of 105 meteorological stations, most of which were established in the 1950s to 1970s. Some stations have missing data for certain months or years during this period, a few were newly established after the 1980s, and some ceased operation after the 1980s.

In 1997, the snow depth on the plateau experienced a significant climate shift from an increasing to a decreasing trend. Spring is the season with the highest average snow depth on the plateau, and over the past 30 years, the average maximum snow depth in spring has experienced a very significant declining trend, with an average decrease of 0.47 cm every 10 years, and a climate shift from high to low occurred in 1998. The distribution of snow on the plateau in summer is extremely limited, and from 1981 to 2010, there was also a significant decreasing trend in the average maximum snow depth in summer, with a reduction rate of 0.1 cm·(10a)^-1. The trend of average maximum snow depth in autumn on the plateau is not obvious; however, the trends of snow depth vary in different regions, with 56% of the stations showing varying degrees of decreasing trends, while 31% of the stations show varying degrees of increasing trends. In winter, the average maximum snow depth on the plateau shows a slight decreasing trend, but it is not significant."
