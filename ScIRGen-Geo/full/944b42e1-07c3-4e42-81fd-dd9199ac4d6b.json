            "description": "The dataset is the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) products from 1980s to 2019 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the NDMI equation which use the difference ratio between the NIR band and SWIR2 band to quantitatively reflect the water content of vegetation canopy .And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.NDMI is highly correlated with canopy water content and can be used to estimate vegetation water content, and it is also used to analyze the change of land surface temperature because it is strongly correlated with land surface temperature.",
            "descriptionCn": "1）数据内容：本数据集包含从1980s-2019年青藏高原地区Landsat长时序NDMI产品。2）数据来源及加工方法：主要是在青藏高原Landsat系列卫星地表反射率数据集的基础上，通过NDMI的计算公式进行生产的，即利用近红外与短波红外之间的差异来定量化反映植被冠层的水分含量情况；3）数据质量描述：为了标识云、冰雪，并相应生产了质量标识文件（QA）。4) 数据应用成果及前景：NDMI与冠层水分含量高度相关，可以用来估计植被水分含量，而且NDMI与地表温度之间存在较强的相关性，因此也常用于分析地表温度的变化情况。",

Recent studies show that Himalayan glaciers have experienced rapid thinning and shrinkage and that the rates of observed mass changes are spatially and temporally variable. The drivers for the spatiotemporal variability are not well understood and a variety of factors have been proposed to explain it, including debris cover, glacier-lake interactions, morphological variables, climate variability (patterns in air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation) and the response of individual glaciers to climate variability."

Two automatic weather stations (AWSs) were installed on a lateral moraine beside Naimona'nyi Glacier. AWS1, at 5,543 m a.s.l., recorded meteorological variables from October 2011 at half hourly resolution, including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and downward shortwave radiation (Sin). AWS2 was installed at 5,950 m a.s.l. in October 2010 and recorded Ta, RH, Sin, WS, and WD at hourly resolution. Precipitation data was obtained from all-weather precipitation gauges (T-200B) equipped with hanging weighing transducers installed close to AWS2 in September 2013. Two air temperature and humidity sensors (T1 and T2) were installed on Naimona'nyi Glacier in October 2018 at 6,075 and 5,984 m a.s.l., respectively, to measure gradients in air temperature and relative humidity."

Simulations showed that melt during the ablation season dominated the annual mass balance and the interannual variability in the mass balance, and that variability in melt energy was controlled by albedo during the ablation season. The annual mass balance was found to be significantly correlated with annual precipitation during the 2011–2018 period, which is accounted for by the change in ablation-season albedo and melt energy. The average mass balance for glaciers in the western Himalayas were higher during the 2010–2019 period than during the 2000–2009 period, partly because of higher annual precipitation during the 2010–2019 period. Over the last 20 years, the increased precipitation in the cold season was driven by a cyclonic circulation anomaly over the northwestern Indian Peninsula, which may be linked to the strengthened North Atlantic Oscillation, and the increased precipitation in the ablation season was driven by an anomaly in the cyclonic circulation over Central India, which may be related to enhanced deep convection over the Indian subcontinent and the enhanced Atlantic multidecadal oscillation."
