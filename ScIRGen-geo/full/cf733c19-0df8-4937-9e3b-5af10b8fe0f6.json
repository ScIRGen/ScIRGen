Quantifying the rise of the Himalaya origin and implications for the South Asian monsoon. Geography, 45:215-218. This achievement is part of a series of research results of paleoaltitude carried out by Ding Lin' team. We reconstruct the rise of a segment of the southern flank of the Himalaya-Tibet orogen, to the south of the Lhasa terrane, using a paleoaltimeter based on paleoenthalpy encoded in fossil leaves from two new assemblages in southern Tibet (Liuqu and Qiabulin) and four previously known floras from the Himalaya foreland basin. U-Pb dating of zircons constrains the Liuqu flora to the latest Paleocene (ca. 56 Ma) and the Qiabulin flora to the earliest Miocene (21–19 Ma). The proto-Himalaya grew slowly against a high (~4 km) proto–Tibetan Plateau from ~1 km in the late Paleocene to ~2.3 km at the beginning of the Miocene, and achieved at least ~5.5 km by ca. 15 Ma. Contrasting precipitation patterns between the Himalaya-Tibet edifice and the Himalaya foreland basin for the past ~56 m.y. show  progressive drying across southern Tibet, seemingly linked to the uplift of the Himalaya orogen.",

                "Quantifying the rise of the Himalaya since the onset of the collision of India with Asia at ca. 55 ± 10 Ma (Wang et al., 2014) has proved challenging and controversial (Garzione et al., 2000; Spicer et al., 2003; Currie et al., 2005; Rowley and Currie, 2006; DeCelles et al., 2007; Saylor et al., 2009; Ding et al., 2014), spurred on by the idea that changes in surface height, area, and surface characteristics of the Himalaya orogen and Tibetan Plateau underpin South Asian and East Asian monsoon dynamics (Molnar et al., 1993; Boos and Kuang, 2010). Opinions differ on how the plateau evolved, but modeling suggests that an orographic high such as the Himalaya may be more important than the elevation and/or extent of the entire plateau in shaping modern South Asian monsoon circulation (Boos and Kuang, 2010). Understanding the coupling between tectonics and climate requires quantification of elevation history, but to date little is known about the rise of the proto-Himalaya, with almost all the paleoaltimetry of different parts of the Himalayan chain only showing that it was near its present elevation by the late Miocene (Garzione et al., 2000; Saylor et al., 2009; Gébelin et al., 2013). In woody dicot angiosperms, evolutionary selection has resulted in a genome capable of producing highly variable leaf architecture optimized to local climate, and globally leaf form is more strongly linked to climate than taxonomic affinity (Yang et al., 2015). Unsurprisingly then, leaf form encodes the numerous climate metrics characteristic of monsoons (Spicer et al., 2016) as well as moist enthalpy, an expression of both atmospheric temperature and moisture that varies with elevation (Forest et al., 1999)."

This approach has uncovered that regions like the proto-Himalaya grew from ~1 km in the late Paleocene to ~2.3 km by the early Miocene, eventually reaching ~5.5 km by around 15 Ma. This data helps in understanding the tectonic evolution and its impact on climatic patterns over millions of years.",
