            "description": "The change in carbon stocks in tropical regions plays a crucial role in the global carbon balance. However, current observation methods are not yet capable of accurately and extensively monitoring the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of carbon stocks in tropical areas. This dataset is based on passive microwave observations in the low-frequency L-band (L-VOD) to calculate and quantify annual-scale changes in aboveground biomass carbon flux. The results indicate that during the period of 2014-2020, carbon stocks in tropical regions exhibited a carbon sink, with a net increase of 0.17 PgC/year. The carbon losses caused by the 2015/2016 El Niño event have been fully recovered by 2020, with non-forest woody plants playing a dominant role in the carbon recovery process in tropics, compensating for carbon losses caused by the El Niño event, deforestation, and forest degradation.",
