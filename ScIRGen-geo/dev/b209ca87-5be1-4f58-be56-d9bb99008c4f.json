            "description": "This data is the result of radioactivity intensity measurement in Mika area of Nigeria. Granite and granite porphyry are exposed on the surface of Mika area. Through the layout of survey lines, the radioactive intensity of the surface is measured, and the radioactive intensity of different sections can be obtained. In addition, according to the high-density wiring, the regional radioactive intensity map can be obtained. Gamma scout radiation counters is used to measure the radioactivity in the area. The above data have been published in high-level international SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. This study, through the exploration of this area, obtained the relevant radioactive data of the target area in Mika area of Nigeria, which provides important instructions for the later prospecting prospect and future prospecting work.",

These prospects are restricted to northeastern Nigeria and were all discovered by Nigeria Uranium Mining Company (NUMCO). Prior to their discovery, efforts in uranium exploration in Nigeria were concentrated towards the Younger Granite Province in the North Central Nigeria.
