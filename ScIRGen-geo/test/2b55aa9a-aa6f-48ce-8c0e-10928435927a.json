These tools allow for detailed ground-truthing, which can enhance the calibration and validation of remote sensing data collected by airborne microwave radiometers. However, the accuracy may be influenced by the uniformity of measurements across large areas and potential human error in instrument handling. The spatial distribution of sampling points (9 points per transect) ensures a comprehensive coverage, which can improve the overall reliability of the dataset.",

This method allows for the validation and calibration of remote sensing data, ensuring that the airborne measurements are reliable and can be correlated with ground-truth data.
