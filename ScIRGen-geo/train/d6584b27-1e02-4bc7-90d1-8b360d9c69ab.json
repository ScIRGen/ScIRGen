The observation started on 24 July, 2014 and finished on 1 August, 2014.\n1.\tObservation time\nOn days of 24 July, 27 July, 30 July, 31 July and 1 August, 2014\n2.\tSamples and observation methods\nLarge areas with homogeneous vegetation (greater than 100 m * 100 m) were chosen as the observation samples. And forty field samples were selected according to the characteristics of vegetation distribution in the downstream. The land-use types including the cantaloupe, the Tamarix chinensis, the reeds, the weeds, the Karelinia caspica, the Sophora alopecuroides and so on.\nLAI data were calculated according to the transmittance derived from an A value (above-canopy readings) and four B values (below readings). More than two LAI values were obtained for each sample. At the same time, the heights of the vegetation in each sample were measured.\n3.\tObservation instrument\nLAI 2200\n4.\tData storage\nThe observation recorded data were stored in excel and the original LAI data were stored in txt files.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of ecological hydrology remote sensing experiments, 'LAI 2200 observation' refers to the use of the LAI 2200 instrument for measuring the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of vegetation. This involves observing the canopy structure by measuring both the incoming and transmitted light through the canopy, which allows researchers to infer the LAI using a gap fraction model. This method was used to collect data across various plant species in a defined area during specific observation periods.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of specific vegetation types for canopy LAI observations is influenced by the distribution characteristics of the vegetation in the area. Large and uniform vegetation areas, greater than 100 m x 100 m, are selected to ensure consistent and reliable data collection. In the context of the ecological remote sensing experiment in the Heihe River basin, 40 observation plots were chosen, considering the typical vegetation cover such as muskmelon, tamarisk, reed, weeds, Haloxylon, and Sophora alopecuroides, to gather comprehensive data on diverse vegetation types.",

This data collection aims to understand the vegetation characteristics and their ecological dynamics using the LAI 2200 instrument, facilitating accurate modeling of canopy structures and enhancing ecological and hydrological studies in the region.",

The average of these measurements is used to derive the canopy LAI using a gap fraction model. Each plot is measured at least twice, and vegetation height is also recorded. The observations are documented using Excel for observational data and TXT for raw LAI data.",
