It is considered one of the most effective tools for determining single plant water use, providing data on daily, monthly, and seasonal changes in transpiration at the individual plant scale. In the context of the research, a 蒸渗仪 system was established in the lower reaches of the Heihe River to measure saplings, with an observation frequency of every 0.5 hours, focusing on changes in water content, infiltration, and evapotranspiration.",

This method can reveal how water availability, soil moisture, and plant physiological responses fluctuate with seasons, particularly in the arid regions of the lower Heihe River where water resources are limited.",

                    "Answer": "Lysimeters, being highly effective tools for measuring plant water usage, can face challenges in arid regions like the Heihe River Basin due to the variability in soil moisture, infiltration rates, and evapotranspiration. The frequent data collection every 0.5 hours helps in capturing detailed changes in water content, which can mitigate some of these challenges by providing comprehensive datasets on diurnal and seasonal variations.",

This allows for a nuanced understanding of plant responses to environmental conditions, which can improve water management strategies and enhance ecological modeling in the region.",
