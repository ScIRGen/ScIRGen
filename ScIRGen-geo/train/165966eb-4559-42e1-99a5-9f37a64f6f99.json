            "description": "The Huanghuang Valley was one of the most important agricultural development areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, especially by the Qing Dynasty, the land cover of the area underwent significant changes. By collating and correcting the 1500、1600cropland data recorded in the historical documents of the area, with a view to revealing the basic conditions of arable land changes and human activities in the typical river valley agricultural area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we provide a theoretical basis. This data contains raster data on the spatial distribution pattern of arable land in the Huanghuang Valley in 1500、1600 with a spatial resolution of 1km*1km.The data of cultivated land in Hehuang Valley in 1500 and 1600 mainly come from the Records of Xining, New Records of Xining Prefecture, Shaanxi Tongzhi and Record of Ming Shenzong.  The determination of county administrative boundaries refers to Atlas of Chinese History edited by Tan Qixiang and Comprehensive Table of Administrative Region Evolution in Qing Dynasty edited by Niu Hanping. The original data on cropland collected from the historical literature was corrected and then the quantitative data was assigned to space using a grid drawing method.",

In particular, the links between natural environment changes and social development manifests more significantly in agro-pastoral transition zones where human livelihoods rely heavily on environmental conditions. China has a large area of agro-pastoral transition zones that forms an agro-pastoral belt across its North and West. It is a transitional belt that divides not only agriculture areas and pastoral areas but also the humid climate areas and arid climate areas in China. Therefore, the agro-pastoral belt and zones are sensitive and of high significance on climate change impacts."

This conversion allows for a consistent comparison across different time periods and aids in visualizing long-term trends and spatial patterns in agro-pastoral transition zones.

                    "Answer": "To convert historical cropland data into a modern spatial distribution format, the procedure begins with the collection of raw historical data, such as those from documents like 'Xining Fu Zhi' and others. These raw data, which are recorded in historical units, need to be calibrated and converted into modern units like square kilometers. Next, a grid model is applied to spatialize the calibrated data, assigning cropland data to a 1km×1km grid format. This involves using historical texts, historical maps, and modern GIS techniques to ensure accurate spatial representation.",

                    "Answer": "Natural disasters and socio-economic factors are integrated into the analysis by collecting historical records of such events from sources like 'History of Disasters in Northwest China.' These factors are then compared against fluctuations in cropland data to identify correlations or impacts. For instance, a decrease in cropland discovered in the middle of the 19th century was cross-referenced with records of frequent natural disasters and a cooling climate trend, demonstrating the influence of external factors on cropland changes.",
