            "description": "Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important indicator for measuring ecosystem productivity. This dataset provides the forest aboveground biomass with a resolution of 30m in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2022. The biomass data is estimated using Landsat series data, based on actual ground data and some literature data, vegetation indexes, topographic data and climate data. Through data disclosure and free download services, it provides basic data support for related research on the dynamic changes of forest ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and also provides a scientific basis for sustainable forest management in this region. The coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE of the estimated AGB at pixel level were 0.54 and 49.00t/ha, respectively.",
