The whole-rock major element data are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, the trace element data are obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the Sr and Nd isotope data are obtained by multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the major element chemical data of minerals are obtained by electron probe microanalyzer, Zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data were obtained by laser ablation combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and zircon O isotopic data were analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. These data were used for further explore the petrogenesis of these granites and hosed enclaves.",
