            "description": "The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) has been widely used in meteorological drought monitoring. Non stationarity was not considered in drought monitoring based on SPEI. Here, we propose an improved SPEI (NSPEI) that takes into account the non-stationary nature of hydrological and meteorological processes. 1) Based on monthly meteorological data from 2266 meteorological stations in China, the inverse distance weighting method was used to interpolate to 0.1 ° and calculate NSPEI. The dataset covers the period from January 1, 1970 to December 31, 2022. 2) Based on ERA5 precipitation and temperature data, the NSPEI grid is calculated, covering the period from January 1, 1970 to December 31, 2020, with a spatial resolution of 0.25 °. 3) Using 23 CMIP6 models to output data, covering the period from 2015 to 2100, a multimodal ensemble averaging was conducted, considering four shared socio-economic paths (SSPs) scenarios: low social vulnerability at low emission levels (SSP126), medium social vulnerability at medium emission ranges (SSP245), relatively high social vulnerability at medium high forcing ranges (SSP370), and high emissions with high mitigation but low adaptation challenges (SSP585). The dataset can serve as a non-stationary drought monitoring indicator for historical and future periods at the site and grid scales.",
            "instructions": "File Name: 1) The drought index data interpolated by the site is stored in TIF format. The file name is \"NSPEI3_197001. shp. tif\", where 3 represents the time scale and 1970 represents the CSV file describing the NSPEI drought index for January 1970. 2) The ERA5 grid drought index data is stored in nc format, with the file name \"NSPEI3-ERA5_198001-202012. nc\". For example, NSPEI3-ERA5_198001-202012. nc represents the monthly NSPEI drought index of the 0.25 ° grid in China from 1980 to 2020, which is described in this nc file. 3) The grid drought index data of CMIP6 is stored in nc format, with the file name \"NSPEI3-MME_ssp126_201501-205012. nc\". For example, NSPEI3 represents the NSPEI drought index of three scales in this nc file, and ssp126 represents the NSPEI drought index calculated under the SSP126 scenario. Data reading method: The station interpolation data tif files and nc data files in this dataset can be opened using software such as ArcGIS or Matlab for graphical display.",

In contrast, satellite-derived data like ERA5 is used to calculate gridded NSPEI with a spatial resolution of 0.25°. The station-based interpolation approach may provide higher accuracy in regions with dense station networks due to localized data, while satellite data offers consistent coverage but may have lower spatial resolution and accuracy depending on the satellite's sensing capabilities and data processing algorithms.",

These challenges include integrating data from 2266 meteorological stations across China, using interpolation methods like inverse distance weighting for spatial resolution, and dealing with the complexity of different climate models and scenarios from the CMIP6 outputs. Additionally, factors like the spatial resolution of gridded data and the inclusion of various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios also contribute to this complexity.",
