            "titleEn": "Typical village UAV aerial photography dataset in Hehuang Valley, Qinghai (2022)",
            "description": "This dataset was collected by a research team during a field investigation in the Hehuang Valley of Qinghai Province from July to August 2022. Using the DJI Mavic2pro equipped with a Hasselblad L1D-20c camera, 55 typical villages were selected in the Hehuang Valley and over 4600 aerial photographs were obtained using drone photogrammetry technology as raw data. Using AgisfphotoScan 1.25 software to synthesize orthophoto images with a spatial resolution of 0.05m. The vector data of human settlement boundaries in villages was extracted through visual interpretation. Based on the object-oriented human-machine interaction interpretation method, 55 typical village land use datasets in 2022 were obtained (including forests, grasslands, forest land, cultivated land, water bodies, roads, unused land, and building land, totaling 8 categories). By establishing 1050 sample points and using confusion matrix analysis, it was found that the overall accuracy of the dataset was 96.86%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.95. It can accurately reflect the spatial form, land use composition, and surrounding environment of typical villages. Aerial photographs all have longitude, latitude, and altitude information, providing ultra-high resolution data sources for village spatial structure analysis, land use mapping, and analysis work, effectively assisting in the improvement of human housing and rural revitalization strategies.",
            "instructions": "File Naming:\nThe \"P1Original image\" folder stores the original image data captured by drones. The original drone images of each village are stored in folders named with \"yyyydddname,\" where yyyy represents the year, ddd represents the specific date, and name represents the specific name of the village and its administrative region. For example, \"2022.7.22 Daxing District Zizhuang Town Shangcheng Village\" represents the original drone image obtained on July 22, 2022, in Shangcheng Village, Zizhuang Town, Daxing District.\n\nThe \"P2Digital image\" folder stores the village drone remote sensing images stitched through Agisoft PhotoScan 1.25. The data for each village is stored in folders named with \"yyyydddname,\" where yyyy represents the year, ddd represents the specific date, and name represents the specific name of the village and its administrative region. For example, \"2022.7.22 Daxing District Zizhuang Town Shangcheng Village\" represents the stitched drone image obtained on July 22, 2022, in Shangcheng Village, Zizhuang Town, Daxing District. Each village folder contains Agisoft PhotoScan project files in psxg format, a PDF report of the stitching, and orthophoto images and DSM images in TIF format.\n\nThe \"P3Classification result\" folder stores the land use classification results of each village obtained using object-oriented human-computer interaction interpretation methods. \"Villages boundary\" contains all village boundary data, while \"Classification result\" represents the final land use classification results of all villages.\n\nThe \"Village information.xlsx\" specifically displays the names, English abbreviations, and geographical regions of each village.\n\nData Reading Method:\nAll JPG files in this dataset can be directly opened with photo software such as Photos. The main content is stored in TIF and SHP formats and can be opened using ArcMap.",
