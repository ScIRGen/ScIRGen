            "titleEn": "Mitochondrial genome data of ancient DNA from hanging coffins in East Asia",
            "description": "The complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of 41 human remains from 13 hanging coffin sites 2500-660 years ago in Weixin and Yanjin, Zhaotong, Yunnan, Huacun, Baise, Guangxi and bangmapa, Thailand were analyzed by using the ancient DNA analysis technique. They found that the maternal genetic diversity of the hanging coffin people in Northwest Yunnan was very high, while the genetic diversity of the hanging coffin people in northern Thailand was relatively low. This result is consistent with the view that the hanging coffin burial custom originated in southern China and spread southward to Southeast Asia. In addition, a small number of matrilineal lineages were shared among the hanging coffin people in different regions of Asia, indicating that there is a very close relationship between different hanging coffin people. Combining the results of genetic analysis with the evidences of archaeology, physical anthropology, folklore and history, they speculated that the hanging coffin burial custom originated in the Baiyue ethnic group in the southeast coastal areas of China (such as Wuyishan area) about 3600 years ago, and they are the ancestors of the Dai ethnic group with many ethnic groups. After that, the custom of hanging coffin was widely spread in South China by means of people migration and flow. However, about 2000 years ago (the earliest time of hanging coffin burial in Thailand), a very small number of inheritors of hanging coffin burial spread the custom to some aboriginal groups in Southeast Asia, such as northern Thailand, by means of cultural diffusion.\nThis study only makes a preliminary discussion from the perspective of maternal genetic lineage. For the hanging coffin culture which has spread for more than 3000 years in South China, Southeast Asia and the vast area of the Pacific Islands, the origin and development of its culture and the history of its inheritors may be more complex. In the future, more representative samples of human remains buried in a hanging coffin will be used, from the perspective of genomic DNA and paternal Y-DNA, combined with interdisciplinary research, which will provide more systematic evidence support for a more comprehensive display of the historical and cultural features of the hanging coffin burial custom.",

                    "Answer": "The genetic diversity of the悬棺葬 populations, as analyzed through ancient DNA (aDNA) techniques, is notably higher in the populations from Northwestern Yunnan, while it is relatively lower in the悬棺葬 populations of Northern Thailand. This suggests a trend of悬棺葬 practices originating in Southern China and migrating southward into Southeast Asia.",

                    "Answer": "The observed high genetic diversity in the mitochondrial genomes of ancient suspended coffin burial populations in northwest Yunnan suggests a complex pattern of human migration and cultural diffusion originating from the southeastern coastal regions of China. This diversity supports the hypothesis that the suspended coffin burial practice spread through demic diffusion among migrating populations. In contrast, the lower genetic diversity observed in northern Thailand indicates that the practice may have later spread to this region through cultural assimilation, with only a small number of people carrying the tradition to local indigenous groups. The genetic evidence aligns with archaeological and historical data, pointing to a migration and cultural transmission process over several millennia.",

                    "Answer": "The variation in genetic diversity among悬棺葬 populations in different regions of East Asia and Southeast Asia is primarily due to the historical migration and cultural diffusion patterns. The high maternal genetic diversity observed in the滇西北悬棺葬 populations suggests a long history of population movement and interaction in this area, likely originating from the百越族群 of the中国东南沿海地区. In contrast, the relatively low genetic diversity in the悬棺葬 populations of泰国北部 may be attributed to a smaller number of cultural transmitters who spread the悬棺葬 customs to Southeast Asia through cultural assimilation.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to investigate the maternal genetic lineages and diversity among populations practicing hanging coffin burials, which can provide insights into the origins, migration patterns, and cultural diffusion of this burial practice from southern China to Southeast Asia. This involves understanding the genetic relationships and cultural connections between different regions and time periods, potentially tracing back to the ancestral Daic-speaking populations in the coastal regions of southeastern China.",

A significant challenge is ensuring the preservation and quality of the DNA, which requires careful handling of the samples to avoid contamination. Additionally, the process involves selecting representative samples from various sites, such as those in Yunnan, Guangxi, and northern Thailand, while overcoming the potential degradation of genetic material due to environmental factors. Techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are typically employed to analyze the full mitochondrial DNA sequences, providing insights into the genetic diversity and historical migration patterns of the悬棺葬 populations.",

                    "Answer": "The cultural practices of悬棺葬 are complex and have spread over vast regions including South China, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands over the past three thousand years. The existing dataset focuses primarily on maternal genetic lineages, which only provide a preliminary exploration of悬棺葬 cultural practices. Comprehensive representation may require a more extensive sampling of悬棺葬 human remains, incorporating genomic DNA and paternal Y-DNA lineages, and integrating evidence from multiple disciplines such as archaeology, physical anthropology, folklore, and history.",
