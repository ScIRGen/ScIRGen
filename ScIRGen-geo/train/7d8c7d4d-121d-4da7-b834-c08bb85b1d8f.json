                "With the increase in global average temperature, the intensity and frequency of extreme temperatures are also changing. Many studies have indicated that the observed changes in extreme temperature are significant, and the influence of human activities is an important factor. Extreme temperatures have many direct and indirect influences on numerous aspects of society and the economy, such as agricultural production, economic development, infrastructure, the ecological environment and public health. However, extreme temperatures show different magnitudes of response to global warming in different regions; and for some regions, extreme temperatures feature larger change and inter-model spread than the global mean temperature. More than two-thirds of the world's population lives in the region of Eurasia, which is composed of more than 90 countries, most of which are developing countries, but there are also many highly developed or densely populated areas. Climate models have for some time been utilized as the primary tool for projecting future changes in climate extremes. As the primary activity within the latest phase (Phase 6) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) provides a set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios with different future emissions, land-use changes, and so on. Evaluating the capacity of climate models participating in CMIP6 to simulate extreme temperatures can ensure the reliability of the simulations to a certain extent."

Therefore, in this context, the present study focuses on the possible future changes of extreme temperature in Eurasia. We then estimate the avoided change in extreme temperature indices at the lower warming level compared with the higher warming level at the local scale in Eurasia."

For example, the observed DTR index is outside the range of the model simulations (Figure 2e); in the most recent 20 years (1995–2014), there is a larger uncertainty in the WSDI index, resulting from the wider inter-model spread than that in the previous 40 years (Figure 2o); the increases of WSDI in the multi-model ensemble mean and median are larger than in the observation (Figure 2o); and the CMIP6 models fail to capture the observed anomalies in years with large amplitude. Some models have large centred pattern root-mean-square differences and small spatial correlation coefficients, and thus cannot simulate the corresponding spatial pattern well. Therefore, the simulations of DTR index have poor reliability."

The R language package ‘climdex.pcic’ was used in the calculation of the HadEX3 data (Dunnet al., 2020). As a companion library for ‘climdex.pcic’, ‘climdex.pcic.ncdf’, which helps in utilizing the NetCDF format data, were also used in this study, to ensure consistency when comparing CMIP6-based indices with HadEX3 indices. The 16 extreme temperature indices (hereinafter referred to simply as‘indices’) of the 24 CMIP6 models were calculated on the original model grids. Since the 24 CMIP6 models differ in their spatial resolution, all model-simulated indices were uniformly interpolated onto a grid with the same resolution as the HadEX3 data (1.875/C14 × 1.25/C14 ) with a bilinear interpolation scheme, to facilitate the analysis and model evaluation. To ensure statistical comparability between the model simulations and HadEX3 observations, we assess the performance of models only at those grid locations where observations are available, that is, we masked the interpolated indices of the historical experiment with the temporal and spatial availability of the corresponding indices in the HadEX3 data prior to evaluation. In addition, to eliminate interference from missing values on the accuracy of the evaluation, those grids where missing time steps amounted to more than 10% of the total were removed from both the historical simulation and HadEX3 data when carrying out the evaluation. We first compare the temporal evolution of the indices averaged over Eurasia between the CMIP6 model simulations and the HadEX3 observations to see whether the regional averaged temporal evolutions can be reproduced. We then assess the performance of the CMIP6 models in simulating the spatial patterns of extreme temperature indices, applying two metrics: the Taylor diagram and the Portrait diagram."

Some models have large centered pattern root-mean-square differences and small spatial correlation coefficients, which affect their capability to simulate spatial patterns accurately.",

                    "Answer": "The uncertainty in the observed and simulated indices of extreme temperatures in recent decades is caused by the wider inter-model spread and the models' failure to capture observed anomalies in years with large amplitude. Additionally, inconsistencies between observed data and model simulations, such as the observed DTR index being outside the range of model simulations, contribute to this uncertainty.",

The indices are calculated on the original model grids and then interpolated onto a uniform grid resolution to facilitate analysis. This allows for the comparison of temporal evolution and spatial patterns of extreme temperature indices between model simulations and observations.",

The integration process involves calculating extreme temperature indices for model data, interpolating them to a uniform grid resolution, and then comparing them with observational indices. This comparison helps in projecting future changes under scenarios like SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, ensuring the reliability of projections by evaluating the models' performance in simulating historical data.",

This inconsistency is partly because some models have large centred pattern root-mean-square differences and small spatial correlation coefficients, hindering their ability to accurately simulate corresponding spatial patterns.",

Despite challenges, the models are anticipated to project general increases in indices such as TXn, TNn, SU, and TR, with a decrease in FD, due to global warming. The spatial patterns of regional responses are also expected to be similar across different levels of global warming, although their magnitudes of change may differ significantly.",

Additionally, the spatial patterns of extreme temperature indices are assessed using metrics like the Taylor diagram and the Portrait diagram. The evaluations are conducted by comparing model simulations at grid locations where observational data is available.",

Some models exhibit large root-mean-square differences and low spatial correlation coefficients, leading to poor simulation of spatial patterns. These inconsistencies affect the reliability of the simulations and consequently the projections of future changes in extreme temperature indices.",

This requires masking the interpolated indices of the historical experiment with the temporal and spatial availability of the corresponding indices in the HadEX3 data prior to evaluation. Additionally, to eliminate interference from missing values on evaluation accuracy, grids with missing time steps amounting to more than 10% of the total are removed from both the historical simulation and HadEX3 data.",
