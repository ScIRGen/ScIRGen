            "description": "This data set mainly includes Cu isotopic analysis of orogenic peridotites from the everea Alps, Italy, in balmucha and baltisa. Zn isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation. The whole rock sample was crushed to less than 200 mesh without pollution, and the powder was digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin. Then the zinc isotope was tested by MC-ICPMS. The international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. These peridotite Zn isotopic data provide important information for mantle reservoir Zn isotopic composition.",

                    "Answer": "'Zn同位素分析' refers to the process of analyzing zinc isotopes in orogenic peridotites from the Italian Alps, specifically in areas like Balmuccia and Baldissero. This involves preparing whole-rock samples by crushing them to a fine powder, digesting them with acid, and separating them using ion exchange resins. The zinc isotopes are then tested using MC-ICPMS (Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry), with international standard samples used to monitor the data quality. This analysis provides crucial information about the zinc isotope composition of mantle reservoirs.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in collecting Zn isotope data from orogenic peridotites in the Italian Alps may arise from the need to ensure that whole rock samples are uncontaminated and finely crushed to below 200 mesh. Additionally, the process of acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation must be meticulously carried out to prepare the sample for accurate measurement using MC-ICPMS. Furthermore, maintaining precision and accuracy during testing involves using internationally recognized standard samples to monitor the data quality, which can be a complex and demanding aspect of the data collection process.",
