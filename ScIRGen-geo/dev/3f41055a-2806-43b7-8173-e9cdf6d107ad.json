            "description": "There are many lakes in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The glacial phenology and duration of lakes in this region are very sensitive to regional and global climate change, so they are used as the key indicators of climate change research, especially the comparative study of the three polar environmental changes of the earth. However, due to its poor natural environment and sparse population, there is a lack of conventional field measurement of lake ice phenology. The lake ice was monitored with a resolution of 500 meters by using the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) data of MODIS. The traditional snow map algorithm is used to detect the lake daily ice amount and coverage under the condition of sunny days, and the lake daily ice amount and coverage under the condition of cloud cover are re determined through a series of steps based on the spatiotemporal continuity of the lake surface conditions. Through time series analysis, 308 lakes larger than 3km2 are identified as effective records of lake ice range and coverage, forming a daily lake ice range and coverage data set, including 216 lakes.",
            "instructions": "The dataset contains 5834 grid files and one vector file. The grid is the daily lake ice range. The vector file contains the number, name, location, surface area and classification number of the lake to be processed. Users can first use vector files to determine the number, location and classification of a given lake, and then get the corresponding daily ice cover data.",

Lake ice is an indicator of changes in lake environments; moreover, it is also one of the key Environmental Climate Variables (ECVs) in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). However, the existing in situ lake ice observation data for the Tibetan Plateau is severely limited due to the remoteness, harsh eco-environmental conditions, and thin atmosphere in this region. At present, many researchers have studied the lake ice phenology based on remote sensing data and released four data sets, but the dataset derived primarily from coarse resolution passive microwave observations is not effective for monitoring the numerous small lakes in the Tibetan Plateau."

Based on the complementary morning and afternoon satellite observations, daily lake ice/water data under cloud cover conditions was synthesized based on the following three rules. The cloud-covered pixels were re-identified using spatial adjacent relationships and its spatial continuity based on their proximity. Aiming to obtain the inventory of lake ice/water change characteristics for every single lake, a further time series filter was conducted for each lake with ice, water, and cloud."
