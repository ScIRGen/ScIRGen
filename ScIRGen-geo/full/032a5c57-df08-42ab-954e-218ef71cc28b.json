            "description": "In 2000, the population grid data of Heihe River Basin was generated based on 1:100000 land use data and population statistics data of each county in 2000.\nUsing principal component analysis and factor analysis, four factors are extracted from 11 regionalization indexes, and the Heihe River Basin is divided into four population distribution characteristic regions by using factor scores for hierarchical clustering. The linear regression model between rural residential land, cultivated land area and rural population is established based on the population statistical data of each county in 2000. The total population of each district and county is controlled. The population coefficient is adjusted according to the principle of different population distribution characteristics. The cultivated land population distribution coefficient is modified in the middle green continent, and the grassland population distribution is increased in the upstream mountainous area and the downstream desert oasis area Coefficient. The spatial distribution of urban population density in river basin is simulated by using the exponential model. Based on the above methods, the population spatial distribution results of 25m grid in Heihe River Basin and the data of 1km grid on scale are finally obtained.            At the township level, the accuracy of the results of population spatialization is verified, and compared with the population data of Heihe River Basin estimated by the existing databases (GPW 1995, UNEP / grid1995, landscan 2002 and cn2000pop). The results show that the methods and models used in this study can obtain more accurate spatial distribution data of population in the basin.",

                    "Answer": "Creating gridded population datasets involves using 1:100,000 land use data and county-level population statistics to generate a population grid. This process includes the application of principal component and factor analysis to extract factors from district indicators, followed by hierarchical clustering to divide the basin into population distribution characteristic areas. Linear regression models are established between rural residential areas, cultivated land area, and rural population, with necessary adjustments made to population coefficients in different regions. A power exponential model simulates urban population density spatial distribution, resulting in a final 25m grid and an upscaled 1km grid of population spatial distribution.",

It utilizes a linear regression model based on rural residential land, cultivated land area, and rural population data to adjust population coefficients according to different distribution characteristics, enhancing accuracy. Comparatively, this approach showed higher precision when validated against township-level data and existing databases like GPW 1995, UNEP/GRID1995, LandScan 2002, and cn2000pop.",

                    "Answer": "The use of principal component analysis and factor analysis in data collection processes for river basin population distributions allows for the extraction of key factors from complex datasets. By identifying these factors, researchers can effectively categorize regions with distinct population distribution characteristics. This approach facilitates a nuanced understanding of how population spreads across different geographic and socio-economic zones, such as urban areas, rural lands, and transition zones between them. The application of these statistical methods leads to a more accurate modeling of population density and distribution, tailored to the unique features of each sub-region within the basin.",

                    "Answer": "The need arises from the diverse geographic and demographic characteristics within the river basin, which include midstream oases, upstream mountainous areas, and downstream desert oasis zones. These variations require different population distribution coefficients to account for the unique land use and population dynamics in each region, such as adjusting agricultural population coefficients in midstream oases and adding grassland population coefficients in upstream and downstream areas.",

This method allows for more precise modeling of population distribution, as it accounts for various influencing factors, resulting in higher accuracy in the spatial representation of population data across different regions, as demonstrated by comparisons with existing databases.",

Principal component and factor analysis are applied to extract four factors from 11 regional indicators, which are then used for hierarchical clustering to divide the river basin into four characteristic population distribution areas. A linear regression model is established between rural residential land, cultivated land area, and rural population, with adjustments made based on different population distribution characteristics, such as modifying cultivated land coefficients in the middle oasis and increasing grassland coefficients in the upstream mountainous and downstream desert oasis areas. A power exponential model is used to simulate the spatial distribution of urban population density. Using these methods, a 25m grid of population spatial distribution is generated, which is then scaled up to 1km grid data. The results are validated at the township level and compared with existing databases to ensure higher accuracy in spatial distribution data.",
