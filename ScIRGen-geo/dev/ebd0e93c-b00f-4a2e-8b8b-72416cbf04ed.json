                "Land surface temperature (LST) drives the thermal exchange processes for land–atmosphere interactions and has been recognized as one of the essential climate variables (ECVs) for its key role in the study of climate change and Earth system science. Generally, we can obtain LST by ground measurement, land surface modeling, and satellite remote sensing. The retrieval of LST from satellite thermal infrared (TIR) observations has achieved great success, and many well-known LST products have been produced and freely released to the public. However, cloudy-sky conditions, which account for more than half of the actual weather on the global scale, block TIR sensors from receiving ground signals. Microwave remote sensing is also an effective way of estimating LST, especially under cloudy-sky conditions, but the spatial resolution and accuracy of microwave LST are inferior to that of the TIR LST; even microwave remote sensing can obtain LST under all-weather conditions. Since LST exhibits rapid diurnal variation linked to the land–atmosphere energy exchange and the water cycle, TIR data with the high temporal resolution offered by geostationary satellite sensors have a tremendous advantage in monitoring diurnal LST variations."

Furthermore, the reconstructed LST is typically the hypothetical cloud-free LST, in which a nonnegligible bias will be introduced due to the absence of the cloud radiative effects (CREs)."
