            "description": "This data is zircon trace data and U-Pb age data of Kanawa uranium bearing mineral granite in hawal block, Eastern Nigeria. Trace element data and U-Pb annual forest data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the obtained data, combined with previous research data, mineralogical, geochemical and isotopic markers can be used to study the source of uranium, and reconstruct the formation stage conducive to mineralization in magmatic hydrothermal process, which plays a guiding role in uranium prospecting in the hawal block of eastern Nigeria and enriches the regional geological data.",
