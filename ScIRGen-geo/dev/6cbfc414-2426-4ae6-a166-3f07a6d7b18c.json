            "description": "To analyzing the distribution pattern and genetic background of domain domestic animals in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding regions and building a genetic resources bank of animals and plants in Pan-Third Pole, we collected 343 domain domestic animal samples in 2018, including Tibet pigs, Tibet dogs, Tibet sheep and Tibet chickens in Yunnan, Sichuan and Tibet Province. By applying mitochondrial DNA sequencing on 159 chickens from northwest Yunnan and southeast Tibet, genome resequencing on 11 wild and domestic pigs and GBS sequencing on 193 domestic cattle, a batch of genetic and genome data were generated. It provides basic genetic data to analysis on domestication, immigration and expansion of domestic animals in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Meanwhile it helps better understand the adaption of domestic animals to Qinghai-Tibet Plateau environment.",
