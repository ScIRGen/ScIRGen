The observation point is located in Gaoya National Hydrological Station, zhaojiatunzhuang, Ganzhou District, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The riverbed is sandy gravel with stable section. The longitude and latitude of the observation point are n39 ° 08'06.35 \", E100 ° 25'58.23\", 1420 m above sea level, and 50 m wide river channel. Hobo pressure water level gauge is used for water level observation, with acquisition frequency of 60 minutes. Data description includes the following two parts:\nWater level observation, 60 minutes in unit (cm) in 2014; Data covers the period of January 1, 2014 solstice December 31, 2014; Flow observation, unit (m3); According to the monitoring flow of different water levels, the flow curve of water levels was obtained, and the change process of runoff was obtained by observing the process of water levels.The missing data are uniformly represented by the string -6999.\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Li et al.(2013), and for observation data processing, please refer to He et al.(2016).",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
