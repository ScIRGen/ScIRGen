            "description": "Under the background of global warming, mountain glaciers worldwide are facing strong ablation and retreat, but from existing field observations, it is found that most of the glaciers in the Karakorum region remain stable or are advancing, which is called the ＂Karakorum anomaly＂. Glacier surface velocity is an important parameter for studying glacier dynamics and mass balance. Studying the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of glacier velocity in central Karakorum is significant for understanding the dynamic characteristics of the glacier in this region and its response to climate change.\nFour pairs of Landsat 7 ETM+ images acquired in 1999 to 2003 (images acquired on 1999.7.16, 2000.6.16, 2001.7.21, 2002.8.9, 2002.4.19, 2003.3.21) were selected; using the panchromatic band with a resolution of 15 m, each pair of images was accurately registered, and then cross-correlation calculations were then performed on each image pair after registration to obtain the surface velocity of the glacier in the central Karakorum region from 1999 to 2003. Due to the lack of velocity observation data in the study area, the accuracy of the ice flow results is estimated using the offset value of the stable region, and the surface velocity error of the glacier is approximately ±7 m/year.\nThe glacier velocity data dates are from 1999 to 2003, with a temporal resolution of one year. They cover the central Karakorum region, with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The data are stored as a GeoTIFF file every year. \nFor details regarding the data, please refer to the data description.",

Glacier surface velocity is one of the key parameters of glacier dynamics and mass balance, however, the response of glacier motion to this regional anomaly is not fully understood. Field observations and geodetic measurements suggest that glaciers in the Karakoram Range are either stable or have been expanding since 1990 and present positive or less negative mass changes. As one of the most glaciated regions outside of the polar regions, the Central Karakoram has experienced a slight gain in glacier mass at the beginning of the 21st century. The snow and glacial melt in this region is an important source of water for the Indus River in Pakistan and the Yarkant River in China. Glacier dynamics in the Central Karakoram have a significant influence on the hydrological cycle, especially hydrological planning and water resource management. As one of the crucial factors in mass balance and glacier dynamics, the glacier surface velocity provides an indicator of glacier recession or advance/surge and has been used to interpret glacier dynamics. Therefore, the spatial-temporal characteristics of the glacier velocity in this region are essential to improve our understanding of glacier dynamics and the glacier responses to climate change and influences on regional water sources."

Furthermore, ice motion observations over four years reveal that most of the glaciers were quasi-stable or experienced small fluctuations of flow velocity during our study period. We identify a new surging event for the South Skamri Glacier in the study period by investigating the glacier frontal changes and the longer-term time series of surface velocities between 1996 and 2006. From the transverse velocity profiles of seven typical glaciers, we infer that basal sliding is the predominant motion mechanism of the middle and upper glaciers, whereas internal deformation dominates closest to the glacier terminus."
