            "description": "This data is for the vegetation types in the 10km buffer zone of Golmud Nagqu and Gonghe Yushu high-grade highways. By fully utilizing the advantages of multi-source vegetation classification/land cover classification products, a vegetation classification system suitable for the vegetation types on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was specially designed, and an integrated classification method was selected. Based on the reliability of the data and the principle of consistency, the current vegetation map was created, which is in line with the current situation The specificity and classification accuracy of the classification system perform better than existing relevant data. At present, it can provide a scientific basis for the research on the background of geological disasters, and in the future, it can be applied to more geological and geographical related fields.",
