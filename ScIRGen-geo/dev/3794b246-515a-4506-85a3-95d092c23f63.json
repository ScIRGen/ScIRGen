            "description": "The maximum freezing depth is an important index of the thermal state of seasonal frozen ground. Due to global warming, the maximum freezing depth of seasonal frozen ground continues to decline. The maximum freezing depth data set of five provinces in Northwest China, Tibet and surrounding areas from 1961 to 2020 was released, with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The data set is a support vector regression (SVR) model based on the measured data of maximum freezing depth from 2001 to 2010 and spatial environmental variables, which simulates the maximum freezing depth in Northwest China, Tibet and surrounding areas from 1961 to 2020. The validation results show that the SVR model has good spatial generalization ability, and there is a high consistency between the predicted value and the observed value of the maximum soil freezing depth. The determination coefficients of the simulation results in the four periods of 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s are 0.77, 0.83, 0.73 and 0.71 respectively. The percentile range of the prediction results shows that the simulation results have good stability. Based on this data set, it is found that the maximum soil freezing depth in Northwest China continues to decline, among which Qinghai has the fastest decline rate, with an average decline of 0.53 cm every decade. The data set provides data support for the study of seasonal frozen soil in Northwest China, High Mountain Asia and the Third Pole.",
