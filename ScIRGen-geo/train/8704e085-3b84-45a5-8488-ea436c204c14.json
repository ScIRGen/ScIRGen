Additionally, TPRED’s monthly ET estimates closely align with expected seasonal fluctuations, as reflected by a CC ranging from 0.94 to 0.98 when contrasted with alternative ET products. Furthermore, TPRED’s annual values exhibit commendable concordance with operational products across multiple dimensions.
