Zircon U-Pb isotopic data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, zircon Hf isotopic data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and major mineral elements were obtained by electron probe analysis. The main and trace geochemical data of the whole rock were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively, and the whole rock isotopic data were obtained by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Through the data obtained, the age and chemical composition of the deep crust in the region are limited, and the structure of the lower crust is reconstructed.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of mineral U-Pb and Hf isotopic data, along with whole-rock geochemical analyses, allows researchers to determine the age and chemical composition of deep crustal rocks. U-Pb dating provides precise age constraints on zircon minerals, while Hf isotopic data offers insights into the source characteristics and evolution of these minerals. Whole-rock geochemical analyses, using both major and trace elements, further define the overall chemical makeup of the crustal rocks. Together, these data enable the reconstruction of the age and chemical evolution of deep crustal structures, offering a comprehensive view of the geological history and processes in the North China Craton.",

It allows for detailed insights into the temporal evolution and chemical composition of crustal structures, which is crucial for reconstructing lower crustal structures.",

This process involves using a laser to ablate a small portion of the zircon mineral, which is then ionized in the plasma. The resulting ions are measured by the mass spectrometer to determine isotopic ratios, such as zircon U-Pb isotopes for dating purposes, and zircon Hf isotopes for mineral isotopic data.",
