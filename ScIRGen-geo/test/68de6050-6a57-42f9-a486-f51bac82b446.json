There are four recorded stations near Dhaka city. The monitoring data of meteorological stations have the characteristics of high precision. Firstly, the monitoring data of stations in the world are downloaded from NCEI, and then four stations in Dhaka city are selected according to longitude and latitude. The data level records the daily meteorological station monitoring data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019.",
