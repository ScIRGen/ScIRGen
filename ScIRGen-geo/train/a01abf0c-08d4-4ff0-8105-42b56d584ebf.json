            "description": "The microthermometry of fluid inclusions was carried out in the laboratory of geological fluids, Department of geology, University of Regina, Canada. The Linkam THMs 600 geological cold hot table made in England was used and connected with Olympus BX 51 microscope. Before the test, synthetic CO2-H2O (CO2 melting temperature – 56.6 ℃) was used ° C) And H2O (freezing point 0 ° C. The supercritical temperature is 374.1 ℃ ° C) The hot and cold stage is corrected by fluid inclusion. The temperature range is - 180 – 400 ° C. The measurement accuracy of the freezing point temperature (TM ice), CO2 phase melting temperature (TM CO2), CO2 hydrate melting temperature (TM CL) and CO2 phase homogenization temperature (th CO2) is 0 ±  zero point two ° C. The measurement accuracy of homogenization temperature (th) of fluid inclusions is 0 ±  two ° C。\nAccording to the micro temperature measurement data of fluid inclusions, the software \"fluids\" was used to calculate the isochore of fluid inclusions (Baker, 2003). The fluid inclusion in aqueous solution is regarded as H2O NaCl system, and the fluid density is calculated according to the homogenization temperature and salinity (according to the empirical equation of state of Bodnar et al., 1993) by using \"bulk\" software. Then, according to the empirical equation of state of Bodnar and vityk (1994), the isovolumic curve is calculated by using \"bisoc\" software. For fluid inclusions containing CO2, they are regarded as h2o-nacl-co2 system. The composition and temperature pressure conditions of fluid inclusions are calculated by using the equations of \"flincor\" software (Bowers and Helgeson, 1983) and brown and lamb (1989).\nThe laser Raman measurement was carried out in the geological fluid Laboratory of the Department of geology, University of Regina, Canada. The instrument used was the RM2000 Renishaw laser Raman spectrometer made in the UK, which was used to analyze the gas and fluid components in a single fluid inclusion. An AR atomic laser with 514nm wavelength, 50 times objective magnification and 1800 Gr / mm grating is used.",
