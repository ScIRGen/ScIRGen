            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Sidaoqiao Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2019. The site (101.137° E, 42.001° N) was located on a tamarix (Tamarix chinensis Lour.) surface in the Sidaoqiao, Dalaihubu Town, Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The elevation is 873 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HC2S3; 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 28 m, towards north), wind speed profile (010C; 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 28 m, towards north), wind direction profile (020C; 15 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; in waterproof box), rain gauge (TE525M; 28 m, towards south), four-component radiometer (CNR4; 10 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 10 m, towards south, vertically downward), two photosynthetically active radiation (PQS-1; 10 m, towards south, one vertically upward and one vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFP01SC; 3 duplicates with G1 below the tamarix; G2 and G3 between plants, -0.06 m), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (installed on 17 July, 2013, TCAV; -0.02, -0.04 m), soil temperature profile (109ss-L; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2.0 m), and soil moisture profile (install on 7 December, 2013, ML2X; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2.0 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m, Ta_7 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m, Ta_20 m and Ta_28 m; RH_5 m, RH_7 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m, RH_20 m and RH_28 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_5 m, Ws_7 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m, Ws_20 m and Ws_28 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_15 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_up and PAR_down) (μmol/ (s m^-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, Ts_160 cm, Ts_200 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, Ms_160 cm, Ms_200 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. Data of soil temperature at 2m depth during April to October, and infrared temperature 2 after November 13 were wrong because of the sensor problem; the soil temperature and moisture was occasionally wrong after September 15 because of datalogger problem. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2019-9-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "A comprehensive observation network in meteorological research refers to a system of interconnected observation stations that collect various atmospheric and surface data, such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, pressure, precipitation, radiation, and soil conditions. These networks aim to provide detailed and continuous data to understand and monitor environmental processes over time. The example provided includes sensors installed at different heights and depths to gather a wide range of meteorological and soil data, with strict data quality control measures in place to ensure accuracy and reliability.",

                    "Answer": "Errors during data collection can arise from sensor malfunctions, as seen with the 2m depth soil temperature sensor errors from April to October and infrared temperature data issues after November 13. Additionally, external factors like environmental conditions and instrument calibration can lead to data inaccuracies, such as soil moisture and temperature data errors after September 15. Quality control measures, including the removal of physically implausible data and duplicate records, are essential to mitigate these errors.",

                    "Answer": "Implementing multiple layers of weather sensors at varying heights can lead to more accurate and reliable datasets by capturing the vertical gradient and variation in meteorological elements like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric profile, which is crucial for modeling and predicting weather patterns. However, it may also introduce challenges such as sensor calibration, maintenance complexity, and increased chances of data gaps due to sensor failures or environmental interference.",

                    "Answer": "In a meteorological gradient observation system, sensors such as air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed sensors are installed at multiple heights (5m, 7m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 28m) facing north to capture gradient data. The wind direction sensor is placed at 15m. Calibration involves ensuring each sensor is correctly oriented and securely mounted to avoid misalignment due to environmental factors. Regular maintenance checks are performed to confirm sensors are functioning correctly and data is consistently recorded every 10 minutes. Any date or time inconsistencies or sensor malfunctions leading to errors are marked, such as with a placeholder like -6999 for missing data, and faulty data due to sensor issues are noted for specific periods. Quality control processes include removing duplicate records and data exceeding physical or instrumental limits, with questionable data highlighted for review.",
