            "description": "The results show that the whole rock SR Nd isotopic composition of the basic rocks in the ophiolite of rencuo (Shenzha bange county) in the North Lake area of Tibet. The purpose of this analysis is to clarify the characteristics of magma mantle source area of basic rock unit in ophiolite, and provide key evidence for further constraining the genesis of ophiolite and clarifying its type. The data analysis and testing were completed in Wuhan Shangpu analysis and testing company, and the pre-processing was completed in the 1000 level ultra clean room equipped with 100 level operation platform. The isotope analysis was performed by MC-ICP-MS (Neptune plus) of Thermo Fisher Scientific Company in Germany, and the data acquisition was composed of 8 blocks, each block contained 10 cycles, and each cycle was 4.194 seconds.\nThis set of data samples meet the analysis requirements with high accuracy, which can be used to further constrain the genesis and tectonic classification of Ophiolites in the central Tethys orogenic belt.",

                    "Answer": "The Sr-Nd isotope data can provide crucial information about the mantle source characteristics of the mafic rocks within the ophiolite complexes. These isotope ratios help in identifying the types of mantle sources involved, which can indicate whether the rocks originated from a depleted or enriched mantle source. This information is pivotal in determining the genesis of the ophiolites and their tectonic classifications within the context of the Central Tethyan orogenic belt. The high precision of the isotope analysis methods, like those done using MC-ICP-MS, ensures that these inferences are reliable and can significantly contribute to the broader understanding of the geological processes at play in the region.",
