            "description": "The Late Paleozoic carbonate strata are well developed from Lewuqi County to Jiangda County in the Changdu area, eastern Xizang. The previous biostratigraphic studies based on macro-fossils (e.g. brachiopod and coral) are not sufficient for high resolution correlation.  The seemingly continuous strata at Tuoba and Wuqingna have been divided as Zhuogedong Formation (or Qiangge Formation) of Late Devonian and Wuqingna Formation of Early Carboniferous mainly by lithology. We made detailed sampling for conodont, sedimentary and geochemical research at the outcrops between Tuoba and Wuqingna near Nuoma Village which according to the unpublished data belong to the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary interval. This study is significant for high resolution correlation of Late Devonian and Early Carboniferous in this region and the global stratotype study. The dataset only includes the stratigraphic column and photo of the section. The bio-chronological information will be added in the future.",

This approach was applied to the carbonate rock strata near Nuoma Village in the Karuo District of Chamdo City, focusing on the Devonian to Carboniferous boundary layers. The use of conodont elements, known for their stratigraphic precision, paired with sedimentological and geochemical sampling, offers a potential improvement over traditional macrofossil indicators, which often lack the necessary resolution.",

These methods are intended to enhance the precision of biostratigraphic comparisons in the region. However, despite the richness of macrofossils like brachiopods and corals, the resolution and precision of these fossils have been historically low.

This includes sampling of conodont fossils and conducting geochemical analyses. The samples are gathered from well-exposed stratigraphic sections that span the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary to refine biostratigraphic correlations. Detailed sedimentological and geochemical sampling is performed to gather sufficient data for analysis. These procedures aim to enhance the resolution and precision of fossil-based biostratigraphic studies in the region.",
