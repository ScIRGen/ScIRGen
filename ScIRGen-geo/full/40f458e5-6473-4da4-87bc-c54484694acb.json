            "description": "This dataset is a continuous ground observation data of vegetation coverage (%), biomass (g/plant), leaf area index (LAI) and plant height (cm) of seed corn during the growing period in 2015 at Daman Station ( 38.85551N,100.37223E)in the middle reaches of the Heihe River. Ground observation was carried out in three sample plots.  Biomass observation included fresh and dry aboveground biomass, fresh and dry underground biomass (fresh and dry root weight), vegetation coverage was observed by digital camera, leaf area index was observed by LAI 2200, and plant height was observed by tape measure. The observation period was from May 10 to September 21, 2015, in which LAI started from May 25. Observation parameters were observed every 5 days before July 31 and every 10 days thereafter, and a total of 21 observations (LAI was 18) were carried out during the whole growing period. The dataset can provide data basis for inversion and validation of surface vegetation parameters.",

                    "Answer": "To collect data on vegetation coverage, a digital camera is used to take photographs. Biomass data collection involves measuring both fresh and dry weight for above-ground and underground biomass, including root weight, using standard weighing techniques. The leaf area index is measured using an LAI 2200 instrument, and plant height is measured with a tape measure. Observations are conducted over a defined period, with parameters measured every five days until July 31st, and every ten days thereafter, resulting in a total of 21 observation sessions for the growing season, with 18 sessions specifically for LAI measurements.",
