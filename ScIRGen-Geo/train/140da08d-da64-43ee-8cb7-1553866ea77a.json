The results showed that the difference of canopy apparent photosynthetic rate (CAP) of C. potanini in different years and months was significant, the canopy photosynthesis was enhanced significantly with improving soil water. The soil CO2 efflux rate under plant canopy was 0.29 μmol/(m2·s) in the growth period, and it was 0.15 μmol/(m2·s) in desert bare land. The fixed carbon of C. potanini canopy in the growth period was 3.82 g/(m2·a), the released carbon under plant canopy was 1.03 and 0.53 g/(m2·a) in desert bare land in the same period. These results indicated that the increasing in canopy apparent photosynthetic rate of desert plant C. potanini exceeded the increasing range of soil water in the layers of root mainly distributed in the water shortage desert area; it doubled in suitable environment period. The soil respiration rate of desert ecosystem was lower and that in desert bare land was about 50% of that under plant canopy.

For plant canopy gas exchange measurements, a system composed of the LI-8100 soil CO2 flux automated measurement system and an improved assimilation chamber was used. The assimilation chamber, designed by Beijing Ligotai Technology Co., was made of acrylic material with a light transmittance of over 95% and had dimensions of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm. During measurements, the assimilation chamber was placed on the base, connected to the LI-8100, and the remaining soil was backfilled to ensure the airtightness of the connection between the chamber and the base."
