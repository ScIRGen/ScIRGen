      "description": "In this dataset, tree recruitment series from 1951-2010 were collected from existing treeline studies across the northern Hemisphere. They could be used to study the forest dynamics in response to climate change. All of these recruitment series were z-score and in decadal resolution. These data could be considered in the Earth's system models to accurately predict the changes of terrestrial ecosystem in future.",
