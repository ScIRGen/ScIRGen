            "description": "This dataset contains the soil moisture data from August 31, 2020 to December 22, 2020 (except some data interruption events in short durations due to rainfall and field irrigation). This instrument is installed at the Yucheng Comprehensive Experimental Station, CAS (Yucheng, Shandong，116°22' E，36°40'N，23m above sea level) in the field of winter wheat and summer maize during the monitoring period. The instrument was place directly on the smooth ground so that it’s close contact with soil surface.\nThe data sampling interval is once an hour which can be remotely set through the app installed in a mobile phone or manually monitor any time in situ. The instrument can collect the frequency values by three groups of electrodes with different specifications passing through the soil profile. The data processing procedure is as follow: the different frequency values collected by this instrument will be uploaded to the cloud platform through the Internet of Things；the system removes abnormal values from database；averages and normalizes the remaining data, and then calculates and outputs soil volumetric moisture at different soil layers by a built-in calibration function.",

However, new techniques in the big data era have rarely been introduced into operational ecosystem monitoring, particularly for fragile ecosystems in remote areas. Ecosystem monitoring can be defined as a time series of measurements of key variables in the biosphere and is designed to detect variability in ecosystem dynamics and ultimately answer questions regarding biospheric changes. Driven by the advancement of smart devices and rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), ecosystem monitoring has entered a new paradigm: monitoring the ecosystem based on the IoT.
