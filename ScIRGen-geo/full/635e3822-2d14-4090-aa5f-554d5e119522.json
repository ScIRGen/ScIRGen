            "description": "The dataset of runoff plot observations was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental area from Jun. 19 to Oct. 17, 2008. The runoff plot (38°03′, 100°13′, 3472m, with a slope of 20.16°) was 10m long, 5m wide and 80cm deep, with soil depth about 50cm and sandy clay and gravels beneath (50-80cm). The main vegetation type is scrub (about 20cm high) and grass (about 3cm high). \n     Observation items included the surface flow, interflow (80cm down the land surface), and precipitation at a fixed point at the right of the runoff plot.\n     One subfolder and two data files (directions on data observations and raw data) were archived.",

The area is characterized by shrub and grassland vegetation, with shrub heights around 20cm and grass heights averaging 3cm. The soil profile consists of 0-50cm clay, followed by sand and gravel up to 80cm. The runoff field comprises protective strips, embankments, permeable surfaces, water troughs, water pipes, and an observation room. Surface and subsurface runoff are measured during typical precipitation events using a graduated cylinder to capture flow rates at the surface level and 80cm below the surface, with additional single-point rainfall observations conducted adjacent to the runoff field.",

This knowledge can help in assessing the impact of precipitation on runoff, soil erosion, and the hydrological cycle, particularly in areas with significant slopes and diverse soil compositions.

The field is set on a slope with a 20.16-degree incline, covered with shrubs and grass. Observation begins by monitoring the surface flow at 0cm and subsurface flow at 80cm during typical rainfall events. Additionally, single-point rainfall is recorded on the right side of the runoff field. Runoff volume is measured using a graduated cylinder.",
