            "description": "This data set contains the surface temperature and surface emissivity products retrieved from 12 ASTER data in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin in 2012. The 12 scenes ASTER data all cover the ecological and hydrological experimental area of the middle reaches artificial oasis. The acquisition time (Beijing time) is: 2012-05-302012-06-152012-06-242012-07-102012-08-02, 2012-08-112012-08-182012-08-272012-09-03, 2012-09-122012-09-192012-09-28. The transit time of the above data is around 12:15 (Beijing time).            \nFirstly, the L1B data is corrected by aster L3 data, and then the L1B data is corrected by MODIS mod07 atmospheric profile product with the same transit time and the atmospheric radiation transfer model MODTRAN. In order to improve the accuracy of atmospheric correction, the water vapor scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction method is used. Finally, the aster temperature emissivity separation (TES) algorithm is used to retrieve the surface temperature and the surface emissivity of five bands. The results show that the average deviation of surface temperature products is less than 0.5K and RMSE is less than 2K. This data set can provide reliable input data for remote sensing estimation of key water and heat variables of heterogeneous surface.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
