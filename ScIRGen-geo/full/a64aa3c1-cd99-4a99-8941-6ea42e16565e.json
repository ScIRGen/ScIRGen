            "description": "\"This dataset contains high-frequency observations of soil temperature and moisture in the active layer of permafrost in the Qianhuli watershed of the Qinghai Lake alpine meadow. The data were collected at a fixed observation point at coordinates E100°15, 37°25’N, and an elevation of 3575m. The observation point is located in Sanda Village, Triangle City, Gangcha County, Haibei Prefecture, Qinghai Province. It is situated on the eastern side of the valley of the Shaliu River, a tributary of the Sanda River, and represents a typical alpine meadow landscape. The dataset includes observations at different soil depths: 10 soil moisture levels (5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 100cm, 120cm, 140cm, 160cm, and 180cm), 10 soil temperature levels (5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 100cm, 120cm, 140cm, 160cm, and 180cm), and 10 soil dielectric constant levels (5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 100cm, 120cm, 140cm, 160cm, and 180cm). The data files are labeled from 1 to 10, corresponding to the respective soil depths. The original data collected by the sensors were standardized to a 30-minute sampling interval and underwent preliminary quality control. The organized data were then stored in 30-minute intervals, with the file names indicating the date of the data. The observation period for the data is from November 5, 2018, to December 21, 2012. However, there is a significant amount of missing data for the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2022.\"",
