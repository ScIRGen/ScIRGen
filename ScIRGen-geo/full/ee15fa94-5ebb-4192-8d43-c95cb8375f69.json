            "description": "The map is \"1:4 Million Ice, Snow and Frozen Soil Map of China\" compiled by Mr. Shi Yafeng and Mr. Meadson. The working map compiled by the map is \"Chinese Pinyin Edition of the People's Republic of China\", which retains the water system and mountain annotation of the map and adds some mountain annotation.  The compilation of frozen soil map is based on the actual data of frozen soil survey and exploration, interpretation of remote sensing data, temperature conditions and topographic characteristics that affect the formation and distribution of frozen soil.  The height of glacier snow line is expressed by isolines.  Seasonal snow accumulation and seasonal icing are based on the data of 1600 meteorological observation stations and the results of many years of investigation in China. They are expressed by isoline notation and symbols. The selection of cold (periglacial) phenomena is a representative and schematic representation observed on the spot.  The boundary line between permafrost and non-permafrost is mapped by calculation based on the field data, and its comprehensive degree is relatively high (Tö pfer, 1982)\n\"China Ice and Snow Frozen Soil Map\" reflects the scale, types and characteristics of distribution of glaciers, snow cover, frozen soil and periglacial, as well as its value in scientific research and the prospect of utilization and prevention in production practice.  It shows our achievements in glacier and frozen soil research in the past 30 years.",
