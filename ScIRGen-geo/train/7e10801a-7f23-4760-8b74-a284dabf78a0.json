                    "Answer": "The data collection method using the 1:10万地形图 and 2009年TM遥感影像 is specifically tailored for capturing detailed river system features, including perennial and seasonal rivers, dry channels, and surface canals, with a focus on the Heihe River Basin. This method provides a comprehensive geospatial dataset with attributes such as river grade, code, and name, using the Strahler grading system for classification. Compared to other remote sensing techniques, this approach might offer distinct advantages in capturing fine-scale hydrological features and standardizing geographic information elements based on national data dictionaries. However, it may also face challenges such as the resolution limitations of available imagery and the inherent static nature of the 2009 baseline, which could impact the temporal accuracy when compared to more recent or higher-resolution remote sensing technologies.",
