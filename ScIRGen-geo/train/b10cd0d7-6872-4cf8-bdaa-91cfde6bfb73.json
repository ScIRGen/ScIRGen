            "description": "By archaeological investigation and excavation in Tibetan Plateau, we discovered 8 Neolithic and Bronze Age sites, including Gaomuxudi, Duojialiang, Shuikou, Qipanshan, Xinzhai, Canxionggasu, Niaodao, Bangga, Baiyangcun and so on. In this dataset, there are some basic informations about these sites, such as location, longitude, latitude, altitude, material culture and so on. On this Basis, we identified animal remains, plant macrofossil, selected some samples for radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. This dataset provide important basic data for understanding when and how prehistoric human lived in the Tibetan Plateau during the Neolithic and Bronze Age.",

Additionally, the goal is to scientifically collect, identify, and analyze animal and plant remains found during site investigations and excavations. This data collection aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of past human activities and subsistence patterns, including the historical activities and livelihood modes of ancient inhabitants in the region.
