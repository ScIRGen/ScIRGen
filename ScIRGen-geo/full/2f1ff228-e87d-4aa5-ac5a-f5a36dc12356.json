            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Zhangye wetland station from January 1 to December 31, 2023. The site (100.4464° E, 38.9751° N) was located on a wetland (reed surface) in Zhangye National Wetland Park, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1460 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45AC; 5 and 10 m, north), wind speed profile (03002; 5 and 10 m, north), wind direction profile (03002; 10 m, north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), four-component radiometer (CNR1; 6 m, south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (109ss-L; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2 and -0.4 m), and four photosynthetically active radiation (PQS-1; two above the plants, 6 m, south, one vertically downward and one vertically upward; two below the plants, 0.25 m, south, one vertically downward and one vertically upward).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and Ta_10 m; RH_5 m and RH_10 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_5 m and Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm and Ts_40 cm) (℃), on the plants photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_U_up and PAR_U_down) (μmol/ (s m^2)), and below the plants photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_D_up and PAR_D_down) (μmol/ (s m^2)).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2023-6-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information) and Liu et al. (2023).",

                    "Answer": "Data quality control in the context of meteorological datasets refers to the processes applied to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data collected from various sensors and instruments. It involves steps like ensuring the expected number of data points (e.g., 144 per day at 10-minute intervals), marking missing data with specific indicators (e.g., -6999), removing duplicate entries, deleting data that fall outside the physical or instrument range, and highlighting questionable data for further review.",

The observational network uses various sensors at different heights and depths to collect comprehensive data on meteorological and soil conditions. Proper data processing and quality control measures are necessary to address issues like missing data, duplicated records, and values that exceed physical or instrumental limits. These measures include marking missing data, removing redundant entries, deleting out-of-range data, and flagging questionable data for further review.",

It helps in identifying and correcting errors, such as missing data or values that exceed physical limits, thereby enhancing the overall integrity of the dataset. Additionally, it may reveal systematic issues across installations that can be addressed to improve future data collection efforts.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of collecting meteorological data using various sensors at different heights and orientations in the context of surface processes in wetland areas are to comprehensively monitor and understand the interactions between atmospheric conditions and wetland ecosystems. This involves capturing detailed data on air temperature, humidity, pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and radiation, which are crucial for analyzing environmental changes, understanding ecological dynamics, and supporting climate research. The data helps in studying the microclimate of wetlands, assessing the impact of climate variability, and aiding in the conservation and management of these critical ecosystems.",

Wind speed and direction sensors are placed at 5m and 10m, with the direction sensor facing north. A four-component radiometer is installed at 6m facing south, and infrared thermometers are mounted at 6m with downward-facing probes. Soil temperature probes are embedded at various depths and locations relative to the meteorological tower. A specific procedure for data quality control includes ensuring 144 data points per day, marking missing data with -6999, removing duplicates, deleting data exceeding physical significance or instrument limits, and marking questionable data in red.
