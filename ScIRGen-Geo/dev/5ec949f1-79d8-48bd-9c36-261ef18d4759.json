      "description": "Through the archaeological investigation and excavation of historical sites such as the site of Wuweicha Mountain Village, the site of Kaiyuan Temple in Zhengding and a large number of military sites in Xinjiang, the basic information of longitude and latitude, elevation, cultural attributes and cultural relics of the sites has been obtained. In addition, through scientific collection, identification and laboratory analysis of plant remains samples in the process of site investigation and excavation, a batch of site carbon 14th-century data, plant remains identification data, plant seed measurement and isotope data were obtained. At the same time, through the systematic carbon-14 dating of a large number of military-related sites (beacons and post stations) in Hami region of Xinjiang, combined with the results of the third cultural relics survey, the paper analyzed the spatio-temporal changes of human activities in this region during the historical period, and further combined with the historical documentation, archaeology and paleoclimate records. The influences of geopolitical change and climate change on human activities and regional social evolution are discussed.",
      "descriptionCn": "通过对武威岔山村遗址、正定开元寺遗址以及新疆大量军事遗址等历史时期遗址进行考古调查和发掘，获取了各遗址经纬度、高程、文化属性、文化遗物等基本信息；并且，对遗址调查和发掘过程中的植物遗存样品进行科学收集、鉴定和实验室分析，得到了一批遗址碳十四年代数据、植物遗存鉴定数据、植物种子测量和同位素数据；同时，通过新疆哈密地区大量军事相关遗址（烽燧和驿站）系统的碳十四年代测定，结合第三次文物普查结果分析了历史时期这一区域人类活动的时空变化过程，进一步结合历史文献记载，考古与古气候记录，讨论了地缘政治变化与气候变化对人类活动以及区域社会演化的影响。",
