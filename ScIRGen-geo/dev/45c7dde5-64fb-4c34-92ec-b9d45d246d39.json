            "description": "This dataset includes new archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data as well as 14C dating data from the Zongri site in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The first platform in the west of Dashagou (West 1st District) of Zongri Site was selected for drilling, and the area with deep accumulation of soil cultural layer was selected and excavated by exploration method (4Ã—4m), with a total excavation area of 16 square meters. The flotation sample method adopted is the mesh sampling method, which samples layer by layer and square by square. A total of 134 flotation soil samples were collected, with 2351 liters of soil recovered, with an average of 17.54 liters per sample. Archaeological studies have recorded the migration of farmers to the Tibetan Plateau during the Neolithic Period in 4000 BC. However, how these alien groups interacted with local indigenous foragers remains unclear. New archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data from Zonri sites in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau suggest that local foragers continued to hunt but supplemented their diets with agricultural products in the form of millet. The results of the study showed that the millet was not grown locally, but obtained through exchanges with farmers.",

                    "Answer": "The grid sampling method employed for flotation sample collection involves systematic sampling by layer and square, which may provide a structured and comprehensive approach to capturing archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data across a site. This method allows for the collection of a significant number of samples (134 in total) and large volumes of soil (2351 liters in total), which can enhance the detection of plant and animal remains. Compared to other methods that might not use a systematic grid or involve less frequent sampling, this approach could offer more detailed insights into the spatial distribution of archaeological finds and potentially increase the likelihood of uncovering interactions between Neolithic farmers and local foragers, such as through the exchange of millet.",

This indicates a form of interaction where the local foragers and Neolithic farmers engaged in trade, leading to an exchange of goods and possibly cultural practices.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of flotation sampling techniques in archaeological research on the Tibetan Plateau, such as the grid sampling method used at the Zongri site, is influenced by the need to systematically collect and analyze soil samples from different cultural layers. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the plant and animal remains that can provide insights into past human activities and interactions. Additionally, the depth and stratification of soil culture layers at the site may necessitate specific sampling techniques to ensure accurate and representative data collection.",

                    "Answer": "The use of a grid sampling method for soil collection in archaeological research can lead to a more systematic and thorough collection of soil samples, ensuring that samples are taken consistently across different strata and areas. This method allows researchers to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and density of archaeological plant and animal remains, as well as providing uniform data that can be more easily analyzed for patterns and trends in ancient human activities and interactions. Additionally, it can help in accurately dating the layers using methods like 14C dating, leading to a clearer timeline of historical events.",
