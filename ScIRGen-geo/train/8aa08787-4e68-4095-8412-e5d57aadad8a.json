            "description": "In this study, the beilianchi lake of Liupanshan in the Loess Plateau of northern China was selected to quantitatively reconstruct the high resolution (~ 30yr) warm season temperature series of northern China in the past 5000 years based on the gdgts index and the fitting equation established by reanalysis of global lake surface sediment gdgts data. In the past 5000 years, the overall temperature in northern China showed a downward trend, in which the temperature of 3000 bc-200 ad decreased slowly by ~ 0.5 ℃ and then decreased rapidly by ~ 4 ℃ after 200 ad, accompanied by four Millennium scale cold events of 2-3 ℃. At the same time, we reconstructed the monsoon precipitation changes since the middle late Holocene by using the single hydrogen isotope in the same borehole sediments. The monsoon precipitation in northern China showed a downward trend in the past 5000 years, accompanied by three obvious 100 year scale strong precipitation drought fluctuations.",

                "High-quality paleoclimate reconstructions can provide crucial climate context to test the hypothesis of climatic impact on historical culture changes. The Chinese civilization is the oldest and most enduring in the world. During its long lasting “5000-year” history, China has experienced a series of centennial-scale rise and fall of dynasties, unifications and divisions, war and peace. Climate changes have long been proposed as an important driver of these historical cultural changes. One of the important reasons for these inconsistent and even contradictory conclusions is the shortage of robust quantitative climate reconstructions, especially in the heartland of Chinese culture. Furthermore, high-resolution and reliable temperature records covering the “5000-year” Chinese history are quite lacking for the heartland of Chinese culture. The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is located near the present northwestern margin of East Asian summer monsoon, which is also a transition zone between semi-humid and semi-arid and the farming-pastoral ecotone of north China. Over the past decade, a large number of monsoon precipitation records in the CLP have been reconstructed, some of them can present reliable precipitation changes for the past 5000 years of Chinese history. Unfortunately, reliable temperature records are still limited, in particular most available records are qualitative rather than quantitative reconstructions. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are membrane-spanning lipids produced by heterotrophic bacteria containing two C28 alkyl chains with 4e6 methyl substituents and 0e2 cyclopenthy moieties. Because the bacteria can produce more/less methyl branches to adjust to colder/warmer conditions, and thus brGDGTs have been proposed as a novel proxy for quantitative temperature reconstructions in terrestrial settings such as soils, peats and lakes over the past decade."

The sediment cores were subsampled at every 1-cm interval, and seven terrestrial plant macrofossils were analyzed by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at Beta Laboratory (Zhang et al., 2019a). A total of 20 surface samples, including 9 lake surface sediments and 11 surface soils, and 171 downcore samples from core BLC13B were analyzed for GDGTs following the chemical pretreatment (Feng et al., 2019). Each sediment sample from core BLC13B was freeze-dried and homogenized before being pretreated for GDGTs. 3-5 g sediment samples were ultrasonically extracted using dichloromethane: methanol (9:1, v/v, 15 min, 4°C). The total lipids were concentrated with N2 gas and saponified for more than 12 h with 6% KOH in methanol solution. The neutral lipids were extracted using n-hexane four times and then separated into apolar and polar fractions through silica gel column chromatography by n-hexane and MeOH, respectively. The polar fraction, containing the GDGTs, was filtered through a 0.45mm PTFE filter before analysis. GDGTs were analyzed using the improved chromatographic procedure with full separation of 5- and 6-methyl isomers, by HPLC-APCI-MS (Shimadzu LCeMS 8030) equipped with two coupled Inertsil SIL-100A silica columns (each 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 3µm; GL sciences Inc.) at the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Wang et al., 2016)."
