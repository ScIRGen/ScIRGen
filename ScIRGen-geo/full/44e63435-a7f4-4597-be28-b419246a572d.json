            "description": "The dataset is the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) products from 1980s to 2019 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the FVC equation which is based on dimidiate pixel model of NDVI.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.FVC is an important ecological parameter, which is widely used in ecological environmnet monitoring .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the FVC result of each scense is stored in a floder including the FVC band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-FVC;the FVC is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the FVC results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the unit of the FVC results is %, for exmaple the value is 80, that means the fractional vegetation is 80%, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "Using the NDVI pixel dichotomy model to derive FVC allows for a standardized approach to assess vegetation coverage across long-term satellite data. This method, which assumes NDVI values of 0.01 for bare soil and 0.88 for pure vegetation, can lead to consistent and comparable results over time, making it valuable for ecological monitoring. However, it also requires precise calibration and validation to ensure accuracy, particularly in diverse and dynamic ecosystems like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The quality indicators for cloud and snow may further enhance the dataset's reliability and usability in ecological research.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures involve using a pixel dichotomy model to invert the NDVI values from surface reflectance data of the Landsat series satellites. In this specific approach, the NDVI value for bare soil is set at 0.01, while for pure vegetation, it is set at 0.88.",
