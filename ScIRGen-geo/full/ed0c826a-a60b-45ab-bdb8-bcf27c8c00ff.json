            "description": "The dataset is the normalized burnt ratio (NBR) products of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the NBR equation which use the difference ratio between the NIR band and SWIR1 band to enhance the feature of the burned area.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.NBR is usually used to extract burned area information effectively,  and to monitor the vegetation restoration in burned area .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the NBR result of each scense is stored in a floder including the NBR band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NBR\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NBR;the NBR is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NBR.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NBR.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the NBR results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the NBR results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
