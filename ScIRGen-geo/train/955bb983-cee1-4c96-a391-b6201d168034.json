            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Zhangye wetland station from January 1 to December 31, 2018. The site (100.4464° E, 38.9751° N) was located on a wetland (reed surface) in Zhangye National Wetland Park, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1460 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45AC; 5 and 10 m, north), wind speed profile (03002; 5 and 10 m, north), wind direction profile (03002; 10 m, north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), four-component radiometer (CNR1; 6 m, south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (109ss-L; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2 and -0.4 m), and four photosynthetically active radiation (PQS-1; two above the plants, 6 m, south, one vertically downward and one vertically upward; two below the plants, 0.25 m, south, one vertically downward and one vertically upward).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and Ta_10 m; RH_5 m and RH_10 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_5 m and Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm and Ts_40 cm) (℃), on the plants photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_U_up and PAR_U_down) (μmol/ (s m^-2)), and below the plants photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_D_up and PAR_D_down) (μmol/ (s m^-2)).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018-6-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "A 'comprehensive observation network' in the context of environmental data collection refers to a coordinated system of various sensors and instruments set up to monitor and record different environmental parameters across a specific area. This includes the collection of data such as air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction, radiation, surface and soil temperature, soil heat flux, and photosynthetically active radiation. The data collected is often used to study and understand the surface processes and environmental conditions of the area.",

                    "Answer": "The need for rigorous data quality control and processing in meteorological data collection within wetland environments arises from factors such as the potential for data loss or errors due to harsh environmental conditions, sensor malfunctions, and the necessity to remove data that is physically implausible or exceeds instrument ranges. Ensuring consistent data intervals and marking doubtful data segments with identifiers like -6999 for missing data are crucial for maintaining data integrity and reliability.",

                    "Answer": "Implementing comprehensive observation networks in wetland areas is crucial for accurately capturing meteorological data due to the unique environmental characteristics of these regions. Such networks enable the collection of diverse data points, including air temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and soil temperature, which are essential for understanding local climate dynamics, ecosystem processes, and potential impacts of climate change. This integrated approach helps in assessing the wetland's role in regional hydrology and supports environmental management and conservation efforts.",

                    "Answer": "An automatic weather station can be set up in a wetland area by installing various sensors such as air temperature and humidity sensors at different heights, a barometer, a tipping bucket rain gauge, anemometers, wind vanes, radiation sensors, infrared thermometers, soil temperature probes, soil heat flux plates, and quantum sensors for photosynthetically active radiation. These instruments need to be positioned correctly, calibrated, and oriented as specified, such as facing true north or south. Data processing involves ensuring data quality by marking missing data, removing duplicates, deleting data beyond physical or instrumental ranges, and highlighting questionable data to maintain accuracy and reliability.",
