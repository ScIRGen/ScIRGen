            "description": "In the Tibetan Plateau, rice is concentrated in Chayu and Motuo counties on the southern slope of the Himalayas in the southeast of Tibet. The perennial rice planting area in Qaru County is about 5000-6000 mu, accounting for about 70% of the total rice area in the autonomous region and about 75% of the total rice output in the autonomous region. The rice production in Qaru County has obvious plateau characteristics. The alpine farming area in Tibet refers to the alpine lake basin and shallow valley belt upstream of rivers with high altitude and cold climate, but crop production can still be carried out. As the terrain is high and the temperature is low all year round, the development of agriculture is limited by heat, so it forms a unique agricultural zone. The alpine farming area is followed by the valley farming area at lower altitude, and even the natural grassland and pure animal husbandry area at higher altitude. It is a semi-agricultural and semi-animal husbandry economic type that takes up a considerable proportion of both agricultural area and animal husbandry, and transitions from agricultural area to pastoral area. It is also the upper limit area of plateau crop distribution. This type of production area divided by altitudinal belt is widely distributed in The Tibetan plateau. More than 80% of its cultivated area is concentrated in the long and narrow alpine lake basin belt of southern Tibet at the northern foot of the Central Himalayas. In northwest and northeast Tibet, the Gangdisi Mountains, Nyenqing Tanggula Mountains, the lower valley of the high mountain belt on the south side of Tanggula Mountains and the valley of Ali Plateau also have certain cultivated land distribution.",
            "descriptionCn": "在西藏高原，水稻集中分布在藏东南喜马拉雅山南坡的察隅、墨脱两县。察隅县常年水稻种植面积约5000-6000亩，占全自治区水稻面积的70%左右，产量占全自治区水稻总产量的75%左右。察隅县的水稻生产具有明显的高原特色，现对该县的水稻生产情况与增产途径分述于后。西藏的高寒农区指海拔很高，气候冷凉，但仍能进行作物生产的高山湖盆和河流上游的浅谷地带。由于地势高亢，常年气温低，发展农业受到热量的限制比较突出，因此形成一个独特的农业地带。高寒农区下接海拔较低的河谷农区，上连海拔更高的天然草场和纯牧业地区，是一个农区、牧业都占有相当比例，由农区向牧区过渡的半农半牧经济类型。亦是高原作物分布的上限地区。这种按海拔垂直带划分的生产地域类型，在西藏高原分布很广。其耕地面积的80%以上集中分布在中喜马拉雅山北麓狭长的藏南高山湖盆地带。藏西北、藏东北等冈底斯山、念青唐古拉山、唐古拉山南侧的高山带下层河谷以及阿里高原河谷地区，也都有一定的耕地分布。",
