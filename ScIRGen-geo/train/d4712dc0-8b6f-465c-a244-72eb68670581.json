In this context, the system uses sensors placed at different heights to capture detailed meteorological data.",

This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between atmospheric and soil processes compared to single-level sensor setups, which may only provide surface or point measurements and miss vertical variability critical in ecological hydrology studies.",
