            "description": "The Qingmuguan watershed, located at the junction of Beibei, Shapingba and Bishan districts in Chongqing, is an observation watershed of the National Field Scientific Observatory of Karst Ecosystem in Jinfoshan, Chongqing. The Qingmuguan Precipitation Observation Dataset integrates rainfall time series from eight rainfall stations in the basin. The observation stations use the ECH2O observation system developed by Meter, Inc. of the United States, together with the Em50 data collector and ECRN-100 tipping bucket rain gauge to realize automatic monitoring. The observation network was completed in December 2019 with a sampling interval of 15 min. rain gauges were erected at a height of about 2 m above the ground. This dataset organizes the data between 2020 and 2022 stored in Excel format.",
            "instructions": "Data files are named as \"QMG_prec_Sxx. xlsx\", in which \"xx\" denotes the station ID. Within each file, the sampling time (UTC+8) and 15-min accumulated precipitaiton are column-wisely stored, and missing values are filled with -99. The spreadsheet \"QMG_prec_station_info.xlsx\" contains latitude and longitude information for all stations. Microsoft Office Excel can be used to retrieve the data.",
