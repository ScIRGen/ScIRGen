            "description": "The identification of sand grains under polarized-light microscopy is an important and fundamental task in geological research. The accurate identification of sand grain types and the rapid acquisition of their content can provide important information on physical origin, tectonics, regional erosion, paleoclimate and paleoenvironment. Previously, the identification of sand grains required manual observation, which required specialist geological knowledge and a huge amount of work, and therefore had problems such as low accuracy, time consuming and subjective factors. In particular, there are still many challenges in working with microscopic image-based heavy mineral identification systems. For example, previous methods generally required manual feature extraction, which relied on the expert's knowledge of the geological field, and the feature extraction process was time-consuming and labour-intensive, making it a challenge to effectively automate feature extraction. The use of only orthogonal polarised images or only single polarised images cannot adequately capture the important features of heavy minerals and therefore cannot effectively differentiate between heavy mineral classes. Thirdly, previous methods generally default to the training and test sets having the same data distribution (i.e. independent homogeneous distribution), but in practice, microscopic images of heavy minerals often carry information from many source areas, which may not be related to the heavy mineral class, but are highly dependent on the sample acquisition source area and the imaging environment, which is reflected in the final image. The imaging environment is reflected in the fact that the quality of the final image can be affected by the production and filming habits of different staff, as well as the use of different microscopes, different camera systems and other instruments, which results in inconsistent data distribution between the training and test sets from different fields of origin, and it is also a challenge to train a recognition model with better generalisation. To address the above three challenges, this research proposes a new deep neural network-based heavy mineral recognition model: twin adversarial networks, with a primary focus on higher recognition accuracy and better generalisation to samples from new domains (emerging source regions or imaging environments).\nAs there is little research on automatic heavy mineral identification and a lack of published available heavy mineral identification datasets, it is particularly important to photograph and produce a dataset that can be used for heavy mineral identification from microscopic images in order to explore the feasibility of microscopic image-based heavy mineral identification.\nThe samples of dataset is collected from the Yarlung Zangbo River (16A063, N29°19′13.5 ″, E88°51′28.4″, Congsong in Xigaze)，the Pengqu River (16B027, N28 ° 09 ′ 35.96 ″, E87 ° 20 ′ 45.87 ″, Qudang in Tingri), the Yangtze River (16A001, N 32°10′0.02″, E118°58′ 41.61″; Qixia mountain in Nanjing). The 3546 polarized photomicrographs of 1773 grains were collected by polarized microscope Nikon LD1000 in the School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University. The dataset contains 12 kinds of heavy minerals, namely amphibole，apatite，biotite，epidote，garnet, monazite, muscovite, pyroxene, rutile, spinel, tourmaline, and zircon.\nBased on three datasets of heavy mineral particle microscopy images from the Yarlung Tsangpo, Pengqu and Yangtze rivers, the samples can be stratified and sampled in a 7:3 ratio for each basin in a hybrid domain setting, and randomly divided into training and test sets. Training of classification algorithm models such as SVM, DT, RF, KNN, CART, VGG-16, ResNet34, SAN and automatic mineral identification tests were carried out on these datasets. A comprehensive comparison of all methods showed that deep learning methods significantly outperformed all traditional methods, while the new twin adversarial network scheme proposed in this study achieved the best overall results (84% accuracy, more than 10% higher than other traditional methods). The current study demonstrates that by effectively fusing the features of both polarised images through the structure of the twin network and removing domain-related information from the feature representation through adversarial training, the final model can effectively reduce the negative impact of domain characteristics on the recognition results, thus allowing for a model with better generalisation performance to unknown domains. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness of twin adversarial networks and their generalisation to unknown domains.\nThis dataset is one of the foundations for the automated identification and statistical development of heavy minerals, and our initial exploration not only demonstrates the value of this dataset, but also provide important lessons for future automated identification and machine learning of heavy minerals.\nThe paper related to this dataset has been published in: Huizhen Hao, Zhiwei Jiang, Shiping Ge, Cong Wang, Qing Gu, 2022, Siamese Adversarial Network for Image Classification of Heavy Mineral Grains.
