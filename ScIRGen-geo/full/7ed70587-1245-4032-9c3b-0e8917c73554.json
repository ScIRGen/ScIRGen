            "description": "In the growing season of 2012, four typical shrub communities observed precipitation stem stream and penetrating rainfall during the experiment period.Data content: test date;Stem flow rate;Penetration rainfall, interception.\nMethod of observation: water penetration was measured using a circular iron vessel with a diameter of 15 cm and a height of 10 cm.Since jinrumei, seabuckthorn and jinjijicinus shrub could not be observed on a single plant, after the canopy canopy density of the sample plots was determined, 9 water receivers were placed in each sample plot, so that there were water receivers under different canopy closures.This method of observing rain penetration allows for better collection of rain penetration from different parts of the underbrush.Due to the difficulty of observation and the lack of herbaceous vegetation, the interception of herbaceous under shrub was neglected.Takashima is centered on the stem, which is near the stem. One is placed at the edge of the crown and one at the middle of the crown and spoke. The Angle between each 3 containers is 120Â°.Six of each shrub were selected for stem flow observation.A single shrub was measured on the lower stems of all branches, and the stem flow of the trunk of the cluster shrub was measured by standard branch method, that is, the basal diameter of each branch of the selected shrub was measured.Under brush all branch stem, the use of polyethylene plastic hose cut open, card on the thickets stems directly, with a plastic adhesive tape and glass, the plastic tube directly connected to the trunk stem flow collection bottle, bottle thickness and plastic pipe, avoid rain and penetrate the rain into the collection bottle, before use after artificial experiments can precisely collect trunk stem flow.In order to reduce the error caused by evaporation in the measurement process, the penetrating rainfall and the flow of the trunk and stem were measured in time after the rain, such as the rain at night, and the samples were taken early in the morning on the second day.\nData processing: the penetration rainfall is multiplied by 1.78 (conversion coefficient of different diameters of 20 cm and 15 cm) and replaced by the corresponding penetration rainfall (mm) at standard 20 cm.The measured water volume of each trunk flow collection bottle was divided by the projection area of the standard branch to obtain the trunk flow rate of the branch. The trunk flow rate of the standard branch was multiplied by the number of branches of the whole shrub to obtain the trunk flow rate of the whole shrub.According to the principle of water balance, the redistribution process of rainfall by shrub can be divided into three parts: interception, trunk flow and penetrating rainfall:\nIC = P - SF - TF\nWhere, P is the rainfall outside the forest;TF is the penetrating rainfall;SF is the flow rate of the trunk.IC is the interception amount of the irrigation layer.According to the measured data of the stem flow through the rain trunk, the interception was obtained by using the above equation.",

                    "Answer": "Stemflow refers to the portion of precipitation that travels down the stem of a plant to the soil. In the context of precipitation interception by shrub communities, stemflow is measured by selecting representative branches and using polyethylene plastic tubing to direct water to collection bottles. This process is integral to understanding how shrubs redistribute rainfall, as it quantifies the water that flows down the stems, contributing to the overall water balance, which is calculated using the formula IC=P-SF-TF, where IC is canopy interception, P is external rainfall, SF is stemflow, and TF is throughfall.",

                    "Answer": "Using circular iron containers allows for the collection of throughfall data under varying canopy closures by placing multiple containers within the sample area. This method provides a way to capture the spatial variability of throughfall across different sections of the canopy, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of how different canopy densities impact water distribution. By placing containers strategically beneath the canopy, researchers can assess the reliability of this method in capturing differential water flow and its potential limitations in terms of spatial coverage and container placement.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in accurately measuring stemflow and throughfall in shrubby ecosystems arise from several factors. Firstly, the difficulty in observing individual shrubs such as Potentilla fruticosa, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Caragana korshinskii due to their complex canopy structures leads to reliance on canopy closure measurements and multiple collectors under different canopy areas. Secondly, the lack of herbaceous vegetation under shrubs means that its interception is neglected, potentially affecting the accuracy of throughfall measurements. Additionally, the need for precision in collecting stemflow using polyethylene tubes and ensuring no external water enters the collection bottles requires careful setup and maintenance. The timely measurement post-rainfall is crucial to reduce errors from evaporation, especially for overnight rainfalls. Moreover, varying container sizes necessitate conversion factors to standardize measurements, which could introduce additional errors.",

                    "Answer": "Using different crown densities for capturing throughfall data beneath shrub canopies allows for a more precise collection of data, as it ensures that the variation in canopy closure is accounted for. This method likely improves the accuracy of the throughfall measurements by providing a more comprehensive assessment of how rain penetrates different sections of the canopy. The use of multiple collectors ensures that data reflects the heterogeneity of the canopy structure.",

                    "Answer": "To measure stem flow and throughfall in shrub communities, polyethylene plastic tubing is used, cut open and attached directly to the shrub stems, then sealed with plastic tape and silicone sealant to ensure accurate collection of stem flow. Each stem flow collection bottle is connected to this tubing. For throughfall, circular iron containers with a diameter of 15 cm and a height of 10 cm are placed under different canopy densities, with nine collectors per site to capture varying throughfall patterns. Challenges include the difficulty of measuring individual shrubs like Potentilla fruticosa, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Caragana korshinskii due to their bushy nature, necessitating estimation based on average basal diameter. Additionally, evaporation errors are minimized by timely measurements post-rainfall, and the calculation of throughfall involves converting collected rain using a conversion factor for standardization.",
