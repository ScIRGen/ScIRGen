            "titleEn": "Energy consumption and carbon emissions  dataset from global irrigation (2000-2010)",
            "description": "This dataset represents the first comprehensive dataset covering global irrigation water energy consumption and carbon emissions, with a spatial resolution of 0.083° and a temporal span from 2000 to 2010.  The dataset includes total energy consumption for irrigation water, total energy-related carbon emissions, energy consumption and carbon emissions implicit in different irrigation water sources (surface water and groundwater), pumping systems (diesel pumps and electric pumps), irrigation systems (drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and surface irrigation), as well as irrigation energy consumption and carbon emissions under future 3°C sustainable irrigation expansion scenarios.  This dataset is generated using a 'bottom-up' approach based on physical processes, considering factors such as irrigation water withdrawal, irrigation water sources, groundwater drawdown effects, irrigation systems, pumping systems, regional electricity carbon emission intensity, and electricity trade.  Most input parameters have been calibrated and validated using ground observation data.  Additionally, the estimation results have been compared and verified against regional statistical reports, ensuring reliability.  This dataset fills the gap in energy consumption and carbon emissions in agricultural systems, enabling the identification of regions where future energy supply may constrain irrigation expansion, assessment of the pressure of irrigation on regional energy supply systems, analysis of the impact of carbon tax policies on irrigation agriculture, and assessment of agricultural input-output benefits.  Furthermore, it will promote research related to climate-smart agriculture and energy-saving and emission-reduction in agricultural systems.",
            "instructions": "The naming convention for data is as follows: data content+data component+unit, such as Carbon-Diesel-Tonnes, where Carbon represents the CO2 emissions generated by irrigation energy consumption, Diesel represents the CO2 emissions hidden in diesel pumping systems, and Tonnes represents the unit in tons; Energy.Electric-Terajoule, Energy represents irrigation energy consumption, Electric represents energy consumption implicit in electric pumping systems, and Terajoule represents units in terajoules. The data is stored in GeoTIFF format and can be read using software such as ArcGIS and QGIS.",

The dataset enables the examination of how different irrigation water sources, pumping systems, and irrigation methods contribute to energy usage and emissions over time. This can help identify regional differences and potential areas where energy-efficient practices could be implemented. Additionally, it allows for the assessment of the impact of future climate scenarios, such as a 3°C warming, on irrigation energy demands and emissions.",
