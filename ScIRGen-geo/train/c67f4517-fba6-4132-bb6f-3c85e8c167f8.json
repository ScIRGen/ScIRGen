The data was obtained by mosaicing and extracting the From-GLC data. Several land cover types, such as snow and ice that do not exist in Southeast Asia were eliminated.The legend were reintegrated to match the new data. The data provide information of 8 land cover types: cropland, forest, grassland, shrub, wetland, water, city and bare land. The overall accuracy of the data is 71% (Gong et al., 2019). The data can provide the land cover information of Southeast Asia for hydrological models and regional climate models.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of spatial datasets for regional analysis, 'land cover type' refers to the classification of the Earth's surface into various categories based on observed physical and biological cover, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, or water bodies. This classification helps in understanding the distribution of different types of land surfaces and is crucial for applications like hydrological modeling and regional climate modeling. The land cover type data is often derived from satellite imagery and involves processes such as image stitching and cropping to create a comprehensive dataset for a specific region.",

                    "Answer": "Using land cover data with a 30-meter spatial resolution can provide detailed surface type information, which may enhance the accuracy of hydrological models by better representing the spatial variability of surface types like cropland, forest, and wetlands. This detailed representation can improve the model's ability to simulate water flow, storage, and exchange processes across different land cover types. However, it might also introduce challenges if the data's accuracy is only 71%, potentially leading to errors in areas where land cover types are misclassified or where finer resolution is necessary.",

The dataset aims to give accurate representation of Southeast Asia's land surface for these applications by processing data from the FROM-GLC source and ensuring it is relevant by excluding certain land cover types like snow and ice, which are not present in the region.",

The land cover types are then re-encoded to produce a dataset that includes eight surface types: cropland, forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, water bodies, impervious surfaces, and bare land.",
