                "It is widely accepted that the majority of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau are now retreating and thinning, although spatially systematic differences in glacier status are apparent and the exact mass loss remains controversial. Glacial retreat on the Tibetan Plateau not only affects water resources, runoff regimes, and hydrological processes in the region but also causes the formation and development of glacial lakes on/beneath/in front of mother glaciers. Such glacial lakes can be storehouses of fresh water, but they are also hazardous to humans and infrastructure as they can suddenly drain and cause devastating glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) downstream. A number of GLOFs have occurred on the Tibetan Plateau in the last several decades, and the majority have been concentrated in the Himalayas and the region south-east of the Tibetan Plateau. Previous GLOF events have demonstrated that glacial lakes are a potential threat to people living downstream because of their suddenness and the large land area that is affected. Rapid glacier retreat and intense rainfall in the monsoon season make this area one of the most GLOF-affected regions of the Tibetan Plateau. With global warming and glacial retreat, the frequency of GLOFs appears to have increased in recent years, and GLOF hazards in the Poiqu River basin are envisaged to increase significantly in the near future."

By analysing multiple phases of glacial lake inventories, we also investigate the distribution and development of glacial lakes in the Poiqu River basin from 1976 to 2010, with a special focus on the last decade. Our results are then linked to climate change and glacier fluctuations, to demonstrate how climate and glacier activity affect the status of glacial lakes."

Only the Landsat images acquired from late August to early December were chosen to avoid the high cloud obscuration during the monsoon season and ensure minimal snow coverage. For each phase of the glacial lake inventory, several images acquired on consecutive dates were used to ensure the reliable delineation of the glacial lakes’ boundaries. A 25-m digital elevation model (DEM) produced by the National Geomatics Center of China was also used in this study to derive the elevation of glacial lakes and to delineate watersheds for each of the lakes. Glacial lakes and their mother glaciers were manually identified and digitized on the basis of false-colour composite Landsat images. For the new inventory of glacial lakes in 2010, lakes larger than 0.01 km2 were digitized and catalogued according to specific attributes."
