This can inform regional planning by identifying areas that have undergone significant change, thus aiding in the development of sustainable strategies. For environmental monitoring, these datasets can help establish baselines for detecting changes in agriculture, forestry, water resources, soil conditions, and geological features, offering a comprehensive understanding of how these factors have evolved. However, challenges such as the lower resolution of historical data and potential data gaps may affect the precision of analyses and conclusions drawn.",

The data is organized into folders named by the row and column number of the images, containing images of the four MSS bands in TIFF format, along with metadata and header files in .met and .hdr formats and thumbnails in jpg format. The images are resampled using cubic convolution and are formatted in GeoTIFF with a pixel size of 60m. The map projection used is UTM – WGS 84, with map orientation set to North Up.",
