            "description": "This dataset includes capacity factors (cf) for PV and wind power generation under various scenarios on the Tibetan Plateau and after considering land constraints. Three installation scenarios of PV panels are considered for PV power generation, namely: optimal tilt, single-axis rotation and dual-axis rotation. Four height scenarios for wind energy generation were considered for turbines: 80 m, 100 m, 120 m and 140 m. The dataset can be used for solar and wind energy planning, siting, potential estimation and investment economics assessment. The dataset is based on solar radiation and wind speed data with higher accuracy and resolution and photovoltaic and wind power conversion models. The dataset will be useful for future applications of photovoltaic and wind power generation on the Tibetan Plateau.",
