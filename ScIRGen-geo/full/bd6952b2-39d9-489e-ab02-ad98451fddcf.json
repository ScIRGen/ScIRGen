            "description": "The data involved geodetic glacier mass change of 71pieces of glaciers during 2000-2014 in the east of the Yigongzangbu, Southeast Tibetan Plateau. It is stored in the ESRI vector polygon format.Glacier-averaged mass balance (m w.e.a-1) was calculated by the surface elevation difference between 2000-2014 ( Dh2000-2014)、glacier coveraged vector data (CGI2/TPG1976/RGI6.0) and ice density of 850 ± 60 kg m−3. Dh2000-2014 is obtained from surface elevation change by D-InSAR technique from a pair of TSX / TDx SAR images on February 7, 2014 and SRTM DEM. CGI2/TPG1976/RGI6.0 were used to extract glacier boundary and GLIMS-ID. SRTM DEM is the reference DEM and datum DEM with spatial resolution 30m. The attribute data includes GLIMS-ID, Area,EC_m_a-1,,MB_m w.e.a-1, MC_m3 w.e.a-1, MC_Gt.a-1, Uncerty_EC, Uncerty_MB, UT_MCm3w.e. a-1. Respectively, EC_m_a-1,,is the glacier-averaged annual elevation change during 2000-2014(m a-1),MB_m w.e.a-1, is glacier-averaged annual mass balance during 2000-2014(m w.e.a-1), MC_m3 w.e.a-1, is glacier-averaged annual mass change during 2000-2014 (m3 w.e.a-1), MC_Gt.a-1,is glacier-averaged annual mass change during 2000-2014 (Gt.a-1)Uncerty_EC is the uncertainty of glacier surface elevation change（±m a-1）、Uncerty_MB ,is the uncertainty of glacier mass balance（±m w.e. a-1），UT_MCm3w.e. a-1, is the uncertainty of glacier mass change（±m3w.e. a-1）。The data sets could be used for glacier change, hydrological and climate change studies in the southeast of Tibetan Plateau.",

                "It is well known that glaciers in mountains are retreating widely in a warmer climate during recent decades on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The runoffs from both glaciers and glacier lakes have been increased significantly, and the potential outbursts of glacier lakes have threatened the residence safety in China and the adjacent countries. However, most of the glaciers locate in very distant mountains. As glaciers are difficult to be investigated due to the huge investments and long traveling time of field surveys, remote sensing monitoring has been the major approach adopted to understand the changes of glaciers nowadays. Mountain glaciers, especially those in temperate regions, are considered one of the best natural indicators of climate change. In recent years, the contribution of glaciers to the rise in lake and sea levels has also received increasing attention, with global glacier melting contributing 29±13% to sea level rise, and global glaciers and ice caps contributing 61±19% to sea level rise. The Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent mountain regions have developed glaciers covering an area of about 50,000 km², which is the largest glacier area in the mid-low latitude region outside the polar regions, and is the source of many famous rivers in Asia, as well as a precious water resource in the arid inland areas. Glacier activity is an important factor inducing glacier debris flow, ice/snow avalanches, and glacier lake outburst floods, with glacier floods often being one of the most impactful glacier disasters. For example, glacier melting leads to the formation and expansion of moraine lakes, and glacier flood disasters caused by moraine or ice-dammed lakes frequently occur, posing catastrophic threats to the safety of life and property in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan regions, affecting countries like China, India, and Nepal. Therefore, with the deepening of global change research, studies on glacier changes (including area, thickness, and ice reserves) are becoming increasingly important, with significant implications for global water resources and climate change, as well as disaster warning."
