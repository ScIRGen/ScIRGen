The data are of good quality and can be used for the study of the early formation and evolution of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and the paleogeographic reconstruction of the Precambrian supercontinent. The main analytical instruments used include: Zircon U-Pb age is obtained by laser ablation – inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and zircon Hf isotope is obtained by a NWR 213nm laser ablation microprobe attached to a multicollector ICP – MS (Neptune plus), The major and trace elements in the whole rock were obtained by X-ray fluorescence Shimadzu (xrf-1800) and analyticjena pqms elite ICP – Ms.",

On the other hand, X-ray fluorescence and ICP-MS are employed for determining the whole rock major and trace elements, offering comprehensive compositional data that complements the chronological information. Both methods are crucial, but they serve different purposes: LA-ICP-MS focuses on dating, while X-ray fluorescence and ICP-MS provide compositional insights.",
