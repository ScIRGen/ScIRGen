            "description": "This dataset includes contents, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonates in the Qom section, Central Iran. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from carbonates are important climatic proxies in paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The sediment samples were grounded and sieved through a 100 mesh screen, and then directly analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (MAT-252) with an automated carbonate preparation device (Kiel Ⅱ). C, O isotope ratios are converted to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB) standards. Typical analytical errors for C, O isotope are within ±0.1‰ (±0.06‰ and ±0.08‰ for carbon isotope and oxygen isotope, respectively). The carbonate content was measured by neutralization titration with an accuracy of 0.5%. The ages of the data were obtained by linear interpolation based on magnetostratigraphy. Based on the carbonate concentrations and the stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of the Qom Basin the Miocene paleoenvironmental evolution history can be well reconstructed, being useful for discussing the environmental effects of the uplift of the Arabia-Eurasia collision and the global climatic changes. This study aims to analyze the history of climate change in central Iran since the mid-late Miocene, and finally reveals the intensification of aridity in central Iran since 13 Ma.",

                    "Answer": "Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis in the context of studying carbonate samples from geological formations refers to the examination of the ratios of carbon and oxygen isotopes present in carbonate materials. These isotopic ratios are analyzed using isotopic mass spectrometry and are typically compared against a standard such as the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB) standard. This analysis provides insights into past environmental conditions, such as changes in aridity during geological periods, by recording dry and wet variations over time. The precision of the isotope analysis is noted to be ±0.1‰ for both carbon and oxygen isotopes, with specific accuracy levels for carbon (better than ±0.06‰) and oxygen (better than ±0.08‰) isotopes.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios can reveal changes in moisture levels and arid conditions over geological periods. In the context of the Middle to Late Miocene strata, such data help reconstruct the central Iranian Plateau's aridification history and provide insights into regional responses to tectonic activities like the collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates, as well as global climate change.",

The isotopic ratios are standardized to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB) standard, with high analytical precision, allowing for reliable reconstruction of the Miocene aridification history in the region.",
