Within CMIP6, the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) aims to generate multi-model climate projections for alternate scenarios of future emissions and land-use changes produced with integrated assessment models. The US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project is a new and ongoing climate modeling effort to develop a state-of-the-art Earth system model. The E3SM project aims to develop code optimized for DOE’s high-performance computing infrastructure and to advance Earth system prediction of changes in environmental variables that are critical to energy-sector decisions, such as regional trends in air and water temperatures, water availability, storms and heavy precipitation, coastal flooding, and sea-level rise (Bader et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020). E3SM version 1.0 (E3SMv1.0) at the standard horizontal resolution of ∼100 km reported a high ECS of 5.3 K, a high transient climate response (TCR) of 2.93 K, along with a strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFaero) of −1.65 W m−2 (Golaz et al., 2019). Previous estimates found that the net positive cloud feedback of 0.94 W m−2 K−1 in E3SMv1.0 is too strong compared with other CMIP6 models at the range of 0.42 ±0.36 W m−2 K−1 (Zelinka et al., 2020, Table S1)."

Secondly, we describe regional responses of key climate components in the GHG-only simulations. The difference between the high-emission all-forcing experiment and the GHG-only experiment is analyzed."

The GHG-only future projection simulations (future_Pn-SSP5-8.5-GHG) use the end of the historical_Hn simulations as the starting points and use the GHG forcing in the SSP5-8.5 scenario, while the other forcings are still set at the same pre-industrial values as historical_Hn-GHG."

The global mean precipitation in E3SMv1.0 increases by >0.3 mm d−1 from the end of the historical period (year 2014) to the end of the future projection (year 2099). The global mean Tair changes in the E3SMv1.0 ensemble members are comparable to the CMIP6 models with the highest warming. The global pattern of Tair change between 2070–2099 and 1985–2014 reveals a polar amplification of surface warming and interhemispheric asymmetric warming. The global mean precipitation increases by ∼10 % due to the warmer climate."

This limitation can challenge the robustness of climate projections as it may not fully capture variability or uncertainty across different possible future scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "Higher ECS and TCR values in certain climate models, such as E3SMv1.0, might be due to overly strong feedback processes like net positive cloud feedback. This affects the interpretation of dataset results as it may lead to projections of warmer temperature anomalies and greater precipitation increases, raising questions about the model's representation of feedback mechanisms compared to other models.",

                    "Answer": "Isolating the impact of GHG forcings can be challenging due to the complex interactions between different climate variables and the influence of natural variability. In the E3SM model's GHG-only simulations, all other forcings are held at pre-industrial levels to isolate the effects of GHGs. However, such an approach may overlook the synergistic effects of other forcings and their interaction with GHGs, which could lead to an incomplete understanding of the climate system's response.",

The E3SM model, for instance, provides high-emission scenario data that can be useful for understanding extreme climate outcomes, but researchers must be cautious about the model's equilibrium climate sensitivity and aerosol-related forcing effects. Additionally, the dataset's ability to capture regional variability and specific climate phenomena, such as polar amplification, should be evaluated.",

One approach to overcoming these challenges is to standardize data formats and protocols, such as those used in the GEWEX/GASS/LS4P protocol, which can help streamline data integration and comparison. Additionally, employing high-performance computing infrastructure can aid in handling large datasets efficiently.",

                    "Answer": "In climate models, high-emission all-forcing experiments include all anthropogenic and natural forcings, while GHG-only simulations isolate the impact of greenhouse gases by holding other forcings at pre-industrial values. This differentiation allows researchers to understand the specific contributions of greenhouse gases to climate change. The setup involves conducting ensemble simulations with the same model settings across both experiment types, using historical data as a baseline and future projections for scenario analysis.",

These datasets can provide real-world validation and calibration points for model outputs. Additionally, incorporating datasets from other CMIP6 models can help compare and contrast climate sensitivity across different modeling approaches, enhancing the understanding of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR) projections.",
