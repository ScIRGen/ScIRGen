The glacial elevation changes in the High Mountain Asia region were calculated using ICESat-1 data (2003-2008) and SRTM DEM data in 2000, taking into account the inhomogeneity of glacier changes and area distribution at different elevations and slopes (weighted average of glacier area of elevation and slope bins in 1°×1° grid ). The dataset can provide the annual change information of glacier elevation in the High Mountain Asia region from 2003 to 2008 relative to 2000. These data can be used for studies of climate change in the High Mountain Asia.",

In the data, “lon” represents longitude, “lat” represents latitude, and “GEC” represents the glacier elevation change.",

                "Glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change and have a significant influence on regional water cycle, human survival and social development. Global warming has led to great changes in glaciers over the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region. Glacier elevation change is a measure of glacier mass balance driven by the processes of energy and mass exchange between the glacier surface and the atmosphere which are influenced by climatic factors and glacier surface properties. High Mountain Asia (HMA) is the region with the largest distribution of glaciers and diverse glacier types in the middle latitudes of the earth. It is the birthplace of major rivers in Asia, such as the Amu Darya River, the Syr Darya River, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Salween River, the Brahmaputra River and the Indus River. To date, the glaciers in the HMA region have undergone significant changes, triggering a series of disasters and having a major impact on people’s production and lives. The glacier changes not only directly drive changes in the natural environment in the HMA region, but also have feedbacks to climate change in the whole northern hemisphere and even the whole world. Existing studies have shown that the glaciers in the HMA are generally in a melting state, but the rate of change varies in different regions and different time spans. Lidar altimetry data, such as ICESat-1&2 data, have higher vertical accuracy than satellite-based stereo image pair data. The HMA is located in the intersection of various climates. The south of HMA is mainly affected by the Indian monsoon, the west and northwest of HMA are mainly affected by the westerly wind, the east is mainly affected by the East Asian monsoon, and the central region is mainly affected by the continental climate. The HMA is sensitive to climate change. Previous studies have shown that a 1.5 °C increase in global temperature will lead to a 2.1 °C increase in the temperature in the Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, glacier change is an important indicator of global warming, and it is of great significance to explore the changes in the HMA glacier and its relationship with the climate variations."

                "Many studies on glacier elevation changes in the HMA region have focused on the inter-annual variability, and studies on monthly/seasonal changes in glacier elevation are still lacking. Although many studies have estimated the intra-annual loss of glaciers, most studies infer monthly/seasonal glacier elevation changes based on relationships with precipitation rather than directly extracting glacier elevation information from satellites observations. In short, none of the existing studies have analyzed glacier elevation changes on a monthly/seasonal scale. The lack of existing observations and effective monitoring methods has limited researchers to accurately analyze the intra-annual variation of glacier elevation."

The GLAS onboard ICESat-1 satellite emits 40 Hz laser pulses vertically along the orbit and estimates the surface elevation from the round-trip time of the laser pulses. ICESat-2 uses ATLAS to monitor the elevation information of the earth’s surface. The data points observed by ATLAS in 2020 can occupy about 30,000 glaciers in the HMA region, which is about nine times as many as all data points observed by GLAS in 2003–2008. In this study, the ICESat-2 ATL06 data were used, including elevation, time, latitude, longitude, confidence parameters, etc. SRTM uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology to collect the earth’s surface elevation data. In this study, the SRTM DEM from C-SAR data were used as the reference elevation to obtain the glacier surface elevation information of the HMA in 2000."
