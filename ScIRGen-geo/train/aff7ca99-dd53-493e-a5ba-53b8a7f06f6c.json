Digital automatic data acquisition. The temperature and relative humidity instrument probe is hmp155a; The wind speed sensor is 05103; The precipitation is te525mm; The radiation is li200x;\n3) Data quality description; The original data of air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed are the average value of 10 minutes, and the precipitation is the cumulative value of 10 minutes; The daily average temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and wind speed are obtained by arithmetic average or summation. Due to the limitation of the sensor, the precipitation in winter may have a certain error.\n4) Data application achievements and prospects: this data is the update of the existing data \"Sejila Mountain meteorological data (2007-2017)\" and \"basic meteorological data of Sejila east slope forest line of South Tibet station of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2018)\". The data time scale span is large, which is convenient for scientists or graduate students in Atmospheric Physics, ecology and atmospheric environment. This data will be updated from time to time every year.",
