            "description": "This dataset includes both measured and simulated surface oxygen concentration data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Among them, the measured data were based on field measurements, including the oxygen concentration data of 807 measurement points on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2017 to 2022 and the corresponding geographical environment data such as latitude, longitude, elevation, temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, FVC, geomorphologic type, and vegetation type. The simulated data were based on model simulations, including the annual average, July average, January average oxygen concentration distribution data, and the difference between the July average and January average, with the spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and the unit of data in %. Through cross-validation analysis, the surface oxygen concentration simulation model of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is robust and the accuracy of the simulation data is high. This dataset filled the gaps in the measurement and research of oxygen concentrations on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, while providing data support for analyses of the influencing factors and spatiotemporal characteristics of oxygen concentrations, which is of great significance for promoting the construction of ecological civilization in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.",

                "Oxygen (O2) is the most abundant molecule in the atmosphere after nitrogen. Previous studies have documented that oxygen concentration remains nearly constant (20.946%) at all altitudes. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau lies between 26°00′ –39°47′N, 73°19′–104°47′E, covers an area of ~ 2.5 × 106 km2, with an average altitude exceeding 4500 m. Also known as the “Roof of the World”, the climate on the QTP is characterized by a typical cold and dry alpine climate, with an average annual temperature from −3.1 to 4.4 °C and an average annual precipitation from 103 to 694 mm, which both decreases from east to west. One of the key features that enable our planet Earth to house an active and diverse biology is the presence of free molecular oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere. In the long history of Geological time scale, near-surface oxygen concentration has changed drastically and induced critical impacts on the biogeochemical processes of the earth surface, and the evolution of life. However, for the past century, oxygen concentration has been regarded as nearly constant since the first result presented by Benedict (1912). Machta and Hughes collected observations of atmospheric oxygen between 50°N and 60°S, mainly over the oceans, and suggested an almost constant O2 value of 20.946% by volume in dry air. Studies further suggest that oxygen concentration remains nearly constant, with little variations at different altitudes and within different seasons."
