            "description": "Snow density plays a crucial role in managing water resources and issuing snow avalanche warnings. Snow density exhibits great spatiotemporal dependent structure due to its spatiotemporal heteorogenity and its relations with various influencing factors, which pose challenges to mapping long-term and large-scale snow density. This leads to a scarcity of accurate snow density products. To tackle this issue, we develope a spatiotemporal random forest (STRF) model by combining ground measurements, remote sensing sources, and reanalysis data. Notably, our model shows impressive results apparently outperforming the ERA5-Land snow density dataset. Our estimated snow density can also enhance existing snow water equivalent dataset that rely on fixed snow density. Using our model, we produce a dataset of daily 25-km snow density from 1980 to 2018 for stable snow cover areas in China. This dataset holds significant potential for research and practical applications in the field of snow hydrology.",

                "Snow density is of paramount importance in water resource management, snow avalanche warning, and climate change research. Snow density serves as a pivotal parameter in the snowpack, impacting its thermal, mechanical, and optical characteristics. It plays a prominent role in substantial snow-related studies and applications, such as water resource management, snow avalanche warning, and weather and climate forecasting. Snow density exhibits morbid spatiotemporal heterogeneity, which manifests across various stages of snow evolution. However, in many snow-related studies and applications, snow density is often treated as a fixed value due to limited knowledge about its distribution, especially for snow water equivalent (SWE) estimation, which highly influences the accuracy of SWE products obtained through passive microwave remote sensing. A recent study revealed that dynamic snow density obtained by simple interpolation techniques could improve the accuracy of SWE products by 16%. Ground station observations are considered as the most convenient and accurate method for obtaining snow density, and are frequently utilized to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of snow density.",
                "Snow density is sensitive to temporal variation owing to climatic variation, and has abundant spatial variation caused by the interaction with variables, such as topography, land cover, radiation, and wind. The spatiotemporal dependent structure inherent in snow density encompasses its spatiotemporal heterogeneity and its relations with influencing factors. Snow density and its influencing factors exhibit complex relations that display spatiotemporal heterogeneity and are hardly stationary. Current approaches are limited by complexity or structural problems as well as challenges from the spatiotemporal dependent structure inherent in snow density, which leads to rare and unsatisfactory performance of snow density data.",
                "One of the critical purposes of producing dynamic snow density data is to improve SWE products with a fixed snow density. We select CSWE and GlobSnow SWE products because they have higher accuracies and spatiotemporal continuity according to the evaluations in existing studies (Jiang et al., 2022 ; Luojus et al., 2021 ). Accordingly, these two products are derived from snow depth estimation based on passive microwave remote sensing and a fixed snow density (CSWE of 0.18 g /cm3 and GlobSnow SWE of 0.24 g /cm3). Long‐term and vast‐scale snow density data are desperately needed for hydrological research and water management. However, ground measurements and remote sensing inversion are limited to large‐scale snow density mapping (Elder et al., 1998 ; Gao, Li, Zhang & Chen et al., 2022 ; Gao, Li, Zhang & Zeng et al., 2022 ; Sturm et al., 2010 ), while physical models are governed by atmospheric forcing and statistical models, which may lack some modules to exactly match the measurements (Mizukami & Perica, 2008 ). It has been agreed that the relations between snow density and covariates are weak‐correlated and vary in different time and space (López‐Moreno et al., 2013 ; Wang et al., 2023 ), posing great challenge to estimation but well overcome by STRF model.",
                "The STRF model was proposed to map long‐term and large‐scale snow density in favor of in‐situ measurements, multisource remote sensing, and reanalysis data. The superiority of STRF model comes from diverse covariates for addressing the spatiotemporal dependent structure inherent in snow density and strong learning model RF for handling nonlinear and weak‐correlated relations between snow density and its influencing factors. The embedded covariates are demonstrated to be conducive to snow density estimation, especially the snow‐related and geo‐space covariates with collective importance of 35.8% and 32.7%, emphasizing the magnitude of depicting snow evolution process and capturing spatial heterogeneity of snow density."

                "In this study, we aim to establish a spatiotemporal model capable of producing extensive and long-term snow density maps by capturing the complex relations between snow density and its various influencing factors. The main objectives are (a) to construct an RF model for estimating dynamic snow density by handling the nonlinear relations derived from snow density with its influencing factors, (b) to propose effective spatiotemporal covariates for characterizing the spatiotemporal dependent structure inherent in snow density, and (c) to derive daily snow density product from 1980 to 2018 using the proposed model to better assess the spatiotemporal patterns of snow density across China.",
                "In the future, more long‐term observation stations should be incorporated to enable the model to fully learn the temporal characteristics of snow density. Additionally, downscaling algorithms could be considered to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of snow density products, together with the utilization of stronger machine learning models, gradually improving the practicality and accuracy of snow density estimation."

This leads to a scarcity of accurate snow density products.",
                "Although the proposed STRF model presents outstanding performance, there are still uncertainties in the STRF model, mainly coming from the data source and the RF structure. Observation error and uneven distribution of stations both lead to the problem of a lack of station representation. Remote sensing and reanalysis data are usually accompanied by structural errors, that is, pressure data with an R² of only about 0.4 (He et al., 2020). Although the RF model is powerful, it has apparent deficiencies from the demand of sufficient and balanced data, as reflected in the analysis of model accuracy at different spatiotemporal scales. The number and characteristics of samples vary in areas and thus bring about different learning performances of model, that is, 8,596 samples in NIM area and 942 samples in QTP. The biggest problem of machine learning model is that it relies on existing measurements, instead of physical laws. The model may be quite different in places not covered by in‐situ sites, such as mountains with rare snow density measurements."

The accuracy of STRF snow density increases the R² from 0.034 to 0.642 compared with the ERA5-Land snow density.",
                "The optimized SWE with STRF snow density achieves the best accuracy, as the overestimation of GlobSnow SWE is obviously reduced and the R is increased from 0.21 to 0.31, the R of CSWE is increased from 0.55 to 0.64 and data are more concentrated on the 1:1 line.",

In addition, the optimization with dynamic STRF snow density improves the accuracies of CSWE and GlobSnow, increasing R from 0.55, 0.21 to 0.64, 0.31, respectively.
