Remote sensing has been widely used to obtain information on land use and land cover types. The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is the roof of the world and the water tower of Asia. It is known as the third pole of the Earth. It is an important ecological security barrier, a strategic resource reserve base, and an important area for preservation of Chinese culture. Obtaining high-precision vegetation types and distribution data is key to revealing the impact of climate change on the vegetation on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau."
