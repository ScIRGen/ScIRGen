The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018-6-10 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                "Aerodynamic roughness length (z0m) is a key factor in surface flux estimations with remote sensing algorithms and/or land surface models. Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

This sensitivity highlights the challenges and complexities in capturing representative flux measurements across varying terrain and surface conditions.",
