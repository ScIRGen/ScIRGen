            "description": "This data is the major and trace geochemical data of magnetite from Sn-Zn-In polymetallic deposits in southeastern Yunnan. The samples are classified into two types, including metasomatic magnetite and filling magnetite, the former is mostly saccular (or banded) in skarn, and the latter is vein like and coexists with metal sulfide. Samples were tested in the National Research Center for Geoanalys, the major and trace element data were obtained by ICP-AES and ICP-MS, respectively. The above data are published in the core journal Acta Petrologica Sinica, and the data are true and reliable. The data obtained can be used to explore the genesis of magnetite and further constrain the mineralization process from the aspects of material source and ore-forming fluid.",
