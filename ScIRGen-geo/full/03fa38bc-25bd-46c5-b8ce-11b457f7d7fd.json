            "description": "A comprehensive and robust dataset of tropospheric aerosol properties is important for understanding the effects of aerosol-radiation feedback on the climate system and reducing the uncertainties of climate models. The third pole of Earth (Tibetan Plateau, TP) is highly challenging to obtain long-term in situ aerosol data due to its harsh environmental conditions. Here, we provide more reliable the new vertical aerosol index (AI) parameter from the spaceborne-based Lidar (CALIOP) of CALIPSO over TP during 2007-2020 between daytime and nighttime to investigate the aerosol’s climatology. The calculated vertical AI was derived from the aerosol extinction coefficient (EC), which was rigorously quality-checked and validation, strictly quality checked, and validated for passive satellite sensors (MODIS) and ground-based LIDAR measurements. Generally, all those facts demonstrate the agreement of the AI dataset with the CALIOP and ground-based LIDAR. Besides, all the evidence shows that after removing the low-reliability aerosol target signal, the optimized data can obtain the aerosol characteristics with higher reliability. Our data set also reveals the patterns and numbers of high-altitude vertical structure characteristics of the aerosol troposphere over the TP. Our dataset will help to update and makeup the observational aerosol data in the TP. We encourage climate modeling groups to consider new analyses of the AI vertical patterns, comparing the recovered datasets, with the potential to increase our understanding of the aerosol-cloud-radiation-precipitation interaction and its climate effects.",

The “Third Pole” of Earth (Tibetan Plateau, TP) is highly challenging for obtaining long-term in situ aerosol data due to its harsh environmental conditions. The TP is known as the “Third Pole” because it has the third largest ice mass on Earth, after the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The TP, also called “Asia’s Water Tower”, provides freshwater to 40 % of the world’s population due to its vast water reserves such as glaciers, lakes, and rivers. Climate projections are simulated responses of the climate system to future emission or concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and are generally calculated using climate models. The most significant uncertainties in predicting future climate change are related to uncertainties in the distribution and properties of aerosols and clouds, their interactions, and limitations in the representation of aerosols and clouds in global climate models. The primary aerosol type over the TP is dust, which is primarily contributed by the Taklimakan Desert. However, the effect of aerosol on the atmospheric energy and water cycle remains uncertain, mainly due to the lack of a long-term and accurate vertical aerosol optical property dataset over the TP region."
