            "description": "Data description: The data sets contains the content of fungal spores and A/C ratio data from Tian’E Lake (39°14′20″N, 97°55′26″E, altitude 3012 m) in the western part of the Qilian Mountains at the northern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau over the past ~3,500 years. We have completed the fungal spores and pollen analyses of 520 sedimentary samples. We use analyses of pollen A/C ratio and Sporormiella-type coprophilous fungal spores to reconstruct changes in regional moisture and grazing intensity over the past ~3,500 years in an arid mountain-basin system. Our results provide a historical reference for understanding how ancient people adapted to the climate change in arid region with high mountains. The data is stored in Excel format.",
