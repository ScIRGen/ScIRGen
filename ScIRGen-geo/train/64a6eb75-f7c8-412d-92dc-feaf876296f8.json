Algorithm 3B43 is executed once per calendar month to produce the single, best-estimate precipitation rate and RMS precipitation-error estimate field (3B43) by combining the 3-hourly merged high-quality/IR estimates (3B42) with the monthly accumulated Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) rain gauge analysis. This dataset also combines ground-based rain gauge data to maximize the use of existing probe data, providing an optimal estimate of each grid’s precipitation for each standard observation. Taking the key nodes mainly covering Southeast Asia and the Middle East as the research area, based on the TRMM 3B43 data from 1998 to 2016, Google Earth Engine was used to clip the research area data, and finally the monthly precipitation dataset for key nodes of pan-third pole region from 1998 to 2016 was obtained. (In Minsk, Novosibirsk, and Warsaw, because the latitude is higher than 50°N, TRMM 3B43 does not have data for these  areas, so the upscaling GPM data is used.)",

From the producers' perspective, estimates of error for each independent dataset, whether from satellites or rain gauges, provide key information for combining the datasets. Errors arise from two sources. First, the various estimates depend on measurements and algorithms, each of which introduces its own set of bias and random errors. Second, the estimates contain \"sampling error\" in which a finite set of observations only samples the complete set of events. However, this study has a finite set of estimates, so there is also sampling of the measurement and algorithm errors that happen to be present in the estimated values. The random term alone is considered in this paper for several reasons. First, the random error is frequently the dominant term for the sparsely sampled datasets that Huffman et al. (1995, 1997) and many other papers treat. Second, precipitation estimation techniques usually strive to generate unbiased estimates (\"small\" b). Third, even when b is not small, its analysis is relatively well understood, for example, by computing long-term or large-area averages in which the random errors can be assumed to average out."
