            "description": "The data are isotopic dating data, zircon O isotopic data, zircon trace data, and whole rock major trace and isotopic geochemical data of the Eclogite in central Qiangtang, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The samples were collected from the Eclogite in the central Qiangtang, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Radioisotope geochronology data were obtained by analyzing zircon U-Pb isotopes with secondary ion microprobe. Zircon O isotope is obtained by secondary ion probe analysis, zircon trace is obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the whole rock main trace and isotope geochemical data are analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Through the data obtained, the formation and evolution history of regional metamorphic rocks can be defined.",
            "instructions": "All data are stored in Excel file. The file name \"UPB. XLS\" represents radioisotope data. The name of the file \"MinO\" represents the mineral O isotope element data. The file name \"mintra\" represents mineral trace element data. The name of the file \"wrmajtraiso\" represents the major, trace and isotopic geochemical data of the whole rock.",

                    "Answer": "The need for multiple analytical techniques arises from the complexity and diversity of the data required to understand the formation and evolution history of metamorphic rocks. Secondary ion probe analysis is used for isotopic dating to determine the age of zircon samples. Laser ablation coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is necessary for analyzing mineral trace elements, while X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry are employed for analyzing whole-rock major, trace, and isotopic geochemical data. Each technique offers specific strengths in measuring different elements and isotopes, thus providing a comprehensive dataset.",

Oxygen isotopes in minerals are also analyzed using SIMS. Trace elements in minerals are measured using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Whole-rock major, trace, and isotopic geochemical data are obtained using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These methods help to determine the formation and evolutionary history of regional metamorphic rocks.",
