            "description": "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the source of many major rivers in Asia, providing essential water for hundreds of millions of people, and is known as the \"Water Tower of Asia\". The main source of water recharge for the Asian Water Tower is precipitation from the Tibetan Plateau, of which the Tibetan Plateau vortex (TPV) is one of the important precipitation-producing systems on the Tibetan Plateau. Due to the complex topography of the Tibetan Plateau and the lack of observational data, there are still many gaps in the understanding of the climatic and structural characteristics of the TPVs and their formation and change mechanisms. This dataset uses multiple sets of reanalysis data and objective identification methods to obtain a long time series TPVs dataset, including the location, radius, intensity, life history, and movement path  and other characteristics. The reanalysis datasets used in the dataset are: NCEP1 (NCEP/NCAR), NCEP2 (NCEP/DOE), ERA-Interim, ERA-40, ERA-5, CFSR, MERRA2, JRA55, NCEP FNL, CRA40, etc. NCEP1 and NCEP2 have lower resolution and the obtained highland low vortices are not applicable as climate feature analysis.",
            "instructions": "File naming: The TPVs dataset is stored in text format, and the file name is \"reanalysis data-yyyy.txt\", where yyyy is the year, e.g. ERA5-2010.txt means that the file describes the TPVs obtained from the ERA5 reanalysis data for the year 2010.\nThe first row shows the number of TPVs for that year, and the second row gives the TPV properties for each column.\nAfter that, the first line of each TPV gives the name and the number of atcive times. A TPV is named as: TPV_YYYYMMDDHH_LON_LAT, YYYY, MM, DD, and HH are the year, month, and day when the TPV was generated, and LON and LAT are the initial locations of the TPV.\nThe location and properties of the TPV for each time step are given line by line.",

For these vortexes, the longer the lifetime, the lower the frequency, and 81% of the TPVs are initially warm in nature. The particularly high-intensity vortexes occur dominantly in the rainy period (May–September), with their origin mainly in western Nagqu and northern Ali. They disappear largely in the Tanggula maintain area on the east side of the vortex high-frequency center and the Dangqu River valley in western Qinghai Province, possibly due to the topography. It is also found that the frequency of TPVs is decreasing, with 2 fewer TPV occurrences per 10 yr. Meanwhile, it is statistically significant that 1.4 fewer TPVs move out of the TP and the percentage of TPVs moving out of the TP versus the total number of TPVs has reduced by 2.3% every 10 yr."
