            "description": "The data are 40Ar-39Ar ages of biotite from the Miaoershan dome in Xuefeng mountain, South China. Mica schist was collected in the field, and then the rock samples were cleaned and crushed, and then biotite particles were selected by hand under the binocular microscope. The experiments were carried out in 40Ar / 39Ar and U-Th / he laboratories of the Key Laboratory of Geology and Geophysics, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Firstly, the high-resolution 40Ar / 39Ar of mm5400 mass spectrometer was measured, and then the original data was further processed by the plug-in ararcalc of Excel software. The data provide chronological support for the collapse process and dynamic mechanism of Triassic Xuefengshan plateau.\nThe above data have been published in Tectonophysics, and the data are true and reliable.",
