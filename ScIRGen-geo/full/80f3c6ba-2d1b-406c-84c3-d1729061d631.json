Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner has unlimited numbers of returns intensities measurements including the first, second, third return intensities. The wavelength of laser light is 1064 nm. The absolute flight altitude is 5200 m with the point cloud density 1 point per square meter. Airborne LiDAR-DEM and DSM data production were obtained through parameter calibration, automatic classification of point cloud density and manual editing.",

The LiDAR operates at a wavelength of 1064nm and captures multiple echoes, including first, second, third, and last returns. The flight altitude is set to 5200 meters above mean sea level, covering terrain with elevation ranging from 2660 to 4307 meters, with an average point cloud density of 1 point per square meter.

                    "Answer": "Lidar technology, particularly the ALS70 system, is significant in ecological hydrology remote sensing experiments as it utilizes a laser wavelength of 1064nm with multiple echoes to collect high-resolution data. It allows for detailed mapping of terrain elevations and features through processes like parameter calibration, point cloud classification, and editing, resulting in DSM and DEM data products. The ALS70 system's capability to operate at high altitudes, such as 5200 meters, with an average point cloud density of 1 point per square meter, makes it particularly effective for capturing accurate topographical data in diverse and challenging terrains.",

In this specific survey, the absolute flight altitude was 5200 meters, with terrain elevation ranging from 2660 meters to 4307 meters, affecting the average point cloud density, which was 1 point per square meter.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of conducting lidar airborne remote sensing experiments using the ALS70 system in the Heihe River Basin is to collect high-resolution topographic data across the upstream sample strip area. This involves capturing detailed point cloud data with an average density of 1 point per square meter to ultimately generate DSM (Digital Surface Model) and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data products. These products are crucial for understanding the ecological and hydrological characteristics of the region.",

The flight is conducted at an absolute altitude of 5200 meters over a sample area with ground elevations ranging from 2660 meters to 4307 meters. The point cloud data collected has an average density of 1 point per square meter. Post-flight, the raw data undergoes parameter calibration, automatic point cloud classification, and manual editing to produce final DSM (Digital Surface Model) and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data products.",
