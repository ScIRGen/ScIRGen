                "Near-surface soil moisture plays an important role in the terrestrial water cycle and land–atmosphere interactions, especially in semiarid regions where strong coupling between surface layer soil moisture and precipitation occurs. When applied at global scale, soil moisture can be obtained through land surface model, remote sensing, or land data assimilation with different levels of accuracy and reliability. All these estimates need validation against in situ measurements. For decades, a number of soil moisture monitoring networks have been established worldwide to obtain the ground truth. In spite of this, gaps of spatial representativeness between a single site and remote sensing pixel or a land surface model grid still exist and thus require the upscaling of ground-based soil moisture observations. Prior to the upscaling, a basic understanding on how the spatiotemporal variability of surface layer soil water content influences the estimation of areal mean soil moisture (AMSM) is necessary. The NRS stands for the minimum number of sites required to estimate AMSM within a predetermined accuracy, given that the sites are randomly but relatively uniformly distributed in space. The MRS is a single site within an existing soil moisture network that can consistently characterize AMSM even with some certain positive or negative offset."

Then, a strategy called optimal combination of sites (OCS) to estimate AMSM was proposed, which may give more robust estimate of AMSM under different soil wetness conditions and within multi-depths of soil."

This provides guidance for future soil moisture network establishment in similar regions; (b) both number of required sites and the most representative site are insensitive to temporal scales while conversely sensitive to soil wetness conditions; (c) the combination of a few optimally-selected sites can give more robust estimate of areal mean soil moisture than a single site does because the former contains more information on spatial heterogeneity."

Knowledge regarding the regional/global soil moisture state is essential for understanding, modeling, and forecasting of the weather/climate, flood/drought early warning and monitoring, and crop yield estimation. However, in situ observations are too sparse to provide large-scale spatiotemporal features of soil moisture. By contrast, satellite microwave remote sensing is a promising approach to provide large-scale soil moisture state, with advantages of short revisit period and all-weather ability. With the launch of several microwave instruments over the past two decades, great efforts have been focused on developing the global soil moisture products from active/passive microwave signals. Currently, L band microwave satellites are considered to be the most promising for estimating surface soil moisture. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission of European Space Agency (ESA) carries the first operational L band radiometer to produce soil moisture product with a spatial resolution of ~40 km. The latest L band satellite, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission of NASA, carries a radiometer and a radar."

At each station, one SMTM sensor is obliquely inserted into 0–5 cm topsoil, which is comparable to the depth penetrated by L band passive microwave sensors (e.g., the SMOS and SMAP). In Pali Network, 21 SMTM stations were deployed during the summer of 2015. The installation of soil moisture and temperature sensors is the same as that of Naqu network. In consideration of the spatial representativeness issue, the measurements from SMTM stations of the Naqu large-scale network are averaged to represent the ground truth of Naqu network.

However, the SMAP product well captures the amplitude and temporal variation of the soil moisture. The SMOS product performs well in Naqu network with acceptable error metrics but fails to capture the temporal variation of soil moisture in Pali network. The AMSR2 products evidently exaggerate the temporal variation of soil moisture in Naqu network but dampen it in Pali network, suggesting its retrieval algorithm needs further improvements for the TP."
