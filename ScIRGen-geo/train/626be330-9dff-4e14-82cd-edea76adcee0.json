Based on the data of GDP, population, land ues, road density and river density in the Belt and Road, this dataset combined with the methods of spatial analysis of ArcGIS, assigning different weights to each indicator and building assessment 34 key nodes under the condition of extreme precipitation in flood vulnerability level, which was divided into 5 levels by using natural break point method, representing no vulnerability, low vulnerability, middle vulnerability, high vulnerability, extreme high vulnerability, respectively.",
