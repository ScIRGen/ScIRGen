            "description": "The development of key modules in the ecosystem model ORCHIDEE was carried out to more accurately simulate the impacts of land use change on the ecosystem carbon sink on the Tibetan Plateau. First, the age classes module was developed and successfully applied to characterize the age structure of forests and age classes of other land use types. The original number of vegetation functional types was extended, and new customized vegetation functional types were generated using model profiles. The customized vegetation functional types set forests into six age classes and other vegetation types into two age classes ranging from young to old, and set biomass thresholds for different age classes according to the growth equations of the different vegetation types in order to characterize what age class each vegetation type is in at different moments along the way. Such development enabled the model to effectively characterize the age classes of each vegetation type at the scale of the subset of pixels. Second, modules for conversion between different age classes and between land use types, as well as modules for manual forest management and wood harvest, were developed to enable the model to more accurately simulate the impacts of land use change on the carbon cycle. Last, the grassland management and grazing modules in the ORCHIDEE_GM version were integrated to further enrich the functionality of the ecosystem model. The data content involves elements such as the age class module, conversion module, manual forest management, wood harvest, and grassland management. The development of these modules is of great importance, providing key technical support for modeling the ecosystem carbon cycle under land use change on the Tibetan Plateau and contributing to a deeper understanding of the impacts of human activities on carbon sink. The data were derived from the development process of the ORCHIDEE model, and the processing methodology included the extension and customization of the model's functions, setting key parameters such as biomass thresholds according to different vegetation types and age classes. The quality of the data is high, based on the extension and improvement of the ORCHIDEE model, after systematic module design and testing. However, the accuracy and reliability of the model still need to be continuously verified and improved in practical applications. The development of these modules provided a key tool for a deeper understanding of the impacts of land use change on ecosystem carbon sinks in the Tibetan Plateau. In the future, they can be used in the assessment of climate change impacts, the formulation of ecosystem management policies, and the study of optimal management of carbon sink, which will provide important support for the realization of sustainable development and ecological protection.

By incorporating these modules, the model can effectively represent the age structure of vegetation at a sub-pixel level and simulate the transitions between different age groups and land-use types.

This includes expanding the number of vegetation functional types and generating new custom vegetation functional types via model configuration files. Forests are set into six age groups, while other vegetation types have two age groups, representing stages from young to old. Biomass thresholds are established for each age group based on specific growth equations for different vegetation types. Additionally, conversion modules for transitions between age groups and land use types are developed, along with modules for plantation management and timber harvesting. These are integrated with grassland management and grazing modules from the ORCHIDEE_GM version to enhance the model's functionality. This comprehensive development and integration enable the model to simulate carbon cycle impacts due to land use changes accurately.",
