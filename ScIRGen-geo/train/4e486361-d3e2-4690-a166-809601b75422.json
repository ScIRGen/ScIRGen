            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Huailai station eddy covariance system (EC) from April 13 to December 31 in 2021. The site (115.7923° E, 40.3574° N) was located in the maize surface, near Donghuayuan town of Huailai city in Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&EC150) was 0 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC) (class1-9). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. There were lots of negative values of H2O density in winter where filling by -6999. \nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al.

                    "Answer": "The need for data post-processing steps such as coordinate rotation and frequency response correction arises due to the inherent characteristics of eddy covariance measurements. Coordinate rotation is necessary to align the wind measurements to the main wind direction, and frequency response correction is required to account for the limitations in the instrument’s response to different frequency components of the turbulence. These steps help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the derived fluxes, addressing issues like instrument misalignment and sensor response characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "Applying post-processing techniques such as wild point value removal, delay time correction, and coordinate rotation to raw eddy covariance data can significantly enhance data quality and reliability by eliminating erroneous values, aligning measurement timing, and adjusting measurements to account for instrument orientation. These corrections help in obtaining more accurate and representative flux measurements, leading to data that better reflects actual environmental conditions. Additionally, these processes contribute to a higher level of confidence in the derived fluxes, such as sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and CO2 flux, as they undergo rigorous quality assessments, including atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity tests.",
