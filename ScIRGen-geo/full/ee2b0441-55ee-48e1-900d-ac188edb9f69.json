            "description": "Surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), ultraviolet-A (UVA), ultraviolet-B (UVB), and shortwave radiation (SWR), with high spatial-temporal resolutions and precision, are essential in solar power application, vegetation photosynthesis, environmental health and so on. In this work, an optimal algorithm was developed for calculating direct and diffuse components. Distinguished features of the algorithm include a combination of the radiative transfer model with machine learning techniques, and full consideration of input data like aerosol types, cloud phase and gas components. The algorithm was used to construct the near real-time monitoring system based on Himawari-8 and Fengyun-4A satellites and to generate the corresponding data products. The validation with the ground-based data shows that the accuracy of the new products (e.g., daily mean RMSRs of the SWR and PAR is 19.7 Wm-2, 9.2 Wm-2) are significantly better than that of other widely used products, including CERES (24.7 Wm-2, 11.4 Wm-2), ERA5 (35.1 Wm-2, 16.4 Wm-2) and GLASS (29.4 Wm-2, 13.5 Wm-2). Direct and diffuse components of our products are comparable to the CERES or even better than the ERA5.",

Satellite remote sensing data can be used to retrieve spatiotemporally continuous SSR data over a wide range of areas. Currently, several well-known global SSR products exist: the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project flux data set (ISCCP-FD) from satellite measurements, the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment surface radiation budget (GEWEX-SRB), the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products. Three of the above global SSR data sets (ISCCP-FD, GEWEX-SRB, CERES) provide long-term global SSR data, but they are spatially too coarse (≥100 km) to meet the requirements of many land surface process studies and practical applications. In recent years, new-generation geostationary satellites, such as Himawari-8, GOES-R, and FY-4, which have greatly improved in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, have provided new opportunities to access the SSR."
