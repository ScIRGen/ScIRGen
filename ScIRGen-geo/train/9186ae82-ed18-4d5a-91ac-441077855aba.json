It consists of three parts, of which the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau part uses the simulated permafrost map of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Nanzhuo Copper, 2002), the northeast part comes from the \"14 million map of China's Glacier, Frozen Soil and Desert\" (Institute of Environment and Engineering in Cold and Arid Regions, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2006), and the other part uses the map of China's permafrost zoning and types (1: 10 million) (Zhou Youwu and others, 2000).\nMore Information References (Institute of Environment and Engineering in Cold and Arid Regions, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2006;  Nanzhuo Copper, 2002;  Zhou Youwu et al., 2000;  Li et al, 2008）。",

It includes integrating data from different sources such as simulation models of the Tibetan Plateau, maps from the Northeast region, and other regional classifications, aiming to create a comprehensive view of frozen soil types across China.",

The dataset was compiled by analyzing existing permafrost maps, incorporating simulated data for the Tibetan Plateau, and utilizing different regional datasets such as the 1:400万中国冰川冻土沙漠图 and the 中国冻土区划及类型图. Each of these sources provided particular insights and regional specificity necessary for creating a comprehensive permafrost type map at a 1:1000万 scale.",

Challenges likely included ensuring consistency and accuracy across different datasets, such as the simulated maps for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the maps from different regions like Northeast China, which were based on varying methodologies and scales.",
