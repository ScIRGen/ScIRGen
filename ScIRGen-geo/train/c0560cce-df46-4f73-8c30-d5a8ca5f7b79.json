            "description": "This data set was acquired by the L & K band airborne microwave radiometer on the morning of April 1, 2008, in the A'rou flight zone. \nThe frequency of L-band is 1.4GHz, and the backsight is 35 degrees to obtain dual polarization (H and V) information; the frequency of K-band is 18.7ghz, and there is no polarization information. The plane took off from Zhangye airport at 8:06 (Beijing time, the same below) and landed at 11:17. 8: 50-10:13 fly from north to south, observe and reserve 10 routes, flight height is about 4100m, flight speed is about 260km / hr. 10: At 20-10:35, Jiafei 6-8 and 6-9 lines completed the observation. \nThe original data is divided into two parts: microwave radiometer data and GPS data. The L and K bands of microwave radiometer are non imaging observations. The digital values obtained from the instantaneous observation are recorded in the text file, and the longitude and latitude as well as the aircraft attitude parameters are recorded in the GPS data. When using microwave radiometer to observe data, it is necessary to convert the digital value recorded into the bright temperature value according to the calibration coefficient (the calibration coefficient file is filed with the original observation data). At the same time, through the clock records of microwave radiometer and GPS, we can connect the microwave observation with GPS record and match the geographic coordinate information for the microwave observation. Due to the coarse observation resolution of microwave radiometer, the effects of aircraft yaw, roll and pitch are generally ignored in data processing. According to the target and flight relative altitude (H), after calibration and coordinate matching, the observation information can also be gridded. The resolution (x) of L band and K band is consistent with that of observation footprint. The reference resolution is: L band, x = 0.3H; K band, x = 0.24h. After the above steps, we can get the products that users can use directly.",

                    "Answer": "The relationship between flight altitude and microwave radiometer data resolution can be inferred through the principle that resolution is proportional to the relative flight altitude (H). For instance, in the L band, the resolution is expressed as x = 0.3H, and in the K band, x = 0.24H. This indicates that as the flight altitude increases, the spatial resolution of the data also increases, affecting the size of the observational footprint.",

Calibration is necessary to convert these values into meaningful brightness temperature measurements, which are essential for accurate data interpretation. The calibration coefficients, which are archived with the original observation data, allow researchers to transform the digital values into brightness temperatures, making the data usable for scientific analysis. This process ensures that the data accurately reflect the observed phenomena and can be reliably used in subsequent research and applications.",

                    "Answer": "When integrating microwave radiometer data with GPS data during airborne observations, the potential consequence is enhanced usability of the data due to the assignment of geographic coordinates to the microwave observations. This allows for more accurate spatial representation of the data. However, because the microwave radiometer has a relatively coarse resolution, certain aspects such as aircraft yaw, roll, and pitch effects are generally ignored, which might limit the precision of spatial data. After calibration and coordinate matching, the observations can be rasterized, maintaining a resolution consistent with the observation footprint. This process ultimately leads to the creation of data products that users can directly employ, with the L and K band resolutions being approximately proportional to the flying altitude.",

The L band (1.4GHz) offers dual polarization observations, while the K band (18.7GHz) provides zenith angle observations without polarization information.

This involves associating the radiometer's recorded digital values with these coefficients, which are archived alongside the original observational data. The calibration aligns the microwave radiometer observations with GPS data, using each system’s clock to match microwave observations with geographic coordinates. Post-calibration, the data can be rasterized based on the specific observational footprint resolution, with the L band having a resolution of x=0.3H and the K band x=0.24H, where H is the relative flight altitude. This process results in a product that can be directly utilized for further analysis.",

The GPS data provide the latitude, longitude, and aircraft attitude parameters, which, combined with the time-synchronized microwave data, enable the matching of microwave observations with geolocation information.",
