            "description": "The Map of Permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (1:3,000,000) (Shude Li and Guodong Cheng, 1996) was made by the State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soil Engineering, LIGG, CAS (currently called the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences). It was based on first-hand information from the study of frozen soil and previous research papers and literature. By detailed study and consultation of aerial photographs, satellite images, the Permafrost Map along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway (1:600,000) (Boliang Tong, et al., 1983), Geomorphological Map of the Qilian Mountains (1:1,000,000) (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1985), Natural Landscape Map of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (1:3,000,000) (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1990), Quaternary Glacial Distribution Map of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (1:3,000,000) (Bingyuan Li and Jijun Li, 1991), Frozen Soil Remote Sensing Map of the Western Channel Project of the South-North Water Diversion in the Region of the Tongtian-Yalong Rivers (1:500,000) (Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1995), and Map of Snow, Ice, Frozen Ground in China (1:4,000,000) (Yafeng Shi and Desheng Mi, 1988), with editing on 1,000,000 aerial survey topographic maps, and the 1:3,000,000 Map of Permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was then generated. It was later digitized by Zhuotong Nan of the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nThe data include:\n1) Digitized distribution map of frozen soil on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau\n2) Scanned map of frozen soil map on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau\nThe types of frozen soil in the digitized frozen soil map include:\n0. Seasonally frozen ground; seasonal frozen soil\n1. Permafrost\n2. Island permafrost; \n3. Continuous permafrost;",

                    "Answer": "A digital permafrost distribution map refers to a map that has been digitized to show the distribution of different types of permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This includes data from various sources such as aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and previous research, which have been compiled and processed to create a comprehensive digital map depicting permafrost types like seasonally frozen ground, permafrost, island permafrost, and continuous permafrost.",

                    "Answer": "The field data collection methods integrate aerial and satellite imagery with traditional ground-based surveys. The aerial and satellite imagery provide large-scale and remote observations, which are useful for accessing vast and difficult-to-reach areas like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These methods allow for the identification and mapping of permafrost types over extensive regions. In contrast, traditional ground-based surveys offer more detailed, localized, and potentially more accurate data but are limited by accessibility and coverage. Combining these approaches allows for a comprehensive understanding of permafrost distribution, leveraging the strengths of both large-scale remote sensing and detailed localized surveys.",

This process allows for the integration and comparison of historical data with contemporary observations to enhance understanding of permafrost distribution and changes over time.",
