            "description": "This data set mainly includes the whole rock major and trace, zircon U-Pb-Hf isotope data and biotite Ar-Ar chronology data of paragneiss in Xilinhot area, Inner Mongolia. The samples are collected from Xilinguole complex, including biotite plagioclase gneiss, two mica plagioclase gneiss and sericite plagioclase gneiss. The major elements of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, trace elements by ICP-MS analysis, zircon U-Pb isotope data by LA-ICPMS analysis, zircon Hf isotope data by MC-ICPMS analysis, biotite Ar -Ar data by GV-5400 mass spectrometer analysis. The above data have been published in the international well-known journal Gondwana research, and the data are authentic. Through this set of data, we can effectively identify the fore arc sedimentary basin system of the South Mongolia micro block, constrain the rock formation age and material source, and indicate the tectonic affinity of the South Mongolia micro block.",

                    "Answer": "In geochemical studies of metamorphic rocks, XRF is typically used for analyzing major elements due to its ability to handle larger sample volumes and provide accurate quantification of these elements. ICP-MS, on the other hand, is used for trace element analysis because of its high sensitivity and capability to detect low concentrations. Both methods are complementary, with XRF offering robust data for major elements and ICP-MS providing detailed insights into trace elements, making them both precise and applicable for comprehensive geochemical analysis.",

                    "Answer": "Employing diverse analytical techniques can lead to a comprehensive understanding of the geochemical composition and isotopic characteristics of metamorphic rocks. Specifically, XRF and ICP-MS can provide detailed information on major and trace elements, respectively, which helps in understanding the elemental abundance and distribution. LA-ICPMS and MC-ICPMS enable precise zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic analysis, crucial for dating and determining the source characteristics of the rocks. Ar-Ar dating on biotite can provide additional age constraints. Together, these techniques can effectively identify geological processes such as basin formation and tectonic affinity, while also constraining the formation age and material sources of the studied rocks.",
