However, there might be challenges in correlating these historical data with current observations due to changes in climate, land use, and glacial morphology since the 1980s. This historical perspective can highlight the extent of glacial retreat or advancement and help assess the impact of climate change on the region's glaciers.",

Specific glaciers in the Gongga Mountain area have their basic characteristics, AAR values, avalanche area, and thickness measured and recorded. Additionally, snowline data and related parameters for some glaciers in China are compiled.",
