                "Glacier extent is regulated by global climate change. The relationship between glacial extent and climate change is commonly defined by the sensitivity indicator of environmental and climate change. Studying the glacier extent change and its response to the climate change will contribute to knowledge about the regional water-heat balance studies. Glaciers are also an important global water resource, for example, more than 1/6 of the global population depends on glaciers or seasonal perpetual snow for fresh water supplying. Especially in the third pole over the world, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and surrounding arid and semi-arid areas, glaciers are not only an important recharge source for surface rivers, lakes and groundwater in the middle and lower reaches of the basin, but also an important water source for regional production and domestic water in the oases, which play an important role in the natural ecological environment evolution, agricultural production, and social economic sustainable development. However, in the background of global warming, the global glacier area and volume show a decreasing trend, and snow lines are retreating. Meanwhile, glacier ablation will increase river discharge and runoff in the short term, which would relieve pressure on water consumption for agricultural, industrial, and living activities in the middle and lower reaches of the basin. However, the excessive ablation of glacier will lead to a fatal influence on water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. Therefore, examining the response of glacier extent to climate change has significance for regional water resource regulation and control."

The number of patches, mean patch area, and largest patch index all demonstrated a decreasing trend, and the splitting index showed an increasing trend, indicating that glaciers in Hala Lake Basin fragmented during the recent 30 years. Analyses of DEM data showed that with the increasing altitude, glacier ablation rate decreased. Glacier ablation was primarily concentrated from 4500-5000m as well as in steep slope and gentle steep slope. The recession rate in sunny slope was obviously larger than that in shady slope. Geometric center of glacier in the basin moved from southwest to northeast towards high altitude. Temperature was the dominant factor effecting glacier area dynamic change in the Hala Lake Basin, indicating that the glacier area would decrease and fragment continually as a result of global warming on the Tibetan Plateau in future decades."
