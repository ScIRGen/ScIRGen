                "Aerosol lidar is widely used in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height calculation due to its high spatio-temporal resolution. The PBL is directly coupled with the earth’s surface. Through the PBL, rapid exchanges of momentum, heat, moisture, natural, and anthropogenic pollutants take place between the free atmosphere and surface. A fundamental variable of the PBL is its top height (PBLH), which determines turbulence and dispersion for pollutants and is involved in many predictive and diagnostic methods and/or models that assess pollutant concentrations. Inside of the PBL, the pollutants are vertically transported due to strong turbulence, while there usually exists an inversion layer at the top of the PBL preventing pollutants from being transported up to the free troposphere. Many techniques have been developed to determine the PBLH, for example, through radiosonde measurements and remote sensing instruments by measuring the vertical structure of wind, temperature, and aerosols. The radiosondes measure the profiles of temperature, humidity, and wind, which can be used to define the PBLH accurately. However, the low temporal resolution of sounding restricts this method in capturing the diurnal structure of PBL since soundings are conventionally conducted only twice a day at specified synoptic times. The high spatiotemporal resolutions of aerosol lidar make it one of the most suitable instruments in analyzing the boundary layer structure and the PBLH calculation. The PBL owns a diurnal cycle that can be classified into three major regimes: convective boundary layer (CBL), stable boundary layer (SBL), and residual layer (RL). Strong turbulence mixing causes nearly uniform vertical distributions of aerosols within the CBL. Many methods are developed in the PBLH calculation base on this negative aerosol gradient: gradient method, wavelet covariance transform, and idealized-profile method. High aerosols in the RL also create a significant negative gradient in aerosol, which is so far the most challenging part in any gradient-based technique. The comparisons of the PBLH defined by aerosol lidar with radiosonde indicate that the PBLH defined by the two methods have good correlation with differences of 100 – 300 m under convection weather cases, while under non-convective weather conditions, the two methods have much larger differences in the PBLH estimations. The nocturnal PBLH seems to be overestimated due to the existence of the RL, which is similar as the influence of cloud in the PBLH estimations."

This correction ensures that the recorded signal accurately represents the backscatter from atmospheric constituents at various altitudes, which is necessary for accurate retrieval of optical and microphysical properties of aerosols, clouds, and water vapor.",

As the laser light travels through the atmosphere, the intensity of the backscattered signal decreases with the square of the distance from the lidar. This correction ensures that the signal strength is accurately represented, allowing for the correct interpretation of the vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents such as aerosols, clouds, and water vapor.",
