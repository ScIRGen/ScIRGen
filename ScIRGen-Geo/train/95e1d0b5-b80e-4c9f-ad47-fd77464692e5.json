            "description": "As the main parameter in the land surface energy balance, surface temperature indicates the degree of land-atmosphere energy and water transfer and is widely used in research on climatology, hydrology and ecology.\nIn the study of frozen soil, climate is one of the decisive factors for the existence and development of frozen soil. The surface temperature is the main climatic factor affecting the distribution of frozen soil and affects the occurrence, development and distribution of frozen soil. It is the upper boundary condition for modelling frozen soil and is significant to the study of hydrological processes in cold regions.\nThe data set was based on the DEM and observation station data of the Tibetan Plateau Engineering Corridor and analysed the changing trend of surface temperature on the Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2014. Using the surface temperature data products MOD11A1/A2 and MYD11A1/A2 of MODIS aboard Terra and Aqua, the surface temperature information under cloud cover was reconstructed based on the spatio-temporal information of the images. The reconstruction information and surface temperature representativeness problems were analysed using information obtained from 8 sites, including the Kunlun Mountains (wetland, grassland), Beiluhe (grassland, meadow), Kaixinling (meadow, grassland), and Tanggula Mountain (meadow, wetland). According to the correlation coefficient (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean deviation (MBE), the following results were obtained: (1) the reconstruction accuracy of MODIS surface temperature under cloud cover is higher when it is based on spatio-temporal information; (2) the weighted average representation is the best when generalizing four observations of Terra and Aqua.\nBy analysing the reconstruction of MODIS surface temperature information and representativeness problems, the average annual MODIS surface temperature data of the Tibetan Plateau and the engineering corridor from 2000 to 2010 were obtained. According to the data set, the surface temperature from 2000 to 2010 also experienced volatile rising trends from 2000 to 2010, which is basically consistent with the changing trend of the climate change in the permafrost regions of the Tibetan Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor.",

                "When studying the human settlement process, it is of great significance to understand the prehistoric environment, economy and society by exploring the human–land relationship and the evolution of civilization reflected by the settlement environment. This research provides a reference for the process, representation, driving mode, and research ideas of early human settlement preferences. As the spatial relics of early human activities, settlement sites carry and record information about early human adaptation and transformation of the environment, interpreting and revealing the environmental information of settlement distribution can provide conditions for further understanding the interaction between humans and the environment during this period. Attempts to explain the relationships among prehistoric human settlement information, the development of early civilizations, and the natural environment date back to the 1950s. Currently, the preference for human settlement in China is mainly based on the geographical and environmental characteristics of site distribution, and the natural environment preference of prehistoric settlement sites in different regions and periods has been explored. The current research on the prehistoric culture in the region has discussed cultural exchanges, livelihood patterns, climate and environmental change processes and their impacts of prehistoric humans, but there have been fewer studies of behavioural preferences in settlement selection, and more emphasis has been placed on interpreting the decisive impact of the environment on human beings.",
                "The settlement preference system is the product of human practice in the human–earth system, including the natural environment preference at the material level and the social and cultural preferences at the nonmaterial level. From the perspective of human factors, there are needs such as early natural worship, livelihood forms, external transportation, tribal inheritance, security and defence, group cognitive guidance, cultural integration and diffusion, and the emergence of rights organizations. In terms of natural environmental factors, there are physical needs in the settlement process, such as suitability of topography and geomorphology, liveable climatic conditions, high biodiversity, proximity to water sources, a moderate number of vegetation types and moderate vegetation coverage, good soil fertility, abundant sunlight, a relatively low likelihood of disasters and suitable elevations. The study of the relationship between early human settlement and the geographical background is a key aspect of research on early human activities, covering the relationships of settlement activities with topography, the water system, regional structure, soil, climate and many other factors. The availability of water sources is an essential factor for human survival. The influence of elevation on human beings involves many factors, such as atmospheric physics, geochemistry and ecology. The spatial connection between the two is the strongest, and settlement activity is the most likely to produce cultural preferences. The essence of this settlement cluster behaviour lies in the development of productivity. Humans have progressed from fishing and hunting to farming.",
                "Early human settlement activities in Xinjiang showed different preferences for natural environmental and social environmental conditions in different periods. Climate change and livelihood patterns had significant impact on settlement preferences as settlement activities adapted to and remodelled changes in the natural environment. The cultural preference for settlement activities was strong, and the human initiative factor was the main controlling factor. Early human settlement was affected by strong geographical conditions, such as rivers, slopes, the elevation and other factors. Referring to Zhu et al.'s simulation method of early human traffic routes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this paper uses ArcGIS hydrological analysis and other tools to simulate the traffic routes in Xinjiang to analyse the impact of traffic factors on settlement activities and to interpret the traffic preferences of early human settlement. Thiessen Polygons is a space segmentation method that seamlessly divides the plane space according to the known point set. The Maxent model is the realization of the maximum entropy theory."

Based on the settlement preference characteristics, the Maxent model is used to predict the settlements in different periods to further understand the evolution of civilization in Xinjiang, to understand the relationship between the early human settlement process and the natural and social environment; and to provide a reference for the excavation and protection of sites in subsequent steps.",
                "We believe that settlement needs and environmental conditions gradually formed a relatively stable and progressive interactive relationship in the process of adaptation and transformation. Therefore, it is necessary to use the natural environmental conditions that affect the distribution of settlement sites as simulation factors to identify traffic routes as comprehensively as possible."

                "Currently, there is no uniform classification standard for the distance from human settlements to rivers in early stages. The alternation of cold and warm climatic conditions, dry and wet changes, and changes in topography have caused rivers to form, disappear, and change. Therefore, the distribution of modern rivers might not reflect the distribution of rivers in earlier periods.",
                "Due to the lack of written records, high-precision map records and road sites, the early traffic routes in most regions remain unclear. Although we can deduce the early lines from the existing settlement sites, this inversion is bound to be affected by the excavation of settlement sites. The traffic routes in the settlement distribution areas that have completely disappeared and have not been excavated cannot be effectively identified, and the accuracy of traffic route identification is affected."

Therefore, this paper uses the hydrology tool set in ArcGIS software to extract the potential rivers in Xinjiang. Since the river extraction process changes with the size of the raster calculator extraction threshold, this paper sets the threshold to 200,000 after attempting and integrating the extracted rivers with the data from modern rivers to simulate all possible rivers. Guided by the idea of constructing the resistance surface in the minimum resistance model, this paper simulates the early human traffic routes in Xinjiang with the early traffic route simulation method developed by Zhu et al. The resistance surface of the simulation factors was constructed, and the resistance level was divided. The Maxent model was used to predict the locations of settlements in the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Ages.",

Based on the above data, ArcGIS10.2 software was used to extract and produce data on the elevation, slope, water system, slope, slope direction, soil type and landform type for each site. In this paper, the maximum entropy distribution is obtained using the settlement data as a constraint condition and the environmental impact background of the settlement distribution as a variable. The prediction results of the model were tested by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The final results were loaded into ArcGIS software to visualize the settlement distribution probability map."
