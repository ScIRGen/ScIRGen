            "description": "Near-surface air temperature variability and the reliability of temperature extrapolation within glacierized regions are important issues for hydrological and glaciological studies that remain elusive because of the scarcity of high-elevation observations. Based on air temperature data in 2019 collected from 12 automatic weather stations, 43 temperature loggers and 6 national meteorological stations in six different catchments, this study presents air temperature variability in different glacierized/nonglacierized regions and assesses the robustness of different temperature extrapolations to reduce errors in melt estimation. The results show high spatial variability in temperature lapse rates (LRs) in different climatic contexts, with the steepest LRs located on the cold-dry northwestern Tibetan Plateau and the lowest LRs located on the warm-humid monsoonal-influenced southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Near-surface air temperatures in high-elevation glacierized regions of the western and central Tibetan Plateau are less influenced by katabatic winds and thus can be linearly extrapolated from off-glacier records. In contrast, the local katabatic winds prevailing on the temperate glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau exert pronounced cooling effects on the ambient air temperature, and thus, on-glacier air temperatures are significantly lower than that in elevation-equivalent nonglacierized regions. Consequently, linear temperature extrapolation from low-elevation nonglacierized stations may lead to as much as 40% overestimation of positive degree days, particularly with respect to large glaciers with a long flowline distances and significant cooling effects. These findings provide noteworthy evidence that the different LRs and relevant cooling effects on high-elevation glaciers under distinct climatic regimes should be carefully accounted for when estimating glacier melting on the Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial heterogeneity of temperature lapse rates (LRs) in different climatic backgrounds suggests significant challenges in predicting temperature changes in high-altitude glacier regions. The steepest LRs are found in the cold, dry northwestern Tibetan Plateau, while the lowest LRs are in the southeastern part, influenced by warm, moist monsoon climates. This variability indicates that different regions may require distinct approaches to accurately predict temperature changes, especially when considering the effects of local descending winds that can significantly cool ambient temperatures and impact predictions.",

                    "Answer": "The challenge of accurately predicting temperature changes in glacier regions at high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau is influenced by the lack of high-altitude observations and the spatial heterogeneity of temperature lapse rates (LRs) under different climate backgrounds. The most significant factors include the steepest LRs in the cold and arid northwest of the plateau and the lowest LRs in the southeast affected by warm and moist monsoons. Additionally, the local cooling effects of katabatic winds on temperate glaciers in the southeast result in significantly lower temperatures compared to non-glacier areas at the same altitude, leading to potential overestimation of positive degree days when using linear temperature predictions from non-glacier stations.",
