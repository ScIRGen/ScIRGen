            "description": "This data set includes the light absorption data of carbon components in the atmosphere and precipitation at typical stations on the Tibetan Plateau (Ranwu (2018-2021), Namco (2013-2016), Everest (2013-2016), Lulang (2015-2016)). All samples were collected on the spot from various sampling points. The concentrations of black carbon and water-soluble organic carbon, as well as the light absorption data were measured, using the index (MAC value) representing the light absorption capacity, The MAC values of light absorption of water-soluble organic carbon and black carbon are calculated. This data is of great significance for evaluating the radiative forcing of carbon particles in the atmosphere, and is an important basic data input for model simulation.",

This data is crucial as it provides foundational input for models that simulate the radiative effects of carbonaceous particles.
