            "description": "Apatite (U-Th)/He data from the Nuomuhong region of the East Kunlun Shan. Apatite (U-Th)/He analysis was conducted at the State Key Laboratory of Earthquake Dynamics, Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration using the Australian Scientific Instruments (ASI) Alphachron noble gas mass spectrometer and Agilent 7900 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Reproducibility within each sample were reasonably good. We determine the paleodepth of each sample by measuring the distance perpendicularly from the erosion surface to the sample. All new and published ages are plotted against their paleodepth. The age-paleodepth relationship shows a break in slope at ~25 Ma, which is interpreted to initiation of thrusting at northern margin of the East Kunlun Shan.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of geological data collection, '磷灰石（U-Th）／He年龄-古深度曲线' refers to a plot or relationship that shows the variation of (U-Th)/He ages of apatite samples with respect to their original depth, or paleo-depth. This curve is used to understand the thermal history and exhumation processes of a region by correlating the ages of apatite grains with the depth from which they originated. In this specific context, the curve helps reveal the exhumation history of the East Kunlun Mountains, indicating a rapid exhumation event in the late Oligocene (~25 Ma), which is linked to tectonic activities along the northern margin of the East Kunlun Mountains.",

                    "Answer": "The age-depth relationship in the (U-Th)/He data of apatite from the East Kunlun Mountains can reveal a history of rapid denudation during the late Oligocene (~25 Ma), which is interpreted as the onset of thrusting activity along the northern margin of the East Kunlun Mountains. By using the erosion surfaces as a reference for ancient tectonic deformation, the data provides insights into the timing and processes of tectonic evolution in the region.",

The study uses the curve as a reference for Cenozoic tectonic deformation by comparing new and published samples' vertical distances from the erosion surface.",

The data collection process ensures high data quality with good reproducibility of single grain He ages in the same sample. The procedure includes using the low-relief erosional surface as a horizontal reference for Cenozoic tectonic deformation and establishing an age-paleodepth curve by comparing the vertical distance of samples from the erosional surface to determine ancient depths. This curve helps in understanding the rapid exhumation history during the late Oligocene (~25 Ma), interpreted as the onset of thrusting activity along the northern margin of the East Kunlun Mountains.",
