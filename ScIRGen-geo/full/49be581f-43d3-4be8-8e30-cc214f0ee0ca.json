            "description": "According to the method of runoff segmentation, the runoff recharge analysis is carried out for the typical normal water year or normal water year of Luxia hydrological station, Niyang qujiuba hydrological station, Yigong zangbugongde hydrological station and maguolong zangbugabutong hydrological station in this area (because the measured hydrological data is too short, it can only be selected as normal water year by referring to the data of adjacent hydrological stations and meteorological data) (Table 1). Based on the analysis of the data of four hydrological stations in Nanfeng area, the average annual runoff depth in the catchment area above the station is the largest at gabutong station in maguolong Zangbu, and the smallest at Luxia station in the main stream (Table 2). In some rivers, such as the mainstream of Yarlung Zangbo River and nyangqu River, not only a hydrological station has been set up on one river, but also the average annual runoff depth between the two stations can be calculated. According to the measured data of existing hydrological stations and the annual runoff depth contour, the annual runoff in Nanfeng area can be estimated (Table 3).",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format, including the analysis table of annual runoff supply in Nanfeng region, the statistical table of runoff depth value of hydrological stations in Nanfeng region and other regions in Tibet, and the estimation table of annual runoff of basins in Nanfeng region, with the coordinate table of national river hydrological stations attached.",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method involves using multiple hydrological stations to conduct runoff replenishment analysis. In the Nanga Parbat region, data from stations like the Lusha Hydrological Station on the Yarlung Zangbo River, Jiuwa Hydrological Station on the Niyang River, and others are utilized. These stations help analyze typical average water years or normal water years by referencing neighboring station data and meteorological information, despite the short duration of direct hydrological observations.",

                    "Answer": "In the 南迦巴瓦峰地区, river runoff analysis relies on data from multiple hydrological stations, supplemented by information from neighboring hydrological stations and meteorological data due to the short duration of direct measurements. This enables estimation of average annual runoff depths despite limited direct data. In contrast, other regions with longer measurement periods may rely more heavily on consistent long-term data from a single or fewer number of stations, potentially reducing the need for supplementary data to estimate runoff.",

                    "Answer": "The use of multiple hydrological observation stations on a single river allows for the calculation of average annual runoff depth values across different sections of the river. This approach enables a more detailed analysis of river runoff patterns and water resource estimation, as it provides insights into how runoff contributions vary spatially along the river, allowing researchers to infer more accurate and comprehensive hydrological behavior in the region.",

The analysis is conducted to estimate the average annual runoff depth and provide insights into water resources in the region, especially considering the limitations of short-term hydrological data and the need to use data from neighboring stations and meteorological data.",
