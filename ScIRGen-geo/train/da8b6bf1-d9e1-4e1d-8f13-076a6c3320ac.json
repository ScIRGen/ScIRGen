            "description": "The preparation of this data set is based on the proposed downscaling method of all-weather surface temperature data for the glacier area in Southeast Tibet. By analyzing the relationship between all-weather surface temperature and its spatio-temporal influence factor elevation, surface coverage type, vegetation index, snow cover index, surface reflectance and other data, a downscaling model of all-weather surface temperature is constructed, which increase the spatial resolution of all-weather surface temperature products from 1 km to 250 m. The validation results show that the RMSE of downscaling surface temperature at the site is about 2.25 K and 2.16 K in the daytime and at night, respectively, which is about 0.5 K higher than that of the original 1 km surface temperature product. The results of image quality index show that the downscaling surface temperature not only obtains a lot of detailed thermal information, but also maintains a high consistency with the original 1 km surface temperature in spatial pattern and amplitude. This data set has certain significance for high resolution all-weather surface temperature generation and disaster monitoring in glacier area of  Southeast Tibet.",

                "The land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable in studies of regional climate change, evapotranspiration, and urban heat islands. In recent years, with global warming, glacial debris flows in Southeast Tibet have become more frequent. The formation process of glacial debris flows is highly complex, influenced by factors such as precipitation and glacier meltwater generated by temperature changes. Compared to ground-based measurements, remote sensing of LST can provide large-scale \"surface\" temperature data applicable at regional scales. However, the climate of Southeast Tibet, characterized by persistent cloud cover, severely limits the application of remote sensing LST in this region. Existing 1km resolution all-weather LST products cannot meet the needs of fine-scale research on glacial debris flow disasters in Southeast Tibet, necessitating high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing LST products."

                "Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter for energy exchange between Earth’s surface and the atmosphere and thus an important indicator for global climate change. Since the 1970s, the accurate retrieval of LST from satellite has been an active area of research in quantitative remote sensing. The main sources for retrieving LST from satellite data are thermal-infrared (TIR) remote sensing and passive microwave (MW) remote sensing, which both are effective means for obtaining the radiance emitted by Earth’s surface. Although MW remote sensing is less affected by cloud and fog, when compared to TIR remote sensing, it is limited by factors such as coarser spatial resolution, higher thermal sampling depth, and higher uncertainty in emissivity, which results in a lower retrieval accuracy. Therefore, retrieving LST from TIR remote sensing is still the dominant approach, since it offers a better physical definition and higher retrieval accuracy. A variety of algorithms have been proposed for retrieving LST from TIR data, e.g., split-window algorithms (SWA), mono-window algorithms or single-channel algorithms, and temperature-emissivity separation algorithms (TESs). The SWA is a good choice for retrieving LST from sensors with two or more TIR channels centered at 11 and 12 µm, e.g., Terra/Aqua MODIS, NOAA advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR), ENVISAT AATSR, and Sentinel-3 SLSTR. Currently, several LST products derived from satellite TIR remote sensing are available. Global LST products for Terra/Aqua MODIS are available dating back to 2000, e.g., MOD11/MYD11 and MOD21/MYD21. Similarly, a JPSS-VIIRS LST product is available dating back to 2012 and China FengYun-VIRR LST is available dating back to 2009. In summary, from 1991 onwards, many global and regional satellite LST products are available, but higher spatiotemporal resolutions (e.g., 1 km – daily) are only available after 2000. It has been reported that 1983–2012 was the warmest 30 years for nearly 1400 years. The warm climate change trend has also caused changes in many land surface processes, e.g., most glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau are in retreat and the areas covered by them are getting smaller and smaller. A major factor limiting applications of AVHRR LST is orbital drift, which over the lifespan of the NOAA satellites leads to shifts to later overpass times and, therefore, affects temporal comparability."
