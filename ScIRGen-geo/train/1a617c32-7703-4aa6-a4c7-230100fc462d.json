                    "Answer": "The dataset related to glacial lake inventory in Bhutan uses a Polyconic projection with the Everest (India 1956) ellipsoid and Indian datum, with specific parameters such as a central meridian of 90° 0’ 00” E and a central parallel of 26° 0’ 00” N.

                    "Answer": "The accuracy and reliability of ice lake cataloging techniques in the Bhutan region could be influenced by several factors, including the quality and resolution of the topographic map data used as a reference, the specific attributes cataloged such as lake type, orientation, width, area, depth, and length, and the projection parameters like the Polyconic projection, Everest ellipsoid, and Indian datum. Additionally, the technical support and methodologies developed by organizations such as the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the United Nations Environment Programme/Regional Resource Centre for Asia and the Pacific (UNEP/RRC-AP) could also play a significant role in determining the data's accuracy and reliability.",

                    "Answer": "The cataloging of glacial lakes involves referencing topographic map data, reflecting the status of glacial lakes in the year 2000, and covers various sub-basins in Bhutan. The cataloging includes attributes such as glacial lake type, orientation, width, area, depth, and length. The data is projected using the Polyconic projection, with specific parameters such as the Everest (India 1956) ellipsoid and the Indian datum (India, Nepal).
