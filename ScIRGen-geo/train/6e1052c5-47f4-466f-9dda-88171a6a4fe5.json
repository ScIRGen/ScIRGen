            "description": "This daily land surface albedo proudct is with a spatl resolution of 0.02 ° x 0.02 ° over the Tibet Plateau in 2016.  Multi-sensory   data is used to retrieve the  Multisensor Combined BRDF Inversion Model developed from a kernel-driven BRDF model and coupled with  topographic effects, and  prior knowledge is introduced for quality control inversion. The high-precision BRDF / albedo of good spatial-temporal continiuty  is retrieved by combining MODIS reflectance data (a polar orbiting satellite) and  himiwarri-8 AHI  land surface reflectance (a geostationary satellite ). MODIS lans surface reflectance data and AHI TOA reflectance data are downloaded from the official websites. After registration, atmospheric correction and other processing, the daily resolution BRDF is synthesized with a period of 5 days, and then the daily resolution albedo is estimated.  The validation results show that  it meets the accuracy requirements of albedo application. Compared with similar products, it has more advantages in capturing rapidly changing surface features, and has better temporal and spatial continuity. It can effectively support the study of radiation energy balance and environmental change in the Tibet Plateau.",

This approach utilizes a BRDF/albedo model that accounts for the complex topography of the region, enabling accurate estimation of surface albedo by incorporating prior knowledge for quality control and merging polar-orbiting satellite data, such as MODIS reflectance, with geostationary satellite data, such as Himawari-8 AHI surface reflectance, to achieve high precision and spatiotemporal continuity.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of MODIS and AHI satellite data for surface albedo estimation offers advantages in capturing rapid changes in surface characteristics compared to using only one data source. This is due to the combined spatial and temporal resolution provided by both data sources, which results in a more continuous and accurate BRDF/albedo product. The joint use ensures better spatial and temporal continuity, meeting the precision requirements for albedo applications and providing improved detection of rapidly changing surface features.",

This is achieved by using a BRDF/albedo model that integrates coupled terrain factors and collaborates multiple sources of remote sensing data. The dataset employs MODIS and AHI satellite reflectance data, utilizing prior knowledge for quality control and producing temporally continuous, high-resolution albedo products. This approach captures rapidly changing surface characteristics more effectively and ensures better spatio-temporal continuity, supporting research on radiation balance and environmental changes in the region.",
