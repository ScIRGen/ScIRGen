            "description": "The American system classification is used as the standard of soil particle classification. The source data of this data set comes from the soil profile data integrated by the major research plan integration project of Heihe River Basin (soil data integration and soil information product generation of Heihe River Basin, 91325301). The prediction method is mainly based on the soil landscape model. The basic theory of the model is the classic soil genesis theory. The model regards the soil as the product of the comprehensive effects of climate, topography, parent material, biology and time.            \nScope: Heihe River Basin;            \nProjection: WGS · 1984 · Albers;            \nSpatial resolution: 100M;            \nData format: TIFF;            \nData content: spatial distribution of soil clay, silt and sand content            \nPrediction method: enhanced regression tree            \nEnvironmental variables: main soil forming factors",

This method is chosen for its ability to handle complex interactions between soil-forming factors such as climate, topography, parent material, biology, and time. It is particularly useful in modeling the spatial distribution of soil properties like clay, silt, and sand content. Compared to other machine learning methods like random forest or support vector machines, the enhanced regression tree may provide advantages in handling non-linear relationships and variable importance, though specific comparative performance metrics such as accuracy and computational efficiency would depend on the characteristics of the data and the specific implementation of each method.",

These factors interact in intricate ways to influence soil properties, and accurately capturing these interactions requires sophisticated modeling techniques like enhanced regression trees. Additionally, spatial resolution and the accuracy of environmental variables can significantly impact model performance.",

The process considers climate, topography, parent material, biological factors, and time as the interacting factors affecting soil formation. Data is then projected using WGS_1984_Albers with a spatial resolution of 100 meters, and the prediction of clay, silt, and sand content spatial distribution is achieved using the enhanced regression tree method.",
