            "description": "In the first year (from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020), a total of 110 scientific research teams were organized, focusing on more than 60 field scientific investigations in Motuo area, Qilian Mountain and West Tianshan Mountain of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, covering the whole Qinghai Tibet Plateau. By means of infrared camera, transect and sampling point, the authors investigated the vertebrates (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fishes) in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and the agro pastoral insects in the ecotone between agriculture and animal husbandry in the Asian water tower region and Himalaya region. We have completed the first round of field investigation of exotic fish in typical water bodies such as Yarlung Zangbo River, exotic amphibians and reptiles in Lhasa, Nyingchi and Xining city of Qinghai Province, rodents in northern Sichuan Tibet line, and Przewalski gazelle, and carried out and completed the collection of genetic (or histological) samples of some species. This data set contains the information of tissue samples collected during the first year of the scientific expedition. Each folder contains one data set specification table and one or more tissue sample information tables. The information report includes the sub subject number, species, collection place, collection time, collector, sample type, storage method and other information.",

                    "Answer": "Using infrared cameras, transect lines, and sampling points allows for a comprehensive and non-invasive approach to surveying vertebrate animals in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. These methods can enhance the accuracy of detecting elusive or nocturnal species and provide a broad coverage of different habitats. However, the reliance on these methods may introduce challenges such as potential biases in species detection due to camera placement or environmental conditions affecting visibility. Additionally, these methods require careful calibration and validation to ensure comprehensive data collection across the diverse and challenging terrain of the plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Data on vertebrate species and agricultural insects in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were collected using infrared cameras, transect lines, and sample points. These methods were utilized to ensure comprehensive coverage of the region, allowing researchers to gather extensive information across different areas, including the Motuo region, Qilian Mountains, and Western Tianshan. This approach facilitated a thorough investigation of the vertebrate species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as well as agricultural insects in key zones such as the Asian Water Tower and Himalayan agricultural-pastoral interlaced areas.",
