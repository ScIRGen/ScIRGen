            "description": "Land Surface temperature is one of the important parameters of surface energy balance. This dataset is the monthly land surface temperature data of typical stations in Heihe River Basin from June to October in 2020; In flight, DJI M600 Pro UAV was equipped with the WIRIS Pro sc thermal imager. taking SD station in the wetland, DM station in the oasis and Hz station in the desert as the center, the land surface temperature was observed, and the surface brightness temperature image was obtained. The flying height of the UAV was about 300m, the pixel of the thermal imager was 336x256, and the spatial resolution of the image was 0.4m. The surface temperature retrieval algorithm is an improved single channel algorithm, which is applied to the surface brightness temperature data obtained by UAV thermal imager, and finally the land surface temperature data with 0.4 m spatial resolution is obtained.",

                    "Answer": "The method of collecting surface temperature data using a UAV with a thermal camera provides a higher spatial resolution of 0.4m due to the UAV's flight height of approximately 300m and the thermal camera's pixel resolution of 336x256. This allows for detailed surface temperature observations over specific sites like wetlands, oases, and deserts. In contrast, traditional ground-based temperature measurement techniques typically offer lower spatial resolution but may provide higher data accuracy at specific points. The UAV approach uses an improved single-channel algorithm for temperature retrieval, which may introduce variability in data accuracy compared to direct ground measurements.",
