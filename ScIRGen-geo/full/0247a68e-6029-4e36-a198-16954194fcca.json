            "description": "Based on the geostationary satellites and reanalysis data, the China Regional Atmospheric Driving Dataset is a set of atmospheric driving data sets with high spatiotemporal resolution prepared by the China Meteorological Administration, with a spatial resolution of 0.1 ° × 0.1 ° and a temporal resolution of 1 Hours, covering a range of 75 ° -135 ° east longitude and 15 ° -55 ° north latitude, include 6 elements of near-surface temperature, relative humidity, ground pressure, near-surface wind speed, incident solar radiation on the ground, and ground precipitation rate. The preparation process of precipitation products is as follows: The 6-hour cumulative precipitation estimated from the multi-channel data of the China Fengyun-2 geostationary satellite is integrated with the 6-hour cumulative precipitation from conventional ground observations to obtain 6-hour cumulative precipitation spatial distribution data, and then use the high-resolution cloud classification information retrieved from the multi-channel inversion of the geostationary satellites determines the interpolation time weight of the cumulative precipitation and obtains an estimated one-hour cumulative precipitation. The preparation process of the radiation data is as follows: The surface incident solar radiation based on FY-2C, uses the radiation transmission model DISORT (Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer Program for a Multi-Layered Plane-parallel Medium) to calculate the radiation transmission and obtains the data of surface incident solar radiation in China. Preparation process of other elements: The space and time interpolation method is used for the NCEP reanalysis data of 1.0 ° × 1.0 ° to obtain driving factors such as near-surface air temperature, relative humidity, ground pressure, and near-surface wind speed of 0.1 ° × 0.1 ° per hour.\nPhysical meaning of each variable:\nMeteorological Elements || Variable Name || Unit || Physical Meaning\n| Surface temperature || TBOT || K || Surface temperature (2m)\n| Surface pressure || PSRF || Pa || Surface pressure\n| Relative humidity on the ground || RH || kg / kg || Relative humidity near the ground (2m)\n| Wind speed on the ground || WIND || m / s || Wind speed near the ground (anemometer height)\n| Surface incident solar radiation || FSDS || W / m2 || Surface incident solar radiation\n| Precipitation Rate || PRECTmms || mm / hr || Precipitation Rate\nFor more information, see the data documentation published with the data.",

                "Soil moisture plays an important role in land-atmosphere interactions. It is an important geophysical parameter in research on climate, hydrology, agriculture, and forestry. Soil moisture has important climatic effects by influencing ground evapotranspiration, runoff, surface reflectivity, surface emissivity, surface sensible heat, and latent heat flux. At the global scale, the extent of its influence on the atmosphere is second only to that of sea surface temperature. Soil moisture affects matter and energy balances between land and atmosphere through influencing moisture flux, sensible heat, and latent heat flux. Accurate estimates of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture are of vital importance to further understanding the ecological and physical processes of land and land-atmosphere interactions, and are of great importance in the research and application of meteorology in environmental management, ecology, hydrology, and agriculture. Soil moisture information can currently be acquired with the following methods: regular and field observations, satellite remote sensing, and land hydrological modeling and simulation. However, soil moisture observations based on satellite remote sensing are also problematic. Precision of soil moisture inversion is related to soil type, ground surface roughness, and vegetation coverage. The uncertainty in these parameters results in inversion errors and insufficient temporal and spatial resolutions. Soil moisture obtained through land hydrological modeling simulation and calculation has good temporal frequency and spatial distribution. However, its precision is influenced greatly by model structure and input data. Data assimilation methods used currently in atmospheric, marine, and land data assimilation systems include mainly the optimal interpolation method, 3-D variation method, 4-D variation method, Kalman filter, and EnKF. EnKF is an assimilation method used widely in land model assimilation systems, and uses the Monte Carlo method (overall integration method) to calculate predicted error covariance of the state.",
                "Yang et al. [6] developed an automatic rating system used to estimate moisture and energy balances of soil by assimilating AMSR-E vertical polarization 6.9 and 18.7 GHz luminance temperature data. Tian et al. [7–13], Zhang et al. [14, 15], and Jia et. al. [16] researched the improvement of land data assimilation methods and the rating of microwave luminance temperature assimilation observation operator models.",
                "The land surface model is the core of the land data assimilation system. The CLM3.0 model is designed mainly for coupling with the atmospheric numerical model and provides the surface albedo (direct and scattered light within the visible and infrared bands), upward long-wave radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, water vapor flux, and east-to-west and south-to-north surface stress needed by the atmospheric model. One of the difficulties preventing us from improving the land model simulation precision is the lack of long-term, high-resolution, observational atmospheric driving data. The advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) carried by EOS/Aqua is the world's first sensor capable of providing soil moisture service outputs at the global scale."
