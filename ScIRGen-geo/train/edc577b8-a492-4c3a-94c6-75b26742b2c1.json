            "description": "This dataset is derived from the paper: Su, T. et al. (2019). No high tibetan plateau until the Neogene. Science Advances, 5(3), eaav2189. doi:10.1126/sciadv.aav2189\nThis data contains supplementary material of this article.\nResearchers discovered well-preserved palm fossil leaves from the Lunpola Basin (32.033°N, 89.767°E), central Tibetan Plateau at a present elevation of 4655 m in 2016. Researchers compared the newly discovered fossil with those present fossil that are most similar, find that there is no similar leaves among present fossil, therefore, researchers proposed the new species <em>S. tibetensis</em> T. Su et Z.K. Zhou sp. nov. Using the climate model, combined with the research of the fossil, researchers rebuilt the paleoelevation of the central Tibetan Plateau, it shows that a high plateau cannot have existed in the core of Tibet in the Paleogene.\nThe data contains the following tables:\n1) Table S1. Fossil records of palms around the world.\n2) Table S2. Morphological comparisons between fossils from Lunpola Basin and modern palm genera.\n3) Table S3. Climate ranges of 12 living genera that show the closest morphological similarity to <em>S. tibetensis</em> T. Su et Z.K. Zhou sp. nov.\nThis dataset also contains the figures in the supplementary material in the article.",

                    "Answer": "The discovery of well-preserved palm fossils in the central Tibetan Plateau, particularly in the Lunpola Basin, necessitated the development of methodologies that could accurately collect and compare these fossils with existing records. The need to establish a new species, Sabalites tibensis, due to its distinct morphology compared to existing palm fossils, also led to the development of specific data collection techniques. Additionally, the integration of palm fossil data with paleoclimate models to reconstruct paleoaltitudes of the Tibetan Plateau before the Neogene period further influenced the data collection methods employed.",
