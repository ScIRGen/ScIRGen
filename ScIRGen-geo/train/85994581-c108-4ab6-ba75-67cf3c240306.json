            "description": "The dataset of soil moisture observations (VWC%) was obtained at the super site (100m×100m) around the Dayekou Guantan forest station on Jun. 5, 2008. The super site was divided into 16 subplots (25m×25m). 10 points were measured by TDR 300 (with the probe 20cm long) at random location in each subplot. The serial number and the cover type of the subplot, the number of the sample points and soil moisture (%) were recorded.\n     Those provide reliable data for the construction of the 3D structure of the forest scene, and for the modeling of active and passive remote sensing mechanisms and the simulation of remote sensing images.",

                    "Answer": "Using a 20cm probe length with a TDR 300 soil moisture meter can affect the accuracy and reliability of soil moisture data by influencing the measurement depth and volume. This depth may provide a representative sample of the topsoil moisture but may not capture variations deeper in the soil profile. Additionally, the probe's depth could be affected by the presence of roots or other underground obstructions common in forested areas, potentially leading to variability in readings.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of collecting soil moisture data at multiple points within a forested area using TDR technology include understanding the spatial variability of soil moisture, which can aid in the reconstruction of 3D forest scenes, establishment of active and passive remote sensing mechanism models, and simulation of remote sensing imagery. These objectives contribute to broader research goals by providing detailed data that enhance the accuracy and applicability of remote sensing techniques in forest hydrometeorological studies.",
