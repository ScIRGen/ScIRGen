            "description": "The basic data of hydrometeorology, land use and DEM were collected through the National Meteorological Information Center, the Hydrological Yearbook, the China Statistical Yearbook and the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The distributed time-varying gain hydrological model with independent intellectual property rights is used for modeling, and the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is divided into 10937 sub basins with a threshold of 100 square kilometers. In Heihe River, Yarlung Zangbo River, the source of Yangtze River, the source of Yellow River, Yalong River, Minjiang River and Lancang River basins, 14 flow stations were selected to observe the daily flow data to develop and verify the model. The daily scale Naxi efficiency coefficient is above 0.7, and the correlation coefficient is above 0.8. The precipitation and temperature data output from 13 models and 4 scenarios provided by CMIP6 are used to post process the future precipitation and temperature data. The post processed precipitation and temperature driven hydrological model simulates the water cycle process from 2046 to 2065, and gives the possible future spatial and temporal distribution of 0.1 degree daily scale runoff across the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

It incorporates spatially distributed parameters and time-varying gain factors to model water resource distribution across different sub-basins, allowing for detailed simulation and prediction of hydrological data, such as runoff, under various scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "The use of distributed time-varying gain hydrological models allows for detailed simulation and interpretation of future spatial-temporal water distribution patterns. By dividing the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into 10,937 sub-basins, these models can capture the complex interactions between hydrological processes and climate variables provided by CMIP6 models. The application ensures that the daily flow data from 14 selected flow stations, with efficiency coefficients reaching 0.7 and correlation coefficients above 0.8, are accurately integrated into the model. This approach enhances the ability to interpret how changes in precipitation and temperature due to different RCP scenarios might affect water distribution across the Plateau from 2046 to 2065.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in modeling water resources distribution across the Tibetan Plateau under different RCP scenarios arise from the need to integrate diverse sources of data such as hydrometeorological data, land use information, and digital elevation models. Additionally, the complex topography and climate variability of the region require robust models like the distributed time-varying gain hydrological model. The accuracy of future projections also depends on the effective post-processing of precipitation and temperature data from multiple CMIP6 models and scenarios, which are used to drive the hydrological models.",

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is divided into 10,937 sub-basins using a 100 square kilometer threshold. Daily flow data from 14 flow stations in various river basins are used to calibrate and validate the model, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of over 0.7 and a correlation coefficient of over 0.8. Additionally, precipitation and temperature data from 13 models under four scenarios provided by CMIP6 are post-processed to drive the hydrological model, simulating the water cycle process for 2046-2065 and predicting possible future spatial and temporal distribution of runoff across the plateau on a 0.1-degree daily scale.",
