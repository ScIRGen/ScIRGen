            "description": "The aeolian sediments in the southern Tibetan Plateau record climate changes during geological history, providing us with a valuable geological carrier on a long-term scale to understand the current and future environmental evolution of the plateau and surrounding areas. However, due to the lack of sedimentary records with good dating results, our understanding of the Holocene climate change in the southern Tibetan Plateau is still very limited. This data set provides the chronological, environmental magnetic, geochemical and grain size data of two typical Holocene eolian sedimentary profiles (Hangzhong HZ profile and Sagaxi SGX profile) with good dating in the middle and upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River in the southern Tibetan Plateau. Among them, the photoluminescence age was determined using the Risø TL/OSL DA-20C/D photoluminescence analyzer; The magnetic susceptibility was measured using the Bartington MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter, the hysteresis free remanence was measured using the LDA-5 alternating demagnetization meter and the JR-6A rotating magnetometer, and the isothermal remanence was measured using the ASCIM-10-30 pulse magnetometer and the JR-6A rotating magnetometer; Elements were measured using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer; The particle size was measured using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser particle size analyzer. This dataset is rich in content, and the data results clarify the climatic significance of environmental indicators for aeolian sediments in the southern Tibetan Plateau, further revealing the Holocene climate change in the Asian Water Tower region and its inherent connection with atmospheric circulation.

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is regarded as the “Asian Water Tower” because it is the source of most of the major rivers in Asia. Glaciers and lakes are widely distributed in the southern TP, which feed many major Asian rivers, such as the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus, and thus they are critically important for the large human populations downstream. Recent studies have indicated that landscape attributes in the southern TP, such as glaciers, lakes, and vegetation, have changed rapidly over the past 30 years. These landscape changes are closely related to changes in precipitation delivered by the regional atmospheric circulation systems. Compilations of various paleo-moisture proxies suggest that the pattern of moisture evolution in the southern TP was characterized by a wet early Holocene and a dry late Holocene, which was attributed to the role of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). However, these inferred moisture changes during the Holocene are inconsistent with pollen-based precipitation reconstructions from the same latitude in the southern TP. This conflicting pattern of inferred moisture evolution may result from two factors. First, the region is located at the junction of the ISM and the MLW, and thus changes in moisture conditions may be influenced by both atmospheric systems. Second, differences between records may be caused by the use of different dating methods and proxies."

However, at ~7.6 ka the climate abruptly became drier, probably due to the weakening of the ISM. Subsequently, with the further decrease in summer insolation and increase in winter insolation, the variations in ISM-related moisture delivery to the southern TP were regulated by the enhanced winter mid-latitude Westerlies (MLW), resulting in increasing weathering intensity. Thus, the Holocene evolution of moisture conditions in the southern TP was mainly controlled by changes in the relative intensities of the ISM and the winter MLW, which depended on the variations of summer and winter insolation."
