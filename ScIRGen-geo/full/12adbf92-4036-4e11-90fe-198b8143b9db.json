The observation accuracy of evapotranspiration is 0.01mm.Two evapotranspiration seeptometers were installed, one kept bare soil (lysimeter_1), the other for the corn underlay (lysimeter_2) during the growing season (May 10 - September 15).Soil temperature and humidity probe, soil water potential probe and soil heat flow plate are also installed in the evapotranspiration apparatus.The buried depth of the soil temperature sensor is 5cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm and 140cm.The buried depth of the soil water sensor is 2cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm.The soil heat flux plate is buried 10cm underground;The buried depth of the soil water potential sensor was 30cm and 140cm.Processing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) delete the data of observation anomalies caused during maintenance;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the format of date and time is unified, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2016-6-10-10:30.\nThe observation data released by the evapotranspiration permeameter include:Date/Time, weighing mass (i.l._1_wag_l_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_l_000 (Kg)), seepage mass (i.l._1_wag_d_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_d_000 (Kg)), soil heat flux (Gs_1_10cm, Gs_2_10cm) (W/m2),Multi-layer soil moisture (Ms_1_5cm, Ms_1_10cm, Ms_1_30cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_100cm, Ms_2_5cm, Ms_2_10cm, Ms_2_30cm, Ms_2_50cm, Ms_2_100cm) (%),Multi-layer soil temperature (Ts_1_5cm, Ts_1_30cm, Ts_1_50cm, Ts_1_100cm, Ts_1_140cm, Ts_2_140cm, ts_2_2_5cm, ts_2_2_50cm, Ts_2_100cm, Ts_2_140cm) (℃), soil water potential (TS_1_30 (hPa), TS_1_140 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa));The data is stored in *.xls format.",

The relationship between field evapotranspiration and meteorological factors (net radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed), soil moisture has been studied through multiple regression analysis method. Lysimeter’s representativeness was significantly affected by the growth of the crops within it. As heat can not be exchanged between the soil in lysimeter and the soil outside, the average temperature of the soil in the lysimeter is 9.5% higher than that of the field outside."

It calculates soil evaporation, crop evapotranspiration, rainfall, and leakage during the corn growing season. By combining meteorological factors, it explores the daily and seasonal variation patterns of soil evaporation and crop evapotranspiration. Additionally, it compares and analyzes the observation results of evapotranspiration from the eddy covariance instrument and the evaporation and infiltration instrument to verify the representativeness of the latter. It also preliminarily analyzes the reasons for the differences between the two, providing a reference for future research on agricultural irrigation decision-making and water-saving in agriculture."

            "challenges": [
                "The evaporation and infiltration instrument is a single-point observation tool with a relatively small observation range, thus its spatial representativeness is limited. Therefore, it is essential to verify whether the observation results of the evaporation and infiltration instrument can represent the evapotranspiration values of farmland within the regional scope. Even after energy closure correction, the evapotranspiration measured by the eddy covariance instrument is lower than that of the evaporation and infiltration instrument, which shows an overestimation phenomenon. Strong Xiaoman and others believe that the evaporation and infiltration instrument isolates the water and heat exchange with the surrounding farmland, leading to differences in soil moisture supply and heat exchange within the instrument compared to the surrounding farmland, which may result in the overestimation of evapotranspiration by the evaporation and infiltration instrument."

                "To study the variation characteristics of farmland evapotranspiration in the North China region, a multi-scale evapotranspiration observation system was set up in the study area. The experimental area is divided into irrigated land and dry land by the red line shown in the figure. A 10 m meteorological tower and a 40 m meteorological tower were installed in both the irrigated land and dry land, equipped with automatic weather stations and eddy covariance instruments. The soil moisture and energy balance systems were installed at the 10 m meteorological tower located in the irrigated land. According to the experimental requirements, one of the two soil moisture instruments was kept bare, serving as a comparison, while the other was planted with corn. To ensure that the growth conditions of the corn in the soil moisture instrument were consistent with those of the surrounding farmland corn during the experiment, corn of the variety Zhengdan 958 was planted on one of the soil moisture instruments on May 5, 2012, and May 10, 2013. The sowing time, row spacing, and plant spacing were consistent with those of the surrounding farmland, and regular weeding was conducted in the soil moisture instrument to ensure that the growth of corn inside was as consistent as possible with that of the surrounding farmland."

The correlativity between evapotranspiration measured by EC and that by lysimeter is very good. The value of lysimeter is 10.5% higher than that of EC.
