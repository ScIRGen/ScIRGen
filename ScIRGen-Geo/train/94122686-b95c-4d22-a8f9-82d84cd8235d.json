      "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Sidaoqiao Superstation (two sites) in the hydrometeorological observation network of Heihe River Basin. There were two types of LASs at site 1: German BLS900 and Netherlands Kipp&zonen. The north tower was set up with the BLS900/Kipp&zonen receiver, and the south tower was equipped with the BLS900/Kipp&zonen transmitter. The observation period of BLS900_1 and Kipp&zonen were from 11 July to 13 November, 2013, and 11 July to 12 September, 2013, respectively. There was one type of LAS at site 2: German BLS900. The north tower was set up with the BLS900 receiver, and the south tower was equipped with the BLS900 transmitter. BLS900_2 has been in use since 16 September, 2013. The Sidaoqiao Superstation (site1, north: 101.147° E, 42.005° N, south: 101.131° E, 41.987° N; site 2, north: 101.137° E, 42.008° N, south: 101.121° E, 41.990° N) was located in Ejinaqi, Inner Mongolia. The underlying surfaces between the two towers were tamarisk, populus, bare land and farmland. The elevation is 873 m. The effective height of the LASs was 25.5 m, and the path length of site 1 and site 2 were 2390 m and 2380 m, respectively. The data were sampled at 5 Hz and 1 Hz intervals for BLS900 and zzlas, respectively, and then averaged over 1 min.\nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 exceeded the saturated criterion (BLS900_1: Cn2>7.25E-14, Kipp&zonen: Cn2>7.84E-14, BLS900_2: Cn2>7.33E-14). (2) The data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS900: Average X Intensity<1000; Kipp&zonen: Demod>-20mv). (3) The data were rejected when collected during precipitation. (4) The data were rejected if collected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). In the iteration process, the universal functions of Thiermann and Grassl, 1992 and Andreas, 1988 were selected for BLS900 and Kipp&zonen, respectively.\nSeveral instructions were included with the released data. (1) The data of site 1 were primarily obtained from BLS900_1 measurements, and missing flux measurements from the BLS900_1 instrument were substituted with measurements from the Kipp&zonen instrument. The missing data were denoted by -6999. The data of site 2 were obtained from BLS900_2 measurements, missing data were denoted by -6999. Due to the problems of BLS900_1 transmitter, the data after 13 November, 2013, were not collected. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: data/time (yyyy-m-d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H_LAS, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xls format. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red. \nFor more information, please refer to Li et al. (2013) (for hydrometeorological observation network or sites information), Liu et al.

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
        "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
        "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

The soil and canopy component temperatures were calculated using the images obtained with the thermal camera. To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities. Next, the simulated radiometric temperatures were validated against the surface radiometric temperatures, which were calculated according to the incoming long-wave radiation observed by the four-component radiometer."

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
