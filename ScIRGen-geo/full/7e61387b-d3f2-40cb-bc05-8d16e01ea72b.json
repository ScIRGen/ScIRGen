                "Accurate global and regional land cover data is an important foundation for studying terrestrial surface processes. In the context of the rise of integrated research and the coexistence of various data, using multi-source information fusion technology for large-scale land cover mapping has significant practical implications. Evidence theory clearly expresses the \"ignorance\" regarding propositions due to uncertain and incomplete information, and it can determine the degree of certainty, uncertainty, and \"ignorance\" of corresponding hypotheses under the current state of cognition and knowledge, making it an important method for multi-source data decision fusion. Changes in land cover will affect the structure and function of ecosystems and a series of other terrestrial surface processes, such as energy exchange, water cycle, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation productivity. The increasingly in-depth research on global surface processes requires the identification of various land cover types and their characteristic parameters, many of which are defined by land cover types, such as many time-invariant parameters in models like SIB2 and CoLM (e.g., vegetation albedo, canopy roughness, and canopy zero-plane displacement) that depend on land cover types. Due to the significant importance of land cover data, countries around the world and many international organizations have successively employed different image processing technologies and data, such as Landsat 7, AVHRR, SPOT 4 VEGETATION, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra and Aqua satellites of the EOS program, to conduct remote sensing studies on land use and land cover at regional, intercontinental, and global scales. This has resulted in a series of land cover data, such as IGBP DISCover, the University of Maryland, GLC2000, and the quarterly updated global land cover data products from MODIS. Ran evaluated and compared the accuracy of several existing global land cover datasets for the terrestrial portion of China and concluded that none meet the needs for simulating land surface processes in China. In China, a large number of land cover-related projects have been carried out, yielding many valuable datasets, such as the national land resource survey primarily using remote sensing methods organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences during the \"Eighth Five-Year Plan\" and \"Ninth Five-Year Plan,\" which established a national 1:100,000 land use database, as well as China's 1:1,000,000 vegetation map, 1:100,000 glacier map, and 1:1,000,000 wetland map, among others. The data resources related to land cover are very rich, but none of these datasets can fully reflect the complete picture of land cover, as their purposes vary, with China's land use mapping primarily aimed at national resource surveys, etc."

            "research objective": [
                "This article is based on evidence theory and collects various land cover-related data within China. Through reasoning and decision-making, it develops a more accurate representation of the IGBP land cover classification system for the land cover status in China in the year 2000. This article uses the IGBP classification system to create land cover classification maps for China. The integration work aims to improve the accuracy of regional land cover maps in China by incorporating long-accumulated local land cover survey data."

            "challenges": [
                "The uncertainty interval for most pixels in the fusion results is between 0 and 0.1, with only a few pixels having an uncertainty interval exceeding 0.4. Moreover, areas with high uncertainty are mainly distributed in mountainous regions, which may indicate the complex climate environment in these areas leading to diverse land cover types. This also reflects that eliminating the influence of mountainous terrain in remote sensing data during the land cover classification process is still an area that requires further research."

            "methods": [
                "Based on evidence theory, the 1:100,000 land use data from China in 2000, the vegetation classification from the China Vegetation Atlas (1:1,000,000), the 1:100,000 glacier map of China, the 1:1,000,000 wetland map, and the MODIS 2001 land cover product (MOD12Q1) were integrated. Ultimately, a new land cover dataset for China in 2000, based on the IGBP classification system, was produced using the principle of maximum trustworthiness for decision-making. We made corrections without altering the relative accuracy of each type, ensuring that the basic probability assignments did not contain particularly extreme values. The final basic probability assignments are shown in Table 4. We unified the classification systems of the two datasets into a comprehensive 7-class system and conducted analyses based on area and spatial consistency."

                "Five types of data are used as evidence input into the decision-making system for fusion, including the MODIS global land cover data product from 2001 (MOD12Q1), the vegetation types from the China Vegetation Atlas (1:1,000,000), the 2000 China 1 km land use classification map derived from the China 1:100,000 land use database, the China 1:100,000 glacier map, and the China 1:1,000,000 wetland map. Each of these five data types has its own characteristics and provides complementary information. The MODIS global land cover data product offers a globally consistent and universally applicable land cover classification system. The China 1 km land use map is derived from the China 1:100,000 land use database, which was created through merging and raster-vector conversion (maximum area method). The China 1:100,000 land use database is based on Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM remote sensing images, primarily interpreted visually by experts across the country based on their understanding of image spectra, texture, tone, etc., combined with topographic maps. The database has been validated through field surveys, achieving an accuracy of 95%. The China 1:1,000,000 vegetation type classification map complements the missing information in the land use data; it is compiled from rich firsthand data accumulated from vegetation surveys conducted nationwide over the past half-century, utilizing modern technologies such as aerial remote sensing and satellite imagery, along with the latest research findings in geology, soil science, and climatology. It provides a detailed reflection of the distribution patterns, horizontal zonation, and vertical zonation of 796 vegetation units across 11 vegetation type groups and 54 vegetation types in China. The China 1:100,000 glacier map and the China 1:1,000,000 wetland map provide precise distribution information for glaciers and wetlands."

The classification system adopted the IGBP classification system, making it more universal. The consistency of the fusion results with the MODIS 2001 land cover product reached 47.59%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.38; the consistency with the IGBP DISCover reached 40.2%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.31."

                    "Answer": "In the context of data fusion for land cover mapping, 'evidence theory' refers to a method for integrating multiple sources of information to make decisions about land cover types. It is used to express the uncertainty and partial knowledge about propositions due to incomplete or uncertain information. This theory helps determine the certainty, uncertainty, and ignorance levels of certain hypotheses given the current state of knowledge, making it an important method for decision-making with multi-source data.",

High uncertainty areas were mostly found in mountainous regions. To address these challenges, the fusion process involved carefully assigning basic probabilities and unifying different classification systems into a coherent seven-class system. Although uncertainties remained, particularly due to topographic influences on remote sensing data, these were minimized by maintaining high accuracy levels in the original data types.",
