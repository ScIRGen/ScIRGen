                "As a key parameter in hydrological cycle, soil moisture plays an important role in the hydrological processes such as infiltration, runoff and evapotranspiration. It is also a direct indicator for flood and drought monitoring and serves as a critical variable in flood modelling and drought assessment. Soil moisture governs the partitioning of the water, energy and carbon exchanges between the land-atmosphere. Traditionally, ground-based soil moisture can be measured by the gravimetric method, which is still widely used as it is the only direct (accurate) way of measuring soil moisture. Remote sensing technology, especially the development of microwave remote sensing, has made it possible to measure and monitor soil moisture over large areas. With the launch of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellites, L-band radiometry from space have become the most effective means of measuring soil moisture at the global scale. These experiments have also played a significant role in promoting the development of remote sensing, soil science, hydrology and other related disciplines to address a very broad science questions beyond soil moisture, and it is pivotal for calibration/validation studies before and after the mission launch."

This proposed mission is targeted to provide continuity for the current satellite L-band microwave observations, and further improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active, passive and optical remote sensing data."

The near surface soil moisture (0 cm–5 cm) was measured extensively on the ground in fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats (targeted to compare with the airborne radiometer), and two hundred and fifty 200 m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations. Two networks were established for continuous measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm) and precipitation in the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin, respectively. Supporting ground measurements also included ground temperature, vegetation water content, surface roughness, continuous measurement of microwave emission and backscatter at a pasture site, reflectance of various land cover types, evapotranspiration and aerosol observations."

(2) The difference of soil and vegetation temperature in grass and croplands reach its maximum of 11 K around solar noon time, and the soil temperature gradient is largest at around 15 P.M.
