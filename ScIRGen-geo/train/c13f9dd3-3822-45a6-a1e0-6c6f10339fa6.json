            "description": "This dataset includes the observation data from 01 Jan. 2019 through 31 Dec. 2018, collected by lysimeters, which are located at 115.788 E, 40.349 N and 480 m above sea level, near the Huailai Station in East Garden Town, Huailai County, Hebei Province. The land cover around the station was maize crop. \nThe weighable lysimeter was built by UMS GmbH (Germany), with a surface area of 1m2, and a soil column of 1.5 m high. The original data sampling frequency was 1 Hz, and then averaged to 10min for distribution. The precision of the weighing data is 10g (equivalent to 0.01mm). During the crop growth period, a lysimeter is covered by bare soil and another one is covered by planted maize. The soil moisture, temperature and soil water potential sensors are installed both inside and outside of the lysimeter to ensure that the water cycle in the soil column is consistent with that of the field. Different sensors are located at different depths: 5, 50, 100 cm for soil temperature sensors, and 5, 10, 30, 50, 100 cm for soil moisture sensors, and 30 and 140cm for soil water potential sensors (the tensionmeter here can also measure soil temperature at 30, 140 cm). The soil heat flux plates in both lysimeters are buried at 10cm depth.\nThe data processes and quality control according to: 1) ensuring there were 144 data every day, the lost data were replaced by -6999; 2) deleting the abnormal data; 3) deleting the outlier data; 4) keeping the consistent date and time format (e.g.2018-6-10 10:30).\nThe distributed data include the following variables: Date-Time, Weight (I.L_1_WAG_L_000(Kg), I.L_2_WAG_L_000(Kg)), Drainage Weight (I.L_1_WAG_D_000(Kg), I.L_2_WAG_D_000(Kg)), Soil Heat Flux (Gs_1_10cm, Gs_2_10cm) (W/m2), Soil Moisture (Ms_1_5cm, Ms_1_10cm, Ms_1_30cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_100cm, Ms_2_5cm, Ms_2_10cm, Ms_2_30cm, Ms_2_50cm, Ms_2_100cm) (%), Soil Temperature (Ts_1_5cm , Ts_1_30cm, Ts_1_50cm, Ts_1_100cm, Ts_1_140cm, Ts_2_5cm , Ts_2_30cm, Ts_2_50cm, Ts_2_100cm, Ts_2_140cm) (C), Soil Water Potential (TS_1_30(hPa), TS_1_140(hPa), TS_2_30(hPa), TS_2_140(hPa)). The format of datasets was *.xls.",

                    "Answer": "A lysimeter is a cylindrical structure used to measure evapotranspiration and other soil-related variables. It operates by monitoring the weight changes of a soil column to determine water loss or gain. The lysimeter in this context is used to collect meteorological and soil data, including soil moisture, temperature, and heat flux, with high precision and frequency. It involves sensors at various depths to capture comprehensive soil profiles.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using lysimeters with soil temperature and moisture sensors offers high precision in measuring evapotranspiration by directly measuring weight changes and other soil parameters at multiple depths. This method allows for detailed analysis of soil conditions under different surface covers, such as bare soil and crops like corn, providing specific insights into soil-plant-atmosphere interactions. Other meteorological data collection methods, like remote sensing or eddy covariance, may cover larger areas but often provide less detailed soil-specific data and rely on indirect measurements to estimate evapotranspiration.",
