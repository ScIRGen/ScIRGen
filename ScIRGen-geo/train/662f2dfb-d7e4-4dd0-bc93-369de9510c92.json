The observation accuracy of evapotranspiration is 0.01mm.Two evapotranspiration seeptometers were installed, one kept bare soil (lysimeter_1), the other for the corn underlay (lysimeter_2) during the growing season (May 10 - September 15).Soil temperature and humidity probe, soil water potential probe and soil heat flow plate are also installed in the evapotranspiration apparatus.The buried depth of the soil temperature sensor is 5cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm and 140cm.The buried depth of the soil water sensor is 2cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm.The soil heat flux plate is buried 10cm underground;The buried depth of the soil water potential sensor was 30cm and 140cm.Processing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min).

The relationship between field evapotranspiration and meteorological factors (net radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed), soil moisture has been studied through multiple regression analysis method. Lysimeter’s representativeness was significantly affected by the growth of the crops within it. As heat can not be exchanged between the soil in lysimeter and the soil outside, the average temperature of the soil in the lysimeter is 9.5% higher than that of the field outside."

It calculates soil evaporation, crop evapotranspiration, rainfall, and leakage during the corn growing season. By combining meteorological factors, it explores the daily and seasonal variation patterns of soil evaporation and crop evapotranspiration. Additionally, it compares and analyzes the observation results of evapotranspiration from the eddy covariance instrument and the evaporation and infiltration instrument to verify the representativeness of the latter. It also preliminarily analyzes the reasons for the differences between the two, providing a reference for future research on agricultural irrigation decision-making and water-saving in agriculture."

Therefore, it is essential to verify whether the observation results of the evaporation and infiltration instrument can represent the evapotranspiration values of farmland within the regional scope. Even after energy closure correction, the evapotranspiration measured by the eddy covariance instrument is lower than that of the evaporation and infiltration instrument, which shows an overestimation phenomenon. Strong Xiaoman and others believe that the evaporation and infiltration instrument interrupts the water and heat exchange with the surrounding farmland, leading to differences in soil moisture supply and heat exchange within the instrument compared to the surrounding farmland, which may cause the overestimation of evapotranspiration by the evaporation and infiltration instrument."

The experimental area is divided into irrigated land and dry land by the red line shown in the figure. Both the irrigated land and dry land are equipped with a 10 m meteorological tower and a 40 m meteorological tower, which are installed with automatic weather stations and eddy covariance instruments. The soil moisture and energy balance systems are installed at the 10 m meteorological tower located in the irrigated land. According to the experimental requirements, one of the two soil moisture instruments remains bare soil for comparison, while the other is planted with corn. To ensure that the growth conditions of corn in the soil moisture instrument are consistent with those of the surrounding farmland corn during the experiment, corn of the variety Zhengdan 958 was planted on one of the soil moisture instruments on May 5, 2012, and May 10, 2013, with the same sowing time, row spacing, and plant spacing as the surrounding farmland. Additionally, regular weeding was conducted in the soil moisture instrument to ensure that the growth of corn inside the instrument was as consistent as possible with that of the surrounding farmland."

                    "Answer": "The presence of crops within a lysimeter affects the accuracy of evapotranspiration measurements because it disrupts the natural exchange of heat and moisture with the environment, causing the soil inside the lysimeter to have a higher average temperature by 9.5% compared to the outside field. This can result in an overestimation of evapotranspiration values when compared to measurements from eddy covariance systems.",

                    "Answer": "Using different data collection systems like lysimeters and eddy covariance can lead to discrepancies in observed evapotranspiration values. For instance, lysimeter measurements tend to be higher than those from eddy covariance due to the lack of heat exchange with surrounding soil, which can affect water and heat supply dynamics. Despite energy closure corrections, eddy covariance might report lower evapotranspiration, highlighting the need for cross-verification and understanding the systematic differences between the methods.",
