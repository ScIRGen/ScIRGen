            "description": "The application of general circulation models (GCMs) can improve our understanding of climate forcing. In addition, longer climate records and a wider range of climate states can help assess the ability of the models to simulate climate differences from the present. First, we try to find a substitute index that combines the effects of temperature in different seasons and then combine it with the Beijing stalagmite layer sequence and the Qilian tree-ring sequence to carry out a large-scale temperature reconstruction of China over the past millennium. We then compare the results with the simulated temperature record based on a GCM and ECH-G for the past millennium. Based on the 31-year average, the correlation coefficient between the simulated and reconstructed temperature records was 0.61 (with P < 0.01). The asymmetric V-type low-frequency variation revealed by the combination of the substitute index and the simulation series is the main long-term model of China's millennium-scale temperature. Therefore, solar irradiance and greenhouse gases can account for most of the low-frequency variation. To preserve low-frequency information, conservative detrended methods were used to eliminate age-related growth trends in the experiment. Each tree-ring series has a negative exponential curve installed while retaining all changes.\nThe four fields of the combined 1000-yr (1000 AD-2000 AD) reconstructed temperature records derived from stalagmite and tree-ring archives (excel table) are as follows:\n1) Year\n2) Annual average temperature reconstruction\n3) Reconstructed temperature deviation\n4) Simulated temperature deviation",

                    "Answer": "A proxy indicator in the context of climate data reconstruction refers to natural recorders such as tree rings and stalagmites that provide indirect evidence of past climate conditions, specifically temperature variations. These proxies are used to reconstruct historical climate data by analyzing the physical and chemical properties recorded over time.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for temperature reconstructions using stalagmite sequences and tree ring sequences differ in their ability to capture seasonal temperature variations. Stalagmite sequences can integrate various seasonal signals due to their continuous deposition, whereas tree rings typically capture temperature variations during the growing season. In the study, a combination of both proxies was used to reconstruct large-scale temperature patterns for the past millennium in China, suggesting a complementary approach to capture different seasonal influences.",

                    "Answer": "The correlation coefficient of 0.61 between the reconstructed and simulated temperature records suggests a moderate relationship, indicating that the proxy indicators like stalagmites and tree rings capture significant aspects of past climate variability. The asymmetric V-shaped low-frequency changes observed imply that natural factors like solar irradiance and greenhouse gas concentrations could explain a considerable portion of these long-term temperature variations. The use of conservative detrending methods to remove growth trends while preserving low-frequency information supports the validity of these inferences.",

Moreover, the need to preserve low-frequency information necessitates a conservative detrending method to eliminate age-related growth trends, which can affect the accuracy of the temperature reconstructions.",

This approach can result in a significant correlation between reconstructed and simulated temperature records, as indicated by a correlation coefficient of 0.61 over a 31-year average, which suggests that the method captures low-frequency changes effectively, reflecting major long-term temperature patterns driven by factors like solar irradiance and greenhouse gases.",

The combination of these proxies is crucial for large-scale temperature reconstructions over the past millennium. The process includes comparing the reconstructed temperature data with simulation records from GCM-based models like ECH-G. The correlation coefficient between these records, over a 31-year average, was found to be 0.61, indicating the alignment of reconstructed and simulated temperature data. To ensure that low-frequency information is preserved, a conservative detrending method is used to remove age-related growth trends from each tree-ring series, fitting a negative exponential curve while maintaining all variations.",
