            "description": "The data are the radioactive isotope dating data, mineral isotope composition data and seismic wave velocity data of metamorphic rocks in the lower crust. The samples were collected from Cenozoic basalts and felsic granulite, neutral granulite and basic granulite xenoliths in Nushan area, Anhui Province, southeastern North China Craton. The U-Pb isotopic data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data of mineral isotopic composition were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Rock seismic wave data are estimated by binocular lens and calculated by empirical formula. The obtained data reconstruct the fine structure and evolution of the lower crust in the southeastern margin of North China.",
