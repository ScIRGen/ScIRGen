            "description": "In this study, glacial lakes were defined as water bodies primarily fed by contemporary glacier meltwater within a 10 km glacier buffer zone. We manually delineated the glacial lakes globally in two time windows, 1990 and 2020, using a total of 1255 Sentinel-2A/B (10 m) and 765 Landsat (30 m) images. These images were selected with acquisition times in the late period of regional glacial ablation and with a cloud coverage of less than 10%. The minimum extraction threshold was set at 0.002 km2.",

                    "Answer": "Accurately mapping glacier-fed lakes using satellite imagery is challenging due to factors such as cloud coverage, which must be less than 10% for effective observation. Additionally, the need to manually delineate lakes from images requires high-resolution data, as facilitated by 10-meter Sentinel-2A/B and 30-meter Landsat images, to ensure precision. The selection of images during the regional glacier melting period also plays a critical role in capturing the accurate extent of these lakes.",
