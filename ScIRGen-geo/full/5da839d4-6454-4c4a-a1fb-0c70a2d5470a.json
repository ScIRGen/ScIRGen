            "description": "This dataset contains 30m 5-yearly land cover maps in Qilian Mountain Area from 1990 to 2020. The dataset is produced mainly using 30m Landsat series data of long time series, and has the following characteristics: 1) high precision for using geographical division and hierarchical classification decision tree strategy, cooperating with visual interpretation; 2) good consistency for using change detection method based on benchmark map; 3) high production efficiency for main operations are carried out on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. This dataset includes 9 categories, including cropland, forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, water bodies, impervious surface, bareland, and snow&ice, with an overall accuracy of over 90%.",
