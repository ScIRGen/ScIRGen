            "description": "This data set contains the biological property data of soil samples from several scientific research routes in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau from 2019 to 2021, including the information of the collector, collection time, collection location, longitude and latitude, altitude, vegetation type, sampling depth, phosphatase activity, microbial respiration, nitrogen transformation characteristics, functional gene abundance, fungi, bacteria, protobiotic diversity, etc. The analysis of various soil properties refers to the requirements of \"technical specification for soil environmental quality monitoring\", and the first-hand data obtained through laboratory analysis. The data quality is controlled by determining blank samples, duplicate samples and standard samples. The data set can be used to evaluate soil quality and function under the influence of climate change and human activities.",

The analysis includes determining soil biological properties such as phosphatase activity, microbial respiration, nitrogen transformation characteristics, functional gene abundance, and the diversity of fungi, bacteria, and protists. These analyses adhere to the 'Soil Environmental Quality Monitoring Technical Specifications' through laboratory testing. Data quality is controlled by measuring blank samples, duplicate samples, and standard samples.",
