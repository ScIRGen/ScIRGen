                "The snow water equivalent (SWE) is an important parameter of surface hydrological and climate systems, and it has a profound impact on Arctic amplification and climate change. In most land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, annual runoff is dominated by snowmelt, and accurately estimating the impacts of such a large amount of snowmelt runoff on ecosystems and human activities is of great significance. At present, there are many forms of SWE data in the world. However, the time ranges of AMSR-E and AMSR-E2 SWE are only from 2003 to the present, which is lacking in terms of time series. Although the reanalysis SWE data have good spatial and temporal continuity and high data integrity, their accuracy is poor, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.65. There are great differences among remote sensing SWE, reanalysis SWE data, data assimilation SWE, and observational SWE. In summary, although there are a variety of SWE data in the world, the data quality is uncertain. Previous studies have shown that all kinds of SWE data in the Northern Hemisphere have advantages and disadvantages, and none of these data perform well in all aspects. Many scholars have conducted in-depth studies on SWE data fusion. Studies have shown that even the simplest multisource data average is more accurate than a single SWE product. In summary, based on the existing SWE data products, combining a machine learning algorithm to fuse multisource SWE data is an effective method to prepare SWE products with long time series and large spatial scales and retain the advantages of single SWE data products."
