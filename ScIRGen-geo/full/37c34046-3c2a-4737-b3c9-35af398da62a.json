            "description": "Rainfall erosivity is one of the important basic data to quantify soil erosion in the Tibet Plateau. High precision rainfall erosivity data is the key to understand the current situation of soil and water loss in theTibet Plateau and formulate soil and water conservation measures. Meanwhile, it can provide a powerful reference for the prevention and control of geological disasters in the Tibet Plateau. Based on the 1-min dense precipitation observations and the grid precipitation product, a new annual rainfall erosivity dataset in Tibet Plateau from 1950 to 2020 is constructed through the steps of correction, reconstruction and validation. This dataset is the rainfall erosivity data set with the highest accuracy and the longest time series in the Tibet Plateau.",

                "The risk of water erosion on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), a typical fragile ecological area, is increasing with climate change. Precipitation is the main driver of water erosion because it directly affects the detachment of soil particles, breakdown of aggregates, and transport of eroded particles via runoff (Wischmeier and Smith, 1965, 1978). The Tibetan Plateau (TP) referred to as the Third Pole is one of the highest plateaus worldwide and has an average altitude of more than 4000 m (Yao et al., 2012). Since the mid-1950s, the TP has experienced significant warming exceeding that of other regions in the same latitude zone (Liu and Chen, 2000). Owing to increasing snowmelt and more frequent heavy precipitation events, which may cause more severe soil erosion, knowledge of the rainfall erosivity on the TP is highly important for soil sustainability and thus water and food security. The accuracy of the rainfall erosivity estimation depends mainly on the spatiotemporal accuracy of the precipitation data, especially on the TP, where the seasonal and regional precipitation patterns exhibit significant variability owing to westerly winds, the Indian monsoon, and land-atmosphere interaction. Compared with in situ observations, gridded precipitation data (e.g., satellite-based, reanalysis and fused datasets) are not subjected to topographical limitations and could supply continuous precipitation data (Beck et al., 2017). Many efforts have been made to study the rainfall erosivity on the TP. Most studies employed empirical methods; however, our study has demonstrated that these empirical methods always resulted in obvious biases over the TP, when compared with the values based on the 1 min precipitation data by using the standard method."

            "challenges": [
                "Despite substantial progress, it is still notable that the relative error of the estimated rainfall erosivity increases rapidly with increasing time interval of the precipitation data. For example, the relative error based on hourly data was more than 80 %, compared with the results based on 1 min data. In addition, the accuracy of the rainfall erosivity map is greatly reduced by inadequate weather station coverage, especially in areas with complex climates and terrains. Therefore, the accuracy of rainfall erosivity estimation strongly depends on both the temporal and spatial resolution of the precipitation data. The accuracy of the estimated rainfall erosivity on the TP is largely reduced by the current empirical estimation models and the scarcity of historical weather stations."

                "We firstly calculated the annual rainfall erosivity by using the standard method of rainfall erosivity based on the 1 min in situ precipitation observations and 0.25° hourly ERA5 precipitation data. Secondly, the performances of the ERA5 were systematically assessed in terms of the detection accuracy of the precipitation for erosive events and the estimation accuracy of ERA5-based annual rainfall erosivity. Finally, the historical annual rainfall erosivity data for the TP were produced after correcting the ERA5-based annual rainfall erosivity."

            "findings": [
                "Our results indicate that the ERA5-based estimates have a marked tendency to underestimate annual rainfall erosivity when compared to the station-based estimates, because of the systematic biases of ERA5 precipitation data including the large underestimation of the maximum contiguous 30 min peak intensity and relatively slight overestimation of event erosive precipitation amounts. The multiplier factor map over the TP, which was generated by the inverse distance-weighted method based on the relative changes between the available station-based annual rainfall erosivity grid values and the corresponding ERA5-based values, was employed to correct the ERA5-based annual rainfall erosivity and then reconstruct the annual rainfall erosivity dataset. The multiyear average correction coefficient over the TP between the station-based annual rainfall erosivity values and the newly released data is 0.67. In addition, the probability density and various quantile values of the new data are generally consistent with the station-based values."

                    "Answer": "The challenges of using ERA5 precipitation data for rainfall erosivity estimation on the Tibetan Plateau stem from systematic biases in the ERA5 data, such as underestimation of maximum contiguous 30-minute peak intensity and slight overestimation of event erosive precipitation amounts. These biases lead to underestimation of annual rainfall erosivity when compared to station-based estimates.",

Addressing these challenges involves utilizing high-resolution data, correcting biases in gridded datasets with station observations, and possibly developing new models that better account for the unique climatic and geographical conditions of the region.",
