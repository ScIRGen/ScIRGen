            "description": "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the largest glacier enrichment area in the middle and low latitudes except the South Arctic and Greenland. The solid water body glaciers and liquid water bodies lakes and rivers together form the Asian Water Tower. The thermal and dynamic effects of the TP and their variability are one of the main driving forces for the TP to affect the Asian monsoon and global atmospheric circulation anomalies. To study the thermal properties of the TP itself and its feedback effect, it is necessary to use the results of climate model experiments to carry out the 100-year historical examination of the TP and its surrounding areas and the future 100-year prediction (temperature, precipitation, radiation, etc.).\nThis dataset consists of grid point temperature, precipitation, radiation and other data of the TP and its surrounding areas. Its horizontal range covers 40 ° E-180 °, 20 ° S-80 ° N, and the time resolution includes annual and seasonal average. The data are based on the results of the BCC-CSM2-MR model test conducted by the National Climate Center of China in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), including historical, SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 experiments. According to the bilinear interpolation method, the data are uniformly interpolated to the resolution level of 1 ° x1 °. The data can provide basic information on regional climate and water cycle changes for the second TP investigation period, provide reference for the field investigation results, and study the possible change mechanism.",
            "instructions": "This dataset provides the monthly and annual mean gridded data among 40°E-180°, 20°S-80°N, ranging from 1850 to 2100. The historical simulation time range is 1850-2014, and the future projection data (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) time range is 2015-2100.\nData has been stored in netCDF format, and the annual average data named as \"VAR_yearmean_BCC-CSM2-MR_EXP_r1i1p1f1_gr1x1_YYYY1-YYYY2.nc \", where VAR represents the variable name, EXP represents the experiment name, and YYYY1 and YYYY2 represent the data start and end years, respectively. For example, evspsbl_yearmean_BCC-CSM2-MR_historical_r1i1p1f1_gr1x1_1850-2014.nc represents the historical simulation of evaporation from 1850 to 2014. The seasonal mean data named as “VAR_SEA_BCC-CSM2-MR_EXP_r1i1p1f1_gr1x1_YYYY1-YYYY2.nc”, where VAR represents the variable name, SEA represents the seasonal mean, EXP represents the experiment name, and YYYY1 and YYYY2 represent the data start and end years, respectively. For example, evspsbl_MAM_BCC-CSM2-MR_ssp126_r1i1p1f1_gr1x1_2015-2100.nc represents the spring average (MAM) evaporation from 2015-2100 under the SSP126 scenario.\nData reading method: All netCDF files in this dataset can be read directly using Matlab, NCL, python and other languages.",

The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble can well simulate the variation characteristics of the TP net water vapor budget. The projection results indicate that by the end of the twenty-first century, the water vapor content, the net water vapor import, and precipitation over the TP will increase. Under a high-emissions scenario and compared with the current period (1991–2014), these three variables will increase by 47.99%, 59.77%, and 18.59% in the long term (2081–2100), respectively. The significant enhancement of meridional water vapor transport over the northern TP may be the main reason for the increase in humidity over the TP."

This can enhance the usability of climate datasets by providing a uniform grid for comparison. However, it may also lead to a loss of finer spatial resolution details, which could impact the accuracy of predictions, especially in a geographically complex region like the Tibetan Plateau.",

The ensemble approach can identify consistent patterns across models, offering insights into potential increases in water vapor content and net water vapor import.
