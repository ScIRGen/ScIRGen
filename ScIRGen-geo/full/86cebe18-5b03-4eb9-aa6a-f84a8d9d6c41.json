These factors necessitate the use of specific data collection methods, such as P-wave receiver functions and h-k-c stacking, to accurately capture the average crustal thickness and velocity ratio distributions. The complexity of the region requires careful station placement and data processing to ensure reliable measurements and insights into the crustal composition.",
