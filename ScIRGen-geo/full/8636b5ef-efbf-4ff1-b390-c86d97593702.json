                    "Answer": "In the field above, radiometric correction uses a moment match method to eliminate non-uniformity, striping noise, and smile effects. Radiometric calibration is applied using pre-flight laboratory-measured calibration coefficients, with units in W/(m^2·sr·um). Geometric rough calibration employs POS data obtained synchronously with the image to reconstruct flight strip images. This method significantly improves the visual quality of the images, though they still require further geometric fine calibration using control points to match with georeferenced data.",
