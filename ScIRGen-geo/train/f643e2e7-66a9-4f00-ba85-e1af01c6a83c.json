            "description": "This data set contains the temperature anomaly series for each quarter and month of the years from January, 1951 to December, 2006 on the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the “China Homogenized Historical Temperature Data Set (1951–2004) Version 1.0” and the daily average temperature data from 2005 to 2006, the monthly average temperature of 123 sites on the Tibetan Plateau and its neighboring areas were gridded using the Climate Anomaly Method (CAM). Further, the average monthly temperature anomaly sequences from 1951 to 2006 were established using the area weighting factor method. To maximize the use of the observation data, the method using the data at a nearby reference station to correct the short series of the climatic standard values of the air temperature data is emphatically discussed.

The study of climate change on the plateau during the instrumental period has always been a focal point. However, our understanding of climate change on the plateau is still relatively limited, primarily due to the scarcity of meteorological observation data in both time and space, which has led to an emphasis on data interpolation. At the end of 2006, the China Meteorological Administration released the first homogenized and corrected dataset in China, the \"China Homogenized Historical Temperature Dataset (1951-2004) Version 1.0,\" which provides reliable foundational data support for climate change research."

To compare with the average temperature change series of the plateau, we used the CRUTEM3 dataset provided by the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, which established a monthly average temperature anomaly series for the land areas of the Northern Hemisphere from 1951 to 2006 based on a 5°×5° gridded dataset. Assuming that the climatic differences between two regions that are geographically close and have similar climatic characteristics are stable and depend solely on spatial differences, we corrected the monthly average temperature climate standard values (1961-1990) for 18 short series stations on the plateau based on this assumption."

The trend of the plateau's temperature anomaly series is very similar to that of the average temperature anomaly series of the Northern Hemisphere land area during the same period, but the noise ratio and intensity in the plateau series are much greater."
