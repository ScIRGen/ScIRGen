            "description": "This data set mainly includes the results of Cu and Zn isotopic analysis of mid ocean ridge basalts obtained from iodp1256 borehole in the Pacific Ocean. The sample types include volcanic rocks, sheet dikes, transition zones and gabbros. The Cu and Zn isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation of whole rock samples. The whole rock sample is crushed to less than 200 mesh without pollution, and the powder is digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin. Then, the copper and zinc isotopes are tested by MC-ICPMS. The international standard samples are selected to monitor the test data, and the data quality reaches the international first class.",
