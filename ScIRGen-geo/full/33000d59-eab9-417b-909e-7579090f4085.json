            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with MODIS was obtained in C1, G1 and B2 of the Biandukou foci experimental area on Mar. 12, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) the surface temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer in C1, G1 and B2 from 11:30 to 12:15. The underlying surface was the deep plowed land, the rape stubble and the grassland.\n     (2) the gravimetric soil moisture (soil samples from 0-1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm, 5-10cm and 10-20cm) by the microwave drying method.\n     (3) the frost depth by the chopstick and the ruler. The soil was considered frozen when it was hard and with ice crystal. The land cover type photos were archived.\n     Four data files were archived, MODIS data, C1 (the land cover type, the surface temperature and the vegetation parameters), G1 ( the surface temperature, the frost depth and the soil moisture) and B2 (the surface temperature, the frost depth and the soil moisture) data.",

In contrast, assessing soil moisture content entails collecting soil samples from various depths, drying them in a microwave oven, and calculating the soil's weight moisture content. The temperature measurement is immediate and non-invasive, whereas the soil moisture method requires sample collection, drying, and calculation, thus being more time-consuming and invasive.",

Additionally, the use of handheld infrared thermometers with a short measurement period could lead to variability in data collection due to changes in environmental conditions or instrument calibration. The measurement method, particularly the near-distance measurement mode, can also introduce variability based on the operator's consistency and environmental interference.",

This method allows for detailed analysis of temperature variations across different surface types like deep ploughed land, rapeseed stubble land, and grassland. It provides essential data for understanding surface temperature dynamics, which can be used for calibrating and validating remote sensing data like MODIS.",

This data collection aims to measure surface radiation temperature, physical temperature, ground cover type, and soil moisture, which are critical for understanding land surface processes and improving satellite data calibration. The choice of data collection methods, including the use of handheld infrared thermometers and microwave drying for soil moisture assessment, is influenced by the need for precise and localized measurements that can accurately represent the conditions of specific surface types like deep-plowed fields, rape stubble fields, and grasslands during the observation period.",

The procedure involves measuring the surface radiation temperature at specific time intervals, with consideration for the underlying surface types, which include deep-plowed land, rapeseed stubble land, and grassland. These variations in surface types can affect the measurement process, as different surfaces may emit and absorb radiation differently, potentially influencing the accuracy and consistency of the temperature readings.",
