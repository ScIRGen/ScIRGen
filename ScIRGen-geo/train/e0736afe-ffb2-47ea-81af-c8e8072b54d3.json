            "description": "Based on the data information of 21 regular meteorological observation stations in Heihe River Basin and its surrounding areas and 13 national benchmark stations around Heihe River provided by the data management center of Heihe plan, the daily air temperature is statistically sorted out, and the monthly air temperature data of 1961-2010 for many years is calculated, and the spatial stability analysis is carried out to calculate the coefficient of variation. If the coefficient of variation is greater than 100%, then Calculate the relationship between the station and geographical terrain factors by geographical weighted regression, and get the monthly temperature distribution trend; if the coefficient of variation is less than or equal to 100%, calculate the relationship between the station temperature value and geographical terrain factors (longitude, latitude, elevation) by ordinary least square regression, and get the monthly temperature distribution trend; use HASM (high accuracy surface modeling) for the residual after removing the trend Method). Finally, the monthly average temperature distribution of the Heihe River Basin in 1961-2010 is obtained by adding the trend surface results and the residual correction results. Time resolution: average monthly temperature for many years from 1961 to 2010. Spatial resolution: 500M.",

                    "Answer": "The inference about the spatial distribution of average temperatures in the Heihe River Basin between 1961 and 2010 is that these methods were used to understand the relationship between station temperature values and geographic topographical factors such as latitude, longitude, and elevation. The geographic weighted regression was applied when the variability coefficient exceeded 100%, suggesting a need to account for spatial non-stationarity, while ordinary least squares regression was used when the coefficient was less than or equal to 100%, indicating a more uniform spatial relationship. These approaches help elucidate the temperature distribution trends over time and space.",
