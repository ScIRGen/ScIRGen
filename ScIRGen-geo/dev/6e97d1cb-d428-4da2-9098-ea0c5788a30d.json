            "description": "The 4th China Urban Rural Elderly Population Survey was conducted in August 2015, which was a nationwide cross-sectional survey that included 224142 elderly people aged 60 and above in China. We assessed the incidence of diabetes and related conditions through descriptive analysis and chi square analysis of demographic data, living habits, socio-economic factors and complications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to describe the odds ratio (OR) of the incidence of diabetes in different groups. Stratified analysis based on gender, age, and urban-rural region. All data is collected by trained researchers according to standardized protocols. Each questionnaire has a unique number, start and end time, and the investigator's signature on the cover. Due to the large amount of information collected, we removed unnecessary information such as commuting methods and children's work for our research purposes, while retaining information such as demographic characteristics, health status, social participation, family life, psychology, etc.",

                "A growing aging population in China is one of the key challenges facing public healthcare in the country. In fact, China has already become an aging society. In 2019, there were 164.5 million citizens aged 65 or older, including 26 million aged 80 years or more. It is predicted that the total population will reach 1.40–1.44 billion by 2030 and 1.29–1.40 billion by 2050 according to a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CDC). The proportion of elderly individuals aged 65 years or more was continuously increasing, from 6.96% in 2000 to 8.87% in 2010, and 13.50% in 2020; this age group will comprise 20% of the total population by 2033 and 30% by 2050 from the Fifth Population Census to the Seventh Population Census. Meanwhile, age-related diseases such as diabetes and complications will impose a significant burden on family and public healthcare systems. In 2019, it was estimated that 19.3% of people aged 65–99 years (135.6 million, 95% confidence interval (CI): 107.6–170.6 million) live with diabetes globally. Over the next two decades, the number of people with diabetes will grow from 195.2 million to 276.2 million worldwide. In 2015, diabetes cost US$ 1.31 trillion (95% CI 1.28–1.36), or 1.8% (95% CI 1.8–1.9) of the global economy. China has experienced a dramatic increase in diabetes prevalence, from 2.5% in 1994 to 9.7% in 2008, and to 11.6% in 2010. As of 2019, there are 116.4 million adults in China with diabetes, representing approximately 12.8% of its adult population."

And potential risk factor analysis is correlation analysis, not causality analysis. Secondly, we do not test blood sugar to distinguish the hidden diabetes and pre-diabetes, nor do we gather information of the control and treatment of diabetes among the elderly. There are biases from the older persons due to recall bias or cognitive impairment. Thirdly, some variables were not evaluated. The dimensions and number of variables were large, and there was a lack of assessment on presence and change of these modifiable lifestyles, before or after the diagnosis of diabetes."

All data were collected by trained study personnel in accordance with standardized protocols. From a total of 224,142 cases, we excluded those with missing data, including 9,084 cases whose diabetes status was not clear and 17 individuals who had more than 10 missing independent variables. The statistical significance of differences was assessed using Chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a post hoc two-tailed Newman–Keuls test when two or more groups were compared. In univariate logistic regression analysis, demographic data (household registration, age, gender and education level), living habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep quality and exercise), socioeconomic factors (medical insurance, gainful employment, poverty, economic status, public benefit activities, spiritual cultural life), and comorbidities (malignant tumor, cataract/glaucoma, hypertension, CCVD, COPD) were analyzed as independent variables. After that, statistically significant independent variables in the univariate logistic regression analysis were included in the multivariate regression analysis. Stratification analysis was also performed, based on gender, age, and residing in urban or rural areas."

Interestingly, the never-married group had significantly lower rates of diabetes than the married group. People with hypertension were significantly more likely to develop diabetes than those with normal blood pressure. The prevalence of diabetes in tumor patients and cataract/glaucoma patients was also higher than that in patients without these comorbidities."
