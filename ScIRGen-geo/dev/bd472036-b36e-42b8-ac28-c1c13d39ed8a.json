            "description": "Based on the MODIS satellite remote sensing data, the overall vegetation coverage (VC) of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor was calculated. The traditional VC formula selects the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a variable. For the reduction of deviation caused by soil background and the impacts of the atmosphere, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) instead of NDVI is adopted in the calculation process of VC data set. The original data is the enhanced vegetation index data in the Terra MODIS Vegetation Index Data Version 6 (MOD13A3) with the resolution of 1 km. The MOD13A3 dataset is of higher quality than the source data because it filters the outliers or missing measurements of the MODIS satellite data. The China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor is an area with high risk of desertification. At present, the development of desertification in the corridor extends along the main road between China and Mongolia, and the desertification is the most serious in densely populated urban areas. The regional desertification information can be extracted effectively from the vegetation coverage data, which will provide ecological and environmental data support for the disaster risk prevention and safe operation of transportation and pipelines.",

The dataset is refined to filter out anomalies or missing values present in the original MODIS satellite data.",
