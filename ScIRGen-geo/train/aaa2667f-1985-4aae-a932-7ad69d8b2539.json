            "description": "Over the past two to three decades, Chinese forests are estimated to act as a significant carbon sink, yet the magnitude and spatial patterns of this sink differ considerably among studies. Using three microwave (L- and X-band vegetation optical depth (VOD)) and three optical (normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, and tree cover) remote sensing vegetation products, this study compared the estimated live woody aboveground biomass carbon (AGC) dynamics over China between 2013 and 2019. Our results showed that tree cover has the highest spatial consistency with three published AGC maps (mean correlation value R = 0.84), followed by L-VOD (R = 0.83), which outperform the other VODs. An AGC estimation model was proposed to combine all indices to estimate the annual AGC dynamics in China during 2013-2019. The performance of the AGC estimation model was good (RMSE = 0.05 Pg C and R2 = 0.90 with a mean relative uncertainty of 9.8% at pixel-scale (0.25°)). Results of the AGC estimation model showed that carbon uptake by the forests in China was about +0.17 Pg C yr-1 from 2013 to 2019. At regional level, provinces in southwest China including Guizhou (+22.35 Tg C yr-1), Sichuan (+14.49 Tg C yr-1), and Hunan (+11.42 Tg C yr-1) provinces had the highest carbon sink rates during 2013-2019. Most of the carbon-sink regions have been afforested recently, implying that afforestation and ecological engineering projects have been effective means for carbon sequestration in these regions.",

                    "Answer": "The uncertainty in assessing the carbon sequestration potential and spatial distribution changes of China's forest ecosystems is influenced by the varying monitoring capabilities of different optical vegetation index products and microwave vegetation optical depth products.

                    "Answer": "To utilize low-frequency passive microwave vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) products for estimating aboveground forest carbon storage over a large scale, the following methodological steps can be considered: Firstly, evaluate the monitoring capabilities of various optical vegetation index products and microwave vegetation optical depth products within the region to identify the advantages of microwave products, particularly the L-band, in monitoring carbon storage over large scales. Next, integrate these vegetation indices and L-VOD products within a random forest model framework to predict the annual variations in aboveground forest carbon storage. This process involves using the strengths of both optical and microwave data to improve estimation accuracy. Finally, estimate the dynamic changes in forest carbon storage over a specified period, such as from 2013 to 2019, and analyze the trends in key areas to assess regional contributions to carbon sequestration.",
