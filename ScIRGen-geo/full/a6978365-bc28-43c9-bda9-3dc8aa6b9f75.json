The Dasuopu Ice Core dust dataset for the past 1000 years records dust records, oxygen isotopes, chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates from the Tibetan Plateau. The Dasuopu Ice Core black carbon dataset for the past 210 years records black carbon data from the Dasuopu Glacier from 1781 to 1992. The Tibetan Plateau metal element dataset for the past 1000 years records Al, Si, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb Sr and other metal element data. The trace element data from the Puruogangri Ice Cap over the past 500 years records trace element data of Ag, Al, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Nb, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V, and Zn in the Purogangri Ice Cap over the Tibetan Plateau from 1497 to 1991.",

                "The Holocene climate of the southern Tibetan Plateau has been dominated by the South Asian Monsoon in the summer and by westerly cyclonic activity in the winter. The strength of the monsoon is determined by a number of forcing mechanisms operating over a variety of time scales. Northern Hemisphere (NH) insolation has been relatively high over the past 10,000 years with correspondingly greater monsoonal activity than during the last glacial stage, when NH insolation was lower. At that time, reduced differential heating between the Indian Ocean and the Asian continent weakened the summer circulation, producing cooler, drier conditions over Asia and across the southern plateau. On shorter time scales, variations in the strength of the South Asian Monsoon have been explained by changes in internal boundary conditions, such as increasing tropical sea surface temperatures, variations in Eurasian snow cover, and linkages with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The Himalayas contain the largest volume of ice outside the polar regions, and the meltwater from its glaciers form the headwaters of such important rivers as the Indus and the Ganges."

C2 was brought (in a frozen state) to the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology (LIGG), C3 was brought (also frozen) to the Byrd Polar Research Center, and C1 was split between the two institutes.
