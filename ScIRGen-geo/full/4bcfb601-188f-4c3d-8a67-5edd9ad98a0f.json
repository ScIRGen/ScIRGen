            "description": "Hydrochemistry and persistent organic pollutants in soils were analyzed in Issyk-Kul region from the western Tian Shan Mountains. \nAs organchlorine pesticides (OCPs) may be an ecologic threat to mountain environments due to their tendency to deposit and accumulate in mountain regions undergoing long-range air transport, OCPs were analyzed in soils collected from an intermontane basin of the western Tian Shan Mountains, which is the UNESCO protected natural reserve of Issyk-Kul. Total OCP concentrations in the Issyk-Kul region ranged from 4.63 to 414 ng/g dw, of which two extraordinary high OCP concentrations (414 ng/g dw and 213 ng/g dw, respectively) influenced by an abandoned dumping site and urban sewage, respectively, were found. Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis inferred that the OCP inputs in the east of the Issyk-Kul region were mainly from local endogenous sources, and exogenous input via LRAT processes were prominent in the west and south. Additionally, the isomeric and parent substance/metabolite ratios revealed most pesticides accumulated in this region were from old usage, while DDTs had fresh input because of possibly illegal regional application and a slow degradation from the dumping site. Furthermore, ecological risk assessment revealed that no frequently adverse ecological effects were observed in the Issyk-Kul region, but potential risks on neighbouring organisms induced by p,p’-DDT and γ-HCH in dumping site and urban sewage should be considered when devising an efficient management plan to prevent secondary pollution.",

                    "Answer": "The observed patterns suggest that the pollution is mainly from historical residues, with local sources such as illegal usage and slow decomposition at waste treatment points contributing to the presence of certain pollutants like DDT. The spatial distribution indicates that local sources are more significant in the Issyk-Kul area, while atmospheric long-distance transport affects the western and southern parts.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing both field surveys and atmospheric long-distance transmission data can enhance the accuracy of pollution source identification by providing a comprehensive view of both local and transported pollutant sources. In the case of the Issyk-Kul region, this approach helps distinguish between historical local sources and those pollutants transported over long distances, leading to more precise identification and assessment of the pollution sources.",
