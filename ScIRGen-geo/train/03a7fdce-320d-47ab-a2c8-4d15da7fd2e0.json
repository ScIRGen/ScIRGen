            "description": "This data belongs to zircon U-Pb geochronology data of Jurassic strata in Yanshan tectonic belt, including Pb, 232Th, 238U contents, 207Pb / 206Pb, 2upb geochronology data of early Mesozoic strata in Yanshan technological belt (230-225ma). Docx07pb / 235U, 206Pb / 238U ratio and error, 207Pb / 235U, 206Pb / 238U age and error data, etc. Zircon U-Pb dating was performed in the ion probe Laboratory of Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences using cameca ims-1280hr. The U-Th-Pb isotopic ratios were determined by standard zircon pl é Sovice correction was achieved. The U content was obtained by standard zircon 91500 correction. Simultaneous interpreting of the standard deviation and the internal accuracy of the single point test was achieved by the standard sample of long term monitoring, and the single point error was obtained. The accuracy of the standard sample Qinghu was used as the unknown sample monitoring data. The measured 204Pb value is used for ordinary Pb correction. The error of isotope ratio and age is 1 σ。 The harmonious age and average age were calculated by using the isoplot software. The results of geochronology are published in Tectonophysics, and the data quality is reliable. It plays a key role in determining the Middle Jurassic stratigraphic age and tectonic deformation age of Yanshan structural belt, and has a good application prospect.",

In this context, it involves the use of a Cameca IMS-1280HR at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, to analyze zircon for U-Pb dating. The data includes measurements such as Pb, 232Th, 238U content, 207Pb/206Pb, 206Pb/238U ratios, and their corresponding errors, which are essential for understanding the timing of geological events in the Yanshan tectonic belt.",

                    "Answer": "The use of standard zircons such as Plésovice and 91500 is necessary for calibration purposes to ensure accuracy and precision in measuring U-Th-Pb isotopic ratios and U content. These standards provide a reference point for correcting the isotopic ratios and U content obtained from the samples. The calibration helps in accounting for instrumental biases and variability, thereby enhancing the reliability of the obtained geochronology data. This is crucial for determining the ages and tectonic deformation periods of the Jurassic strata in the Yanshan tectonic belt.",

The U-Th-Pb isotopic ratios are calibrated using standard zircon Plésovice, and U content is calibrated using standard zircon 91500. The standard deviation and internal precision from long-term monitoring of standard samples are used to propagate single-point errors, with Qinghu standard as a monitoring benchmark for accuracy.
