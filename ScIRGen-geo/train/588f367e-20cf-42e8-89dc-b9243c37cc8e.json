            "description": "Gridded population with 100m spaital resolution of the 34 key areas along One Belt One Road in 2010, which indicates that the population count (Unit: person) per pixel (i.e., grid). This data is derived from geodata institute of Southampton University, UK. The prejection transform and extraction processes were done to generate the gridded population with 100m spaital resolution of the 8 key areas along One Belt One Road in 2010. The original gridded popution is spatially downscaled from census data and multisource data by the random forest method. Accurate population data at finer scale are fundamental for a broad range of applications by governments, nongovernmental organizations, and companies, including the urban planing, election, risk estimation, disaster rescue, disease control, and poverty reduction.",
