            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Zhangye-Yingke-Huazhaizi flight zone on Jul. 11, 2008.\n     Intra-band data available for general users include Level-2C data (after geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections), Level-1B browse image (after intra-band matching) and Level-2B browse image (after registration). The raw data, Level-1A, and data processing parameters were filed; applications would be evaluated prior to access. Data processing started in Aug. 2008 and ended in Apr. 2009, and in Nov. 2009, CCD data were reprocessed to adjust radiometric calibration. \n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id\n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 3#6 || 3196.6m || 13:23:54 || 13:31:18 || 112 || processed;complete || good || Huazhaizi desert plot 1\n|-\n| 2 || 3#10_1 || 3167.6m || 13:36:06 || 13:44:34  || 128 || processed;complete || good || Zhangye city, the wetland park, Yingke weather station maize field, Yingke wheat field, and Huazhaizi desert maize plot\n|-\n| 3 || 3#10_2 || 1607.2m || 13:52:14 || 13:59:34  || 111 || processed;complete || good || Zhangye city, the wetland park, Yingke weather station maize field, Yingke wheat field, and Huazhaizi desert maize plot\n|-\n| 4 || 3#10_3 || 823.3m || 14:13:46 || 14:14:34  || 133 || processed;complete || good || Zhangye city, the wetland park, Yingke weather station maize field, Yingke wheat field, and Huazhaizi desert maize plot\n|}",

Geometric correction is necessary to align the data spatially with the real-world coordinates, addressing issues like sensor orientation and platform motion. Radiometric calibration ensures that the sensor's output reflects the true spectral characteristics of the observed surfaces, accounting for sensor-specific and environmental factors. Atmospheric correction is crucial to remove distortions caused by atmospheric interference, such as scattering and absorption, which can affect the sensor readings and lead to inaccuracies in data interpretation.",
