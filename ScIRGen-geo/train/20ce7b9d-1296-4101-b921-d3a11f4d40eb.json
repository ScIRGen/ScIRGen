One belt, one road, was used to assess the rainfall in the important area along the GPM IMERG Final Run (GPM) daily rainfall. The extreme precipitation threshold of 34 important nodes was evaluated by percentile method. The daily precipitation period was identified by the calculated threshold, and the surface inundation area was produced on the basis of extreme precipitation.\nThe data range mainly includes 34 key nodes of Pan third pole (Vientiane, Alexandria, Yangon, Calcutta, Warsaw, Karachi, yekajerinburg, Chittagong, Djibouti, etc.)\nThe data set can provide the basis for local government decision-making, so as to correctly identify extreme precipitation and reduce the loss of life and property caused by extreme precipitation.",

                "Precipitation is a crucial component of the global water cycle and a fundamental part of the climate system. Obtaining accurate spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation plays a vital role in water resource management, agricultural production, weather forecasting, and flood and drought disaster monitoring. Traditional methods for obtaining precipitation data are based on ground rain gauge observations, which have high precision at point scales but are sparse in distribution in remote or complex terrain areas due to logistical challenges. With the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology over the past decade, many high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing precipitation products have emerged, providing new data support for global and regional precipitation research. Among them, the TRMM satellite, jointly developed and launched by NASA and JAXA in 1997, has been widely used in climate and hydrological research in tropical regions. Building on the successful operation of the TRMM satellite, NASA and JAXA launched the latest GPM satellite on February 28, 2014, which, in addition to inheriting the TRMM's ability to detect medium and large-scale precipitation, also carries the latest dual-frequency radar system and improved microwave radiometer performance, enhancing the detection capability for light and solid precipitation. However, due to the short operational time of the satellite, existing accuracy validation studies of GPM precipitation data in Mainland China have been limited to short-term evaluations, with time series not exceeding a year, and lacking monthly scale analysis. Moreover, current validation efforts often use station density, climate, and topographic characteristics for regional division, without conducting accuracy evaluations on a basin scale, which is a crucial unit in hydrological research."
