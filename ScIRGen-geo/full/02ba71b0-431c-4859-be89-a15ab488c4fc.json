            "description": "The UHSLC offers tide gauge data with two levels of quality-control (QC). Fast Delivery (FD) data are released within 1-2 months of data collection and receive only basic QC focused on large level shifts and obvious outliers. The GLOSS/CLIVAR (formerly known as the WOCE) \"fast\" sea level data is distributed as hourly, daily, and monthly values. This project is supported by the NOAA Climate and Global Change program, and is one of the activities of the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center. Each file is given a name \"h###.dat\" where \"h\" denotes hourly sea level data and \"###\" denotes the station number.  A file exists for every station with hourly data. The UHSLC datasets are GLOSS data streams (read more here). There are many tide gauge records in the UHSLC database, but the backbone is the GLOSS Core Network (GCN) – a global set of ~300 tide gauge stations that serve as the foundation of the global in situ sea level network. The network is designed to provide evenly distributed sampling of global coastal sea level variation at a variety of time-scales.",

                    "Answer": "The dual-level quality control approach applied to tidal measurement data indicates that there is a systematic effort to ensure data reliability by addressing both major shifts and obvious anomalies. The existence of two levels of quality control—basic QC for rapid delivery data and more detailed QC for historical data—suggests an awareness of potential biases and errors that can occur in the data collection process. This method underscores the importance of distinguishing between quick, preliminary data for immediate use and more thoroughly vetted data for long-term analysis, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and usability of the dataset over the extensive time period from 1913 to 2017.",

                    "Answer": "Using a global network of tidal stations, such as the UHSLC dataset which includes the core network of 300 stations, ensures a uniform distribution of sea level change measurements across various time scales. This helps in providing a consistent and comprehensive view of global coastal sea level changes. However, challenges may arise in maintaining data accuracy and reliability due to varying levels of quality control across stations, potential data gaps, and differences in data collection methodologies over the years.",

This aims to support the understanding and monitoring of global sea level changes, which is crucial for climate research and coastal management. The dataset also serves as a backbone for the GLOSS data stream, ensuring that the data is reliable and accessible for further scientific analysis and policy-making.",

The first is a quick delivery (FD) data quality control, which focuses on major level shifts and obvious anomalies, and is released within 1-2 months of data collection. This basic QC ensures that the data is suitable for immediate use. The second level, GLOSS/CLIVAR 'fast' sea level data, involves more detailed checks and is distributed as hourly, daily, and monthly values. This ensures that the data is reliable for both immediate use and long-term studies.",
