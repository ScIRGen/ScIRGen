            "description": "The research project on land surface data assimilation system in western China belongs to the major research plan of \"environmental and ecological science in western China\" of the national natural science foundation. the person in charge is researcher Li Xin of the institute of environment and engineering in cold and arid regions of the Chinese academy of sciences. the project runs from January 2003 to December 2005.\nThe output data set of the Land Surface Assimilation System in Western China is one of the data achievements of the project. It is a Chinese Land Surface Data Assimilation System constructed by Dr. Huang Chun Lin and researcher Li Xin of the Institute of Cold and Arid Region Environment and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. CoLM model is used as a model operator to couple microwave radiation transmission models for different surface states such as soil (including melting and freezing), snow cover, etc. and to assimilate passive microwave observations (SSM/I and AMSR-E), so that the system can finally output assimilation data of soil moisture, soil temperature, snow cover, frozen soil, sensible heat, latent heat, evaporation, etc. with higher accuracy.\nData format and naming:\nIt is stored in a monthly folder and contains 24 hours of data every day.  The naming rules are as follows: YYYMMDDHH.grid, where YY is the year (2002), MM is the month, DD is the day, HH is the hour,. grid and. flux are file extensions, the former is the state variable output result and the latter is the flux output result.  The file format is a binary FLOAT value, that is, every 4 bytes represents a value.",
