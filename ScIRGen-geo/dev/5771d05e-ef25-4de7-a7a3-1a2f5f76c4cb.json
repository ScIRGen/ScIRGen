            "description": "This data set includes whole-rock major trace and isotopic geochemical data, monazite, and zircon radioisotope dating data. The samples were collected from the Laguigangri dome of the Himalayan orogenic belt in southern Tibet. The geochemical data of major elements in the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, the trace elements are obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, and the radioisotope dating of monazite and zircon is obtained by laser denudation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The data quality is high. These data show that the leucogranitic magma in the Himalayan orogenic belt was formed in multiple stages and came from different homologous areas, which provides a key limit for the magmatic formation mechanism.",
