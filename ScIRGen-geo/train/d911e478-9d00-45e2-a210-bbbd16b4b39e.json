            "description": "Proba (project for on board autonomy) is the smallest earth observation satellite launched by ESA in 2001. Chris (compact high resolution imaging Spectrometer) is the most important imaging spectrophotometer on the platform of proba. It has five imaging modes. With its excellent spectral spatial resolution and multi angle advantages, it can image land, ocean and inland water respectively for different research purposes. It is the only on-board sensor in the world that can obtain hyperspectral and multi angle data at the same time. It has high spatial resolution, wide spectral range, and can collect rich information in biophysics, biochemistry, etc. At present, there are 23 scenes of proba Chris data in Heihe River Basin. \nThe coverage and acquisition time are as follows: 4 scenes in Arjun dense observation area, 2008-11-18, 2008-12-05, 2009-03-29, 2009-05-22; 1 scene in pingdukou dense observation area, 2009-07-13; 7 scenes in Binggou basin dense observation area, 2008-11-19, 2008-11-26, 2008-12-06, 2009-01-10, 2009-03-04, 2009-03-30, 2009-03-31; dayokou basin dense observation area, 2009-07-13 There are two views in the observation area, 2008-10-23, 2009-06-08; one in Linze area, 2008-06-23; one in Minle area, 2008-10-22; seven in Yingke oasis dense observation area, 2008-04-30, 2008-05-09, 2008-06-04, 2008-07-01, 2008-07-19, 2009-05-31, 2009-08-10. \nThe product level is L1 without geometric correction. Except that there are only four angles for the images of 2009-03-29 and 2009-05-24 in the Arjun encrypted observation area, each image has five different angles. \nThe remote sensing data set of the comprehensive remote sensing joint experiment of Heihe River, proba Chris, was obtained through the \"dragon plan\" project (Project No.: 5322) (see the data use statement for details).",

Accurate LAI retrieval is always a key task of such remote-sensing applications, and it is also a precondition of crop-yield estimation, vegetative evapotranspiration calculation and the energy-exchange evaluation of terrestrial vegetation (Badhwar et al., 1986; Townshend et al., 1988; Baret et al., 1991; Wood et al., 1993; Bonan, 1995; Bicheron et al., 1999; Buermann et al., 2001; Kamalesh et al., 2008). In general, there are three categories of LAI retrieval methods. The first category is experiential inversion method based on Vegetation Index (VI), such as retrieving LAI according to the correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LAI (Turner, 1999; Brown et al., 2000; Haboudane et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005). Although such an approach is simple and widely-used, its accuracy is very low, and some VI can easily get saturated. The second category can be called the reflectance model inversion method, by which the anisotropic effect caused by sun-object-sensor geometry can be removed, but the effect caused by background variations cannot be avoided, especially within mixed pixels. The complex background inhibits accurate LAI retrieval (Li et al., 1986; Nilson et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1997; Xu, 2005)."
