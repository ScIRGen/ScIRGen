            "description": "The dataset of the ground-based microwave radiometers and ground truth observations (multi-frequency, multi-polar multi-angle) for soil freeze/thaw cycle in the A'rou foci experimental area from Oct. 19 to 25, 2007, during the pre-observation period, X-band from Oct. 20 to 25, S-band from Oct. 20 to 25, K-band from Oct. 19 to 24, and Ka-band from Oct. 20 to 24, to be specific. The aims of the measurements were the effects of the soil freeze/thaw status on  the microwave brightness temperatures. Those provide reliable ground data for improving and verifying microwave radiative transfer models and parameters retrieval of soil freeze/thaw status.\n     Time-continuous ground observations synchronizing with the ground-based microwave radiometers including self-recording and manual measurements, were carried out in No. 1 quadrate of A'rou with dry natural grassland as the landscape.\n     (1) self-recording observations: the soil temperatures at 0cm, 5cm, 10cm, 15cm and 20cm by the temperature probe from Oct. 21 to 25, 2007, and shallow layer soil moisture at 0-5cm, 5cm, 10cm, 15cm and 20cm by TDR from Oct. 19 to 21 2007. Both time interval of the observations were 5 minutes.\n     (2) manual observations: the surface radiative temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer, the soil temperature at 0cm, 5cm, 10cm, 15cm and 20cm by the glass geothermometer, and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer. The time interval of observations was 30 minutes from Oct. 19-21, 2007.",

Specific procedures include conducting observations at different frequency bands (X, S, K, Ka) over specified periods, with the main objective of assessing the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on microwave brightness temperature. These observations occur in a natural grassland area with dry conditions. Additionally, real-time and manual observations complement the data, where temperature probes are used to obtain soil temperature at various depths, while TDR probes measure shallow soil moisture. Data collection involves precise time-stepping, with automatic logging every 5 minutes for soil temperature and moisture, and manual measurements at 30-minute intervals for surface radiation temperature and soil temperature at specified depths.",
