The interpolation algorithm was adpoted from Reuter et al. (2007). \nSRTM's data organization method is as follows: divide a file into 24 rows (-60 to 60 degrees) and 72 columns (-180 to 180 degrees) in every 5 degrees of latitude and longitude grid, and the data resolution is 90 meters.\nData usage: SRTM data are expressed as elevation values with 16-bit values (-/+/32767 m), maximum positive elevation of 9000m, and negative elevation (12000m below sea level). For null data use the -32767 standard.",

                    "Answer": "SRTM DEM data refers to Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model data, which is a dataset representing the Earth's topography. It is typically used in topographical studies to analyze and map the terrain by providing elevation information. The data is organized in 5-degree latitude and longitude grids and is available at a resolution of 90 meters. In topographical studies, it's used for applications such as hydrological modeling, geological studies, and landform analysis.",

                    "Answer": "The use of specific interpolation algorithms for filling data voids in digital elevation models, such as those for the Tibetan Plateau, is driven by the need to enhance accuracy and completeness of the terrain data. The region's complex topography and the limitations of original SRTM 90 data in capturing fine details necessitate advanced methods to address gaps and ensure a reliable representation of the landscape. The interpolation method referenced, developed by Reuter et al. (2007), provides improved techniques for dealing with such challenges, ensuring more precise elevation data.",

                    "Answer": "The use of the interpolation method from Reuter et al. (2007) aims to better fill the data voids present in the SRTM 90 dataset. As a consequence, this approach could enhance the accuracy and completeness of the dataset by providing more reliable elevation data where gaps previously existed. This improvement in data quality can lead to more precise topographical analyses and applications that depend on accurate DEM data.",

(2007), which are designed to effectively fill gaps in the SRTM 90 data. This method helps improve the quality of elevation data by enhancing the continuity and accuracy of the terrain representation, ensuring that the resulting dataset maintains a consistent resolution of 90 meters across the covered geographical area.",
