            "description": "Taking China and the five Central Asian countries as the research area, an optimization model of multilateral agricultural trade between China and the five Central Asian countries based on the constraints of water and soil resources is constructed. The optimization goal is to maximize the total trade income, and at the same time, a series of constraints such as the equalization of water and soil resources, import and export trade volume, and water and soil resources income of each country are considered to achieve the coordinated guarantee of the maximization of overall trade income and the equalization of water and soil resources income. On this basis, the dynamic changes of the virtual nitrogen and phosphorus flow and nitrogen and phosphorus balance between China and Central Asia under trade volume, trade structure and different trade optimization scenarios are analyzed. The data set provides the changes in nitrogen and phosphorus surplus and utilization efficiency of the five Central Asian countries and China is driven by agricultural trade from 1992 to 2018, and the intensity of nitrogen and phosphorus surplus in 2020-2034 under two trade optimization models. The data set can provide basic data support for the future development and utilization of land resources and agricultural development of the five Central Asian countries.",
