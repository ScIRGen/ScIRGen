            "description": "As an important grain production base in China, the North China Plain is short of water resources while with a high level of agricultural production. The contradiction between water supply and food demand would continue to intensify under climate change. It is urgent to obtain the key data of evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP) and typical crop yield of agroecosystems in the North China Plain. Better understanding of their spatiotemporal variations is of great significance for improvement of agricultural water use efficiency and food security. The water-carbon coupling model was combined with a crop growth simulation method in the Remote Sensing based cropland Ecohydrological Model (ReSEM). Then, this study estimates ET and GPP of agroecosystems and yield of main crop types (winter wheat-summer maize) in the North China Plain from 2001 to 2018 according to crop planting types and phenology distribution. The ReSEM considers different parameterization schemes for wheat (representing C3 crops) and corn (representing C4 crops). The resolution of ET and GPP fluxes is 500 meters and 8 days, and the yield estimates are annual result with 500 meters resolution. This dataset provides a basis for assessing the changes in agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity in the North China Plain.",
            "instructions": "ET and GPP fluxes are stored in TIFF format which are named as “yyyy-mm-dd. Tif”. For example, the file of “2001-01-01.tif” corresponds to the value of each variable on January 1, 2001, representing the average result from January 1 to January 8, 2001. Each file contains 4 bands, corresponding to GPP, crop transpiration (Ec), soil evaporation (Es) and evaporation from rainfall interception (Ei) in turn with the unit of gC m-2 d-1, mm d-1, mm d-1 and mm d-1 respectively. Note that the value of each variable is the product of each pixel value and the scaling factor (0.01). The last image of each year is the average of the last five days (nonleap year) or six days (leap year). The yield data is also saved as TIFF grid data, including the annual yield of winter wheat and summer corn with the unit of kg ha-1.",

With climate change potentially exacerbating the conflict between water resource availability and food production, it is crucial to acquire key data on the temporal and spatial variability of farmland ecosystems' ET and GPP. Such data enhance the efficient use of agricultural water resources and ensure food security. The research employs a remote sensing-based agro-hydrological model (ReSEM) alongside water-carbon coupling and crop growth simulation models, integrating crop type and phenology distribution data, to estimate the ET and GPP trends and typical crop yields.",
