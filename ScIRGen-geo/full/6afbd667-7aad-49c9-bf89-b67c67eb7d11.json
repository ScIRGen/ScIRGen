                    "Answer": "U-Pb isotopic dating is a method of determining the age of zircon crystals in geological samples by measuring the ratios of uranium to lead isotopes. This process is conducted using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to analyze the isotopic composition. The method involves using specific equipment like a GeoLas-HD laser and Agilent 7900 quadrupole ICP-MS, with international standards such as 91500 for external calibration and GJ-1, SA01 for isotope ratio monitoring. The data provide age estimates that are crucial for constructing geological frameworks and understanding tectonic evolution.",

                    "Answer": "The U-Pb isotopic ratios and age discrepancies provide critical insights into the geological history and tectonic evolution by allowing researchers to establish a chronological framework for sediment deposition and magmatic events. These data help infer the timing and nature of tectonic activities, such as basin formation, sedimentation rates, and magmatic intrusions, which are pivotal for understanding the Mesozoic structural evolution of the Hailar Basin.",

                    "Answer": "Accurate U-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS can be challenged by factors such as the precision of the laser ablation process, the calibration standards used, and the correction methods for common lead. In the field above, factors like the choice of international standards (e.g., 91500 for external calibration), the isotopic ratio monitoring with standards like GJ-1 and SA01, and the use of specific software for isotopic ratio calculation and age correction play critical roles. The exclusion criteria for analyses with >10% or <–5% discordance also contribute to ensuring accuracy. These elements are crucial for establishing reliable chronological frameworks for geological formations like those in the Hailar Basin.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to establish a chronological framework for the Mesozoic stratigraphy in the Hailar Basin, which is crucial for understanding the tectonic evolution and basin analysis of this region during the Mesozoic era. The dataset provides reliable age information that supports geological analysis and has significant application prospects in reconstructing the area's tectonic and structural history.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involved in conducting U-Pb zircon dating using LA-ICP-MS include the following: First, zircon samples are prepared and placed in the LA-ICP-MS. The laser ablation process is performed using a GeoLas-HD with a 193nm wavelength at a frequency of 5Hz and a beam size of 30μm. The zircon U-Pb dating is conducted using a quadrupole ICP-MS (Agilent 7900). International standard 91500 is used for external calibration of age calculation, while GJ-1 and SA01 are utilized for monitoring isotope ratios. The U-Pb isotope ratios are calculated with Glitter software, and ComPb Corr#3-18 is used to correct for common Pb ages less than 1000Ma, based on the 206Pb/208U ratio. Analyses with inconsistencies greater than 10% or less than –5% are excluded. The harmonized ages and mean ages are calculated using ISOPLOT software, with average age uncertainty reported at 2σ and individual analysis at 1σ.",
