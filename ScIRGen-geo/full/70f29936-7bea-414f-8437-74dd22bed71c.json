            "description": "This data set mainly includes SR Nd isotopic data of 71 Mesozoic Magmatic Rocks from Murgab block to horog block in South Pamir Plateau. The lithology of rock samples includes mica granite, biotite granite, muscovite granite, felsic dyke and a small amount of diorite inclusions. The data are mainly from articles in the review stage. MC-ICP-MS is sampled by SR Nd isotope test method. The test unit is the engineering research center of the Ministry of education for the exploration of non-ferrous and precious metal concealed deposits of Guilin University of technology. The data results are true and reliable. It can be applied to study the genesis and tectonic evolution of Mesozoic Magmatic Rocks in Pamir Plateau in the future.",

These isotopic ratios are used to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of rocks, particularly igneous rocks. The data provides information on the source material of the rocks and the processes that have affected them over time. The Sr-Nd isotopic data is collected using methods like MC-ICP-MS to ensure accurate and reliable results.",
