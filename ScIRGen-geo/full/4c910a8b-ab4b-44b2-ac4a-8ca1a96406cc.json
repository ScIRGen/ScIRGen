            "description": "POMINO-TROPOMI data is based on POMINO-TROPOMI retrieval algorithm developed by ACM Research Group of Peking University. The algorithm uses the AMFv6 package driven by the parallel LIDORT radiative transfer model, and focuses on improving the calculation of tropospheric NO2 air mass factor (AMF). POMINO-TROPOMI algorithm uses the daily BRDF coefficient of MODIS MCD43C2.006 dataset and OMLER v3 surface albedo data to calculate the surface reflectance. The algorithm uses the aerosol data from nested GEOS Chem (v9-02) simulations to explicitly account for the aerosol optical effects. In addition, the simulated AOD is corrected by the monthly average AOD data of MODIS MYD04_ L2 dataset. Before calculating tropospheric NO2 AMF, POMINO-TROPOMI algorithm uses consistent ancillary parameters and cloud pressure provided by TROOMI PAL v2.3.1 data to re-retrieve cloud fraction. Based on the tropospheric NO2 AMF of POMINO-TROPOMI algorithm and the tropospheric NO2 slant column densities of TROPOMI PAL v2.3.1 data, POMINO-TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCDs are obtained.

Current representative OMI products covering China, DOMINO v2 and OMNO2 v2, do not explicitly account for the effect of aerosols on the solar radiation. Since aerosols affect the radiation field in retrieving both clouds and NO2, the net effect on the retrieved NO2 columns is unclear. This aerosol issue is particularly significant over East China due to its high aerosol loadings. In addition, the DOMINO and OMNO2 products also assume Lambertian surface with no dependence of surface reflectance on the geometry of the light path. DOMINO and OMNO2 adopt the vertical profile of NO2 simulated by coarse-resolution global chemical transport models (CTMs), TM4 at 3° long. × 2° lat. for DOMINO v2 and GMI at 2.5° long. × 2° lat. for OMNO2 v2, which are unable to capture the variability of NO2 at smaller scales."

Our retrieved NO2 columns are 54% of the MAX-DOAS data on average, reflecting the inevitable spatial inconsistency between the two types of measurement, errors in MAX-DOAS data, and uncertainties in our OMI retrieval related to aerosols and vertical profile of NO2."

China has become the top emitter of NOx due to its recent anthropogenic emission growth along with reductions in North America and Europe. Vertical column densities (VCDs) of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) have been used extensively to study Chinese NOx pollution. However, NO2 retrievals from OMI and other space-borne instruments are subject to large systematic and random errors due to uncertainties in the conversion process from radiance to VCDs. In particular, current NO2 algorithms take an implicit approach to accounting for aerosol optical effects, with no explicit specification of aerosols in the retrievals of both NO2 VCDs and ancillary cloud parameters."

Prerequisite cloud optical properties are derived from a dedicated cloud retrieval process that is fully consistent with the main NO2 retrieval. Aerosol optical properties are taken from GEOS-Chem simulations constrained by MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. For the present analysis, POMINO level-2 data for 2012 are aggregated into monthly means on a 0.25° long. ×0.25° lat. grid. We calculated the AMFs for O2–O2 (to derive CF and CP; at 475 nm) and NO2 (at 438 nm) by using a newly improved AMFv6 package to coordinate the retrieval process.

Using POMINO to infer Chinese emissions of nitrogen oxides leads to annual anthropogenic emissions of 9.05 TgN yr−1, an increase from 2006 by about 19%. Replacing the MODIS BRDF data with the OMLER v1 monthly climatological albedo data affects NO2 VCDs by up to 40% for certain locations and seasons. Excluding aerosol information from the retrieval process enhances annual mean NO2 VCDs by 15–40% over much of eastern China. The implicit aerosol treatment also tends to exclude days with high pollution, since aerosols are interpreted as effective clouds and the respective OMI pixels are often excluded by cloud screening; this is a potentially important sampling bias. Therefore, an explicit treatment of aerosols is important for space-based NO2 retrievals and emission constraints."

                    "Answer": "Challenges associated with using coarse-resolution global chemical transport models in NO2 retrievals include the inability to capture the variability of NO2 at smaller scales. Models such as TM4 and GMI used in previous products like DOMINO v2 and OMNO2 v2 are too coarse (3° long. × 2° lat. for TM4 and 2.5° long. × 2° lat. for GMI) to accurately represent NO2 variations, especially in regions with high aerosol loadings like East China. This affects the precision of the NO2 vertical column density retrievals.",

These methods better capture day-to-day variability in NO2 data due to specific radiative transfer calculations and consideration of surface reflectance anisotropy.",
