            "description": "This dataset contains the glacier outlines in Qilian Mountain Area in 2015. The dataset was produced based on classical band ratio criterion and manual editing. Chinese GF series images collected in 2018 were used as basic data for glacier extraction. Sentinel-2 images, Google images and Map World images were employed as reference data for manual adjusting. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates, glacier ID and glacier area. Consisting of 1 season, the dataset has a spatial resolution of 2 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±2 meter). The dataset directly reflects the glacier distribution within the Qilian Mountain in 2018, and can be used for quantitative estimation of glacier mass balance and the quantitative assessment of glacier change’s impact on basin runoff.",

This approach involves analyzing satellite imagery to determine the spectral signature of glaciers, typically using a ratio of different spectral bands, and then refining these results through manual adjustments to ensure accuracy and precision in delineating glacier extents.",
