            "description": "The reconstruction of the craton by the mantle plume and its subsequent dynamic effects are important scientific issues related to the formation and evolution of the craton. Emeishan Large Igneous Province is located in the western margin of Yangtze craton, which is an ideal window to study the effect of mantle plume on craton reformation. With the support of the national key research and development program \"Deep Process and Resource Effect of Important Yanshanian Events\" (Grant 2016YFC0600400), the mantle deformation characteristics of Emeishan Large Igneous Province were obtained by using teleseismic shear wave (sks, SKKS and PKS) splitting; Combined with the wave velocity structure, geothermal flow and volcanic rock distribution, it reveals the strengthening effect of mantle plume on the craton and the profound influence of the strengthened lithosphere on the present deep process of the southeastern margin of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau; At the same time, it also provides a new perspective for further understanding the origin of seismic anisotropy at the top of the upper mantle and asthenosphere demonstrator interaction.",

                "Tectonic plate motion and mantle convection deform the Earth's mantle, and the resultant orientations of the crystalline lattices of mantle minerals can be inferred from seismic anisotropy (Park & Levin, 2002). Shear-wave splitting of seismic phases converted at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) (such as SKS, SKKS, and PKS, hereinafter referred to as XKS) is used to determine the orientation (inferred from the polarization φ of the fast wave) and the strength (inferred from the delay time δt of the slow wave) of the apparent anisotropy integrated from the CMB to the surface along the raypath and provides insights into the mantle dynamics (Savage, 1999; Silver, 1996). The India-Asia continental collision and shortening in the Cenozoic have driven the lateral extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau along the Ailao Shan–Red River Fault (ARF) in the west Yunnan, SW China (e.g., Chung et al., 1997; Tapponnier et al., 1982) (Figure 1a), and distinct crustal deformations occurred conspicuously across the ARF. Intense E–W shortening occurred to the west of the ARF, and three main sutures (Indus-Yarlung Suture [IYS], Bangong-Nujiang Suture [BNS], and Jinsha Suture [JS]) spanning a width of ∼600 km in central Tibet are shrunken into a narrow zone of ∼200 km in the Three-River Orogenic Zone (TRZ) (Figure 1a)."

At the same time, they yield new insights into the nature of seismic anisotropy in the lithosphere–asthenosphere transition when integrated with geological observations."

Data from 58 broadband seismic stations of the experiment are processed in this study after removing the instrument responses (Reftek-130 dataloggers and Güralp CMG-3ESP seismometers with the frequency range from 30/60 s to 50 Hz). In this study, we conduct a surface wave polarization analysis to estimate possible sensor misorientations (Baker & Stevens, 2004; Stachnik et al., 2012). After the sensor orientation correction, waveforms from events with Mw ≥ 5.5 at epicentral distances of 85°–180°, which include all XKS phases sufficiently, are selected and band-pass filtered in 0.04–0.5 Hz to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the following analysis (Gao & Liu, 2009). We use the SplitLab software package to perform the shear-wave splitting analysis for each XKS phase which can be distinguished clearly in the waveforms (Wüstefeld et al., 2008). Based on reliable splitting measurements, we calculate the station-averaged splitting by stacking the normalized energy maps of individual XKS analysis from the SC method (Wolfe & Silver, 1998), and a statistical F test is conducted to obtain the 95% confidence interval (Silver & Chan, 1991) as a proxy for the corresponding errors (Figure S3)."

Therefore, the spatial correlation of potassic magmatism and strong mantle anisotropy lends the strong supports to the interaction between the southward mantle flow in the asthenosphere, associated with the Cenozoic continental extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau, and the plume-strengthened lithosphere beneath the westernmost Yangtze Craton."
