            "description": "Zhangye basin mainly includes 20 irrigation areas. Under the restriction of water diversion, the surface water consumption of the irrigation area is under control, but the groundwater exploitation is increased, resulting in the groundwater level drop in the middle reaches, resulting in potential ecological environment risks. Due to the complex and frequent exchange of surface water and groundwater in the study area, it is possible to realize the overall water resource saving by optimizing the utilization ratio of surface water and groundwater in each irrigation area.\nIn this project, on the premise of not changing the water demand of the middle reaches irrigation area, the two problems of maximizing the outflow of Zhengyi Gorge (given groundwater reserve constraint) and maximizing the outflow of Zhengyi Gorge (given groundwater reserve constraint) are studied.",

A number of integrated SW-GW models have been developed, such as Hydrogeosphere, MIKE-SHE, MODHMS, ParFlow, CATHY, PAWS1CLM, GEOtop, and GSFLOW.

The proposed approach was applied to optimize the partition of surface water and groundwater in the total irrigation water of ZB’s irrigation districts, such that a better balance between the groundwater storage in the middle HRB and the environmental flow toward the lower HRB can be achieved. In our previous study [Wu et al., 2014], a GSFLOW model was established for the modeling domain (Figure 2a), which adequately simulates the hydrological processes and water budget in the study area.

The water-saving potential essentially stems from the reduction of nonbeneficial evapotranspiration from the aqueduct system and shallow groundwater, and its magnitude largely depends on both water management schemes and hydrological conditions. Overall, this study highlights that surrogate-based approaches like SOIM represent a promising solution to filling the gap between complex environmental modeling and real-world management decision-making."
