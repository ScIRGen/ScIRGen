            "description": "This dataset contains observation data from the Tianjun dense soil moisture sensor network in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB-NET) from September 2019 to July 2023. QLB-NET is deployed within a range of 36 km x 40 km in the Tianjun area of the Qinghai Lake Basin in the northern part of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (N36.9º, E98.96º-N37.61º, E99.336º), covering major soil moisture and freeze-thaw remote sensing product pixels such as EASE-GRID projection of 36 km×36 km (SMAP soil moisture and freeze-thaw products) and 25 km×25 km (SMOS, FY3, and AMSR-E soil moisture products, ESDR freeze-thaw product), and geographic Lat/Lon projection of 0.25º×0.25º(AMSR-2, ESA CCI soil moisture products). The terrain in this area is undulating and diverse, with underlying surface types mainly including alpine meadows (the proportion>90%), alpine swampy meadows, shrubs, wetlands, rivers, etc. QLB-NET consists of a microwave pixel scale network consisting of 60 observation sites, and two enhanced observation areas of 1 km x 1 km, each consisting of 11 observation sites. Each observation site includes three layers of soil moisture (cm³/ cm³), temperature (℃), and electrical conductivity (dS/m) observations at depths of 5cm, 10cm, and 30cm (sensor: CS655). The observation data collection period is 30 minutes, with 48 data per day, and missing data marked as -6999. The released observation data includes: date/time (TimeStamp), soil moisture (VWC5cm, VWC10cm, VWC30cm), soil temperature (TS-5cm, TS_10cm, TS-30cm), soil conductivity (EC-5cm, EC_10cm, EC-30cm), temperature inside the chassis (PTemp Avg), voltage (BattV Min); The data is stored in *. csv format.",

                "As essential variables in land–atmosphere feedbacks at weather and climatic time scales, soil moisture (SM) and soil freeze–thaw (FT) are two relatively active surface parameters that are interrelated and interinfluenced. Moreover, SM and FT are significant to the sustainable development of the regional and global water–land–air–plant–human nexus. In the context of global warming, these two parameters are essential for studying hydrothermal changes in the cryosphere. Their temporal and spatial dynamics can effectively reflect climate changes and substantially impact ecosystem health. The Global Climate Observation System (GCOS) program explicitly includes SM and FT as two Essential Climate Variables. The microwave remote sensing technique is one of the best ways to monitor regional/global SM and FT due to long-term, large-scale, and high-revisit observations, as well as the sensitivity to liquid water content and the capacity to penetrate clouds, rain, and vegetation."

We manually collect data and check the status of each site once a year at the beginning of September (before the soil starts freezing) since most of the area is not covered by wireless communication signals. To calibrate the sensor, we took 109 undisturbed ring-knife soil samples at a 10-cm depth from different sites in September 2019 and July 2020 to obtain the true SM values from the mass difference between the fresh and corresponding dried soil samples."
