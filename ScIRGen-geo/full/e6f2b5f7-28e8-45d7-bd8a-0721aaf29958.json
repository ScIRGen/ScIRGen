            "description": "The data includes tif data and shp documents of urban land cover based on MSS from 1978 to 1985. The classification system includes 10 types of surface cover: cultivated land (10), forest (20), grassland (30), shrubland (40), wetland (50), water body (60), tundra (70), artificial surface (80), bare land (90), glacier and permanent snow (100) (corresponding raster data values in parentheses). Data production includes four steps: satellite image data preprocessing, sample collection, classification, and post-processing. The first three steps are performed on Google Earth Engine, while the fourth step is performed offline. The preprocessing of data includes determining the T1 level images available in MSS Collection 2 within the classification range, removing cloud pollution data and saturated pixels, and generating annual composite data using the median band values of available pixels. The preparation of training samples is mainly achieved through visual interpretation and sample migration based on Euclidean distance (ED) and spectral angular distance (SAD) methods for training samples from 85 years ago. In classification, the first step is to extract sample feature values, including remote sensing indices such as NDVI, NDWI, MBSI, and the median of band values as inputs. A random forest model is trained on every 3 degree grid, and the trained random forest model is used to classify images. The classification results are processed for quality offline. Use an independent validation sample set to test the classification accuracy. Due to severe data loss, the classification results of the Landsat Global Land Survey 1975 dataset, mainly based on the 1972-1983 and a small amount based on the 1982-1987 MSS data integration, were used to supplement the 78-83 years, and the classification results of the Landsat TM 84 and 85 years were filled in. To maintain consistency, the TM classification results were resampled to 60m. Afterwards, the results were merged into the second level based on the Global Administrative Region Dataset (GADM4.1), which corresponds to the prefecture level administrative regions in China. If there is no second level administrative division, it will be merged at the national level, and then urban boundaries will be generated based on impermeable surfaces. The classification results will be cropped using urban boundaries to generate urban land cover within the administrative region. Test the classification accuracy of the final result based on an independent validation sample set. Data format: raster data.tif. Data projection: WGS1984.",
            "instructions": "File Name: The global city wide 60 meter resolution data contains two datasets, namely the city wide shp document and the city wide land cover tif document. The file name in shp format is \"xxxx. shp\" and the accompanying cpg, dbf, prj, shx documents. The file name in raster format is \"xxxx. tif\", where xxxx represents the administrative division name. The second level administrative division using GADM data is globally unified. If a country does not have a second level administrative division, it is directly named after the country's name. For example, Beijing. tif represents this file that describes the land cover situation in urban areas of Beijing. Beijing. shp represents the determined spatial range. Data reading method: All shp files in this dataset can be opened using programs such as ArcGIS that can read. shp files. Raster files can be opened using ArcGIS and various remote sensing processing software. The mainstream data processing tools Python and R can both read the above files.",

Preprocessing involves selecting usable images, removing cloud-contaminated data, and generating annual composite data. Challenges in accurately capturing these changes include dealing with data gaps by supplementing with datasets from other years, ensuring consistency in classification by resampling to a standard resolution, and validating classification accuracy with independent samples. These processes highlight the complexity and the need for rigorous data handling and methodology to reliably interpret land cover changes over time.",

The use of MSS Collection 2 and Landsat Global Land Survey 1975 data to supplement missing data for 1978-1983, and Landsat TM data for 1984 and 1985, pose challenges in maintaining temporal consistency.

The specific objectives behind the chosen data collection techniques, including the use of MSS satellite imagery and the integration of classification systems, are to ensure a consistent and accurate representation of various land cover types. These techniques involve preprocessing satellite images, collecting samples, and classifying land cover using indices like NDVI and NDWI with a random forest model.

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps for preparing and classifying satellite imagery data involve four key stages: satellite image data preprocessing, sample collection, classification, and post-processing. Preprocessing includes selecting available MSS Collection 2 T1 level images within the classification range, removing cloud-contaminated data and saturated pixels, and generating annual composite data using the median of available pixel band values. Sample preparation is achieved through visual interpretation and transferring samples from 85-year-old training samples using Euclidean Distance (ED) and Spectral Angle Distance (SAD) methods. Classification entails extracting sample feature values, such as NDVI, NDWI, and MBSI remote sensing indices, combined with median band values, to train a Random Forest model on a 3-degree grid. This model is then used to classify the images. The classification results undergo offline quality processing, and classification accuracy is assessed using an independent validation sample set. Due to significant data gaps, classification results from MSS data primarily based on 1972-1983 and some from 1982-1987 are supplemented by Landsat Global Land Survey 1975 data for 78-83, and Landsat TM84 and 85 results for 84 and 85 are resampled to 60m for consistency. Finally, results are merged at the second administrative level using the Global Administrative Areas dataset (GADM4.1), or at the national scale if no second-level division exists. Urban boundaries are generated based on impervious surfaces and used to clip classification results, producing urban land cover within administrative boundaries. Classification accuracy of the final results is validated using an independent validation sample set.",
