            "description": "The freeze/thaw status of the near-surface soil is the water-ice phase transition that occurred at the top soil layer. It is an important indicator as a giant on-off “switch” of the land surface processes including water, energy, and carbon exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere. The freeze/thaw status is an essential variable for understanding how the ecosystem responds to and affects global changes. This dataset is based on the AMSR-E, AMSR2 passive microwave brightness temperature data and MODIS optical remote sensing data. The freeze-thaw discriminant function algorithm and downscaling algorithm are used to generate the global near-surface soil freeze-thaw status with a spatial resolution of grids at 0.05° from 2002 to 2017. The dataset can be used for the analysis of the spatial distribution and trend changes of global freeze-thaw cycles, such as the freeze/thaw onset dates and duration. It provides data support for understanding the interaction mechanism between the land surface freeze-thaw cycle and the land-atmosphere exchanges under the context of global changes.",
