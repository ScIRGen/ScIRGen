            "description": "Taking 2000 as the base year, the future population scenario prediction adopted the Logistic model of population, and it not only can better describe the change pattern of population and biomass but also is widely applied in the economic field. The urbanization rate was predicted using the urbanization Logistic model. Based on the existing urbanization horizontal sequence value, the prediction model was established by acquiring the parameters in the parametric equation applying nonlinear regression. The urban population was calculated by multiplying the predicted population by the urbanization rate. The Logistic model was used to predict the future gross national product of each county (or city), and then, according to the economic development level of each county (or city) in each period (in terms of real GDP per capita), the corresponding industrial structure scenarios in each period were set, and the output value of each industry was predicted. The trend of industrial structure changing in China and the research area lagged behind the growth of GDP, so it was adjusted according to the need of the future industrial structure scenarios of the research area.",

                    "Answer": "The population impediment growth model and logistic model provide a structured approach to forecasting population dynamics and urbanization trends, respectively. These models can reveal socio-economic trends by showing how population growth is constrained and influenced by various factors, and how urbanization follows a logistic growth pattern. By analyzing how these models align with historical data, researchers can infer the impact of economic activities, policy changes, and infrastructural developments on population distribution and urbanization. Furthermore, these models allow for the examination of the interaction between population growth and economic development, shedding light on the shifts in industry structure and GDP growth over time.",

                    "Answer": "The logistics model is chosen for predicting urbanization rates because it effectively models growth and saturation patterns, allowing for accurate estimation of urbanization based on historical data and trends. This model fits well with the non-linear characteristics of urban growth and helps in adjusting the parameters through non-linear regression to reflect realistic urbanization scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "If the future population scenarios modeled using the population impeded growth model are realized, urban planning strategies may need to incorporate more sustainable development practices to accommodate population growth. Economic policies might also need to adapt to support a balanced industry structure and ensure that the predicted GDP growth is aligned with the projected urbanization rates. There could be increased emphasis on improving infrastructure, public services, and housing in urban areas, while also considering environmental sustainability and economic resilience.",

These models help forecast the number of urban inhabitants and project the GDP of various counties and cities. By doing so, the research aims to set corresponding industrial structure scenarios based on projected economic development levels, ultimately facilitating informed planning and decision-making.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using a population resistance growth model to predict future population scenarios, with the base year set as 2000. Urbanization rates are forecasted using a logistics model, where parameters are derived through nonlinear regression based on existing urbanization level sequence values to build the prediction model. The urban population is calculated by multiplying the predicted population by the urbanization rate, using non-agricultural population data. The GDP prediction involves using a logistic model to forecast the future GDP of each county and city in the basin. Then, based on the projected economic development level for each period, expressed in per capita GDP, corresponding industrial structure scenarios are set to predict the output value of each secondary industry. Adjustments are made to account for the observed lag in industrial structure changes relative to GDP growth speed.",
