            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with the airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in No. 1, 2 and 3 quadrates of the A'rou foci experimental area on Jul. 7, 2008. The quadrates were divided into 4×4 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. Observation items included:\n     (1) spectrum of stellera, whin and pasture by ASD FieldSpec (350～2 500 nm) from BNU, with 20% reference board. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro), which were recorded daily in detail, and pre-processed data on reflectance were in .txt format.\n     (2) photosynthesis of stellera , whin and pasture by LI-6400. The data were archived in Excel format.\n     (3) surface temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer. 25 corner points of each subsite were chosen and acquisition time, the soil temperature measured three times and the land cover types were archived.\n     Six files were included, the stellera spectrum of diverse coverage, spectrum data for 60% and 65% coverage, stellera photos, photosynthesis, the infrared temperature synchronizing with the airplane, and WiDAS images (resolution: 1.25m, 7.5m and 10m).",
