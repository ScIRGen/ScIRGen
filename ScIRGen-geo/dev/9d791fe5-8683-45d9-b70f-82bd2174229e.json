            "description": "The Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor runs from Golmud to Lhasa. It passes through the core region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and is an important passage connecting the interior and Tibet. The  active layer  thickness (ALT) is not only an important index to study the thermal state of ground in permafrost region, but also a key factor to be considered in the construction of permafrost engineering. The core of GIPL1.0 is kudryavtesv method, which takes into account the thermophysical properties of snow cover, vegetation and different soil layers. However, Yin Guoan et al. found that compared with kudryavtesv method, the accuracy of TTOP model is higher, so they improved the model in combination with freezing / thawing index. Through verification of field monitoring data, it was found that the simulation error of ALT is less than 50cm. Therefore, the ALT in the Qinghai Tibet project corridor is simulated by using the improved GIPL1.0 model, and the future ALT under the ssp2-4.5 climate change scenario is predicted.",

                "Permafrost, defined as ground that remains frozen for two or more consecutive years, shapes approximately 15% of the landmass in the Northern Hemisphere and plays a crucial role in the energy and water cycle in cold regions. Recent field observations have revealed that permafrost is warming at a global scale in response to climate change. The Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau (QTP), referred to by scientists as the Third Pole, has a climate warming rate approximately three times that of the global average, and is drawing increased attention. Permafrost constitutes over 40% of the QTP land area and also sees a thermal degradation in terms of ground temperature warming and active-layer thickness (ALT) increasing. Generally, near-surface (~10e20 m) permafrost thermal conditions respond well to climate change at a regional scale, while local environmental conditions, such as soil characteristics, vegetation cover, topography, could strongly influence the permafrost thermal regime at a local scale. Different approaches have been used to map permafrost for the QTP during the 20th century. With more field observations and remote sensing data available, spatial modeling is becoming an effective approach for investigating and predicting the spatio‒temporal changes of permafrost over the remote QTP. In recent years, equilibrium models or analytical approaches were applied to simulate permafrost distribution and its changes following climate warming. Physically transient models have also been used to quantify the impact of climate change on permafrost conditions and their spatial distributions."
