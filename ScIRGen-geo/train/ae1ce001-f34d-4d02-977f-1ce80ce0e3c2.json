            "description": "The built-up area can reflect the scale, form and actual use of urban construction land in a certain period of time, which provides a basis for analyzing and studying the current situation of land use, rationally utilizing the land in the built-up area and planning the land for urban construction and development. Based on the satellite images covering 34 key nodes from 1999 to 2003 and 2013 to 2014, the supervised and unsupervised data classification process is adopted, and the data driven and knowledge driven are reasonably combined to produce the regional built-up area distribution data of key nodes in 2000 and 2014. The preliminary test shows that the information quality of the built-up area is better than other global information data extracted by automatic processing of earth observation data. In addition, the Balanced Accuracy is 0.83 and the Omission Error is 0.22. The data is raster data in TIFF format, including five unique values of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, in which 0 is NoData, 1 is water surface, 2 is land without built-up area, 3 is built-up area in 2014, and 4 is built-up area in 2000.",
