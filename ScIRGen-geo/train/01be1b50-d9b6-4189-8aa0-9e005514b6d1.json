            "description": "High Asia is very sensitive to climate change, and is a hot area of global change research. The changes of temperature and precipitation will be reflected in the freezing and thawing time of ice and snow. Satellite microwave remote sensing can provide continuous monitoring ability of ice and snow surface state in time and space. When a small part of ice and snow begins to melt, micro liquid water will also be reflected in active and passive microwave remote sensing signals. In the microwave band, the dielectric constant of ice and liquid water is very different, so it provides a basic theory for the microwave remote sensing monitoring of ice and snow melting. In the case of passive microwave, when ice and snow begin to melt and liquid water appears, its absorption and emissivity increase rapidly, so its emissivity, brightness temperature and backscatter coefficient will also change rapidly. This data set is the initial time of ice and snow melting in the high Asia region retrieved by using the satellite microwave radiometer and scatterometer observations from 1979 to 2018. The passive microwave remote sensing data are SMMR on satellite (1979-1987) and SSM / i-ssmis radiometer on DMSP (1988 present). The active microwave remote sensing data is the QuikSCAT satellite scatterometer (2000-2009).",

                    "Answer": "Passive microwave remote sensing is significant in monitoring snowmelt onset because it can detect small changes in the ice and snow surface states. When snow begins to melt, even a small amount of liquid water will significantly alter the dielectric constant, which is reflected in the microwave signals. The emissivity and brightness temperature rapidly increase as snow starts melting, providing a reliable indicator of snowmelt onset. This method allows for continuous spatial and temporal monitoring, crucial for regions like High Mountain Asia that are highly sensitive to climate change.",

                    "Answer": "Passive microwave remote sensing techniques are based on the rapid increase in emissivity and brightness temperature when ice starts to melt and liquid water appears, which is observed using satellite radiometers like SMMR and SSM/I-SSMIS. Active microwave remote sensing, on the other hand, relies on changes in backscatter coefficient detected by scatterometers such as QuikSCAT. The primary difference lies in the type of microwave signal used—emissivity changes for passive sensing versus backscatter changes for active sensing—each providing unique insights into the snowmelt process over time.",

                    "Answer": "Inaccuracies in determining the onset of snowmelt using microwave remote sensing data can be caused by the complex interaction between the dielectric constant differences of ice and liquid water, which affects the microwave signals. Factors such as spatial resolution limitations, atmospheric conditions, and the mixed pixel effect where different surface conditions exist within a single pixel can also contribute to errors. Additionally, variations in snowpack properties, such as grain size and density, might impact the microwave emission and scattering characteristics, leading to potential inaccuracies.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating both active and passive microwave remote sensing data could potentially enhance the accuracy of detecting snowmelt onset in the High Asia region. This is because active microwave sensors, like scatterometers, can provide detailed surface backscatter information, while passive microwave sensors, such as radiometers, can detect changes in brightness temperature associated with snowmelt. The combination of these complementary data sources might improve temporal and spatial resolution, thereby offering a more reliable picture of the snowmelt dynamics in response to climatic changes over time. Additionally, the dielectric contrast between ice and liquid water in these microwave bands could be more effectively captured, leading to better detection and analysis of snowmelt processes.",

                    "Answer": "The main objectives include understanding the sensitivity of the high-altitude Asian regions to climate change by monitoring changes in temperature and precipitation, which are reflected in the timing of snow and ice melt. Satellite microwave remote sensing provides the capability for continuous spatiotemporal monitoring of snow and ice surface conditions. The large difference in dielectric constants between ice and liquid water in the microwave band provides a theoretical basis for monitoring snowmelt. The goal is to detect initial snowmelt when even small amounts of liquid water appear, which significantly alters microwave emission, brightness temperature, and backscatter coefficient, thus providing insights into climate dynamics in this sensitive region.",
