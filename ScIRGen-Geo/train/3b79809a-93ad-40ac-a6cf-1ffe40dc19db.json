            "description": "The dataset includes OSL, magnetic susceptibility and grain size data from the Darai Kalon (DK) loess profile from Tajikistan since the last Glacial period. Samples were collected at 2 cm intervals from the DK section (top 25 m), air-dried in the laboratory, and the 5 g decomposed samples were packed into 10 ml plastic boxes for magnetic susceptibility (χ) measurements. The magnetic susceptibility of low frequency (470 Hz) (χlf) and high frequency (4700 Hz) (χhf) was measured by MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter. This dataset can be used to reveal dust activity, and the results show that dust activity decreases during Heinrich events and increases during interglacial periods.The results show that the climate change between Central Asia and monsoon Asia during the last glacial period shows a phased change of increasing humidity in the interglacial period and decreasing humidity in the glacial period, and the humidity in Central Asia is very sensitive to the millenium scale climate oscillation during the last glacial period.",

                "The abrupt, millennial-scale climatic fluctuations have been identified in a worldwide region. However, it lacks such record in central Asia which is climatically characterized by arid and sensitive to climate change. In the North Atlantic and the surrounding region, more than 20 rapid millennial-scale climatic fluctuations occurred during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. These oscillations, known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, are characterized by an abrupt warming followed by a more gradual cooling. Each D-O event was followed by a succession of progressively cooler interstadials, until the occurrence of a Heinrich (H) event. Simulate studies suggest that the millennial-scale climatic signals can spread to a wide area by atmospheric and oceanic circulations, in which thermohaline circulation plays an important role. Central Asia is featured by scarce water resources, sparse vegetation cover and fragile ecosystems, making it very sensitive to climate change. Recent researches revealed that climate variability in central Asia and the surrounding region was out-of-phase with that of Asian Monsoon during interglacials. Moreover, the climatic combinations were humid hot and dry cold in central Asia on sub-orbital scales. The subsequent study discovered the humidity evolution presented a close link with intensity of Westerlies in central Asia. The intensity of Westerlies is directly forced by North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) rather than solar radiation during the Holocene."

After air-drying in the laboratory, 5 g of disaggregated sample was packed into 10-ml plastic boxes for magnetic susceptibility (χ) measurements. Low-frequency (470 Hz) (χlf) and high-frequency (4700 Hz) (χhf) magnetic susceptibility were measured using a Bartington Instruments MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter. The frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd) was calculated as the formula: χfd = χlf— χhf. The percentage of χfd was calculated as the formula: χfd per cent = 100 per cent × χfd/χlf. In addition, 16 samples, with depth 0.23 m, 0.37 m, 0.77 m, 4.05 m, 6.01 m, 6.85 m, 11.23 m, 12.83 m, 14.77 m, 16.13 m, 16.77 m, 18.73 m, 19.55 m, 21.43 m, 22.75 m, and 23.15 m, from the DK section were selected to separate eolian signals from pedogenic overprint by means of citrate/bicarbonate/dithionite (CBD) extraction. The χlf of CBD treated samples were also measured. Subsequently, we chose the representative samples to make further measurements: magnetic hysteresis loops and thermomagnetic curves (κ-T curve) were determined using a variable field translation balance (VFTB) and Kappa-bridge, respectively.

The millennial-scale climate oscillations are strongly represented and corresponding to North Atlantic region during the Last Glacial, especially from 50 to 30 ka. The magnetic records support that the climate is humid in interstadials and dry in stadials in central Asia. And, the variation of humidity is much more remarkable in central Asia than in CLP which is climatically dominated by Asian Monsoon.

Heinrich events, in which large quantities of icebergs were broken off from the polar ice cap and transported to the Atlantic Ocean, are widely observed in late Quaternary sediments. The region is one of the dustiest in the world and, on average, at least 100 Tg of dust is emitted from this source annually. The close relationship between climate and aeolian dust activity on the orbital scale is widely observed in the region, with strengthened dust activity during glacial phases that weakens during interglacials. In northern Central Asia, which experiences predominantly summer-autumn precipitation, high frequency, low amplitude millennial-scale oscillations have been detected in the particle size record of last glacial loess. Modern process studies have suggested that the source of the dust is predominantly the Afghan-Tajik Basin, transported by near-surface winds, and the particle size variations of bulk samples are controlled by changes in surface pressure centers such as the Siberian High and the Asiatic polar front. On sub-orbital scales, particle-size characteristics are determined in combination by the intensity of transporting winds and distance from the source area as well as the degree of aridity in the source area."
