            "description": "The dataset of soil temperature profile (5cm, 10cm, 15cm and 20cm) observations was obtained in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas from May 27 to Jul. 13, 2008. Diurnal observations were carried out in the bare land near No. 5 building of the resort at 6:00 and 12:00 from May 27 to Jun. 14, and in Yingke oasis No. 4 plot at 10:00 from Jun. 15 to Jul. 13. Besides, intensive observations were carried out at an interval of one hour from 6:00 on Jun. 2 to 6:00 on 3, 2008.",

                    "Answer": "Soil temperature profile observation refers to the systematic measurement of ground temperature at various depths, such as surface, 5cm, 10cm, 15cm, and 20cm, using thermometers. This is done daily to record temperature variations in the soil over a specified period, and it can include specific timings and conditions, such as recording at different times of day or continuously over a 24-hour period, as part of remote sensing experiments.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of specific time intervals and depth levels for soil temperature observations is influenced by the need to capture variations in soil temperature profiles due to daily temperature fluctuations and environmental conditions. In the described observation, measurements were conducted at different times of the day to capture diurnal temperature changes, and different depths were selected to understand the vertical temperature gradient in the soil. Additionally, changes in the observation location and timing, such as moving from a bare ground area to a cornfield and adjusting measurement times, are likely influenced by the need to capture data under different land cover conditions and to accommodate logistical or environmental factors.",

                    "Answer": "Recording soil temperature at multiple depths and times of day can lead to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of soil thermal dynamics, as it captures variations due to diurnal changes and depth-related temperature gradients. This approach allows for detailed analysis of soil temperature profiles and their response to atmospheric conditions, improving the reliability of environmental monitoring datasets. Moreover, having continuous and varied temporal data aids in identifying trends and anomalies in the soil temperature, enhancing the predictive power and applicability of the dataset in modeling and environmental studies.",
