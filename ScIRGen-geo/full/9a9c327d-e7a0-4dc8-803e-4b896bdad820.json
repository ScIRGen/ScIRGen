Based on multi-source remote sensing, simulation, statistics and measured data, and combined with GIS and ecological methods, it quantifies the adjustment service value of Arctic permafrost to the ecosystem, The unit price refers to the correlation (0.35) between the active layer thickness and NDVI changes after excluding precipitation and snow water equivalent, and the grassland ecosystem service value (the unit price of tundra ecosystem service is based on 1/3 of the grassland ecosystem service value).",

The file name is \"yyyydd.txt\", where yyyy represents the year and ddd represents Julian date.\nData reading method: All ASCII code files in the data set can be directly opened with a text program (such as Notepad). Except for the header file, the main content is a numerical representation of the ecological adjustment value of Arctic permafrost changes. If it is necessary to display it with a diagram, it can be opened with Arcgis.

                "Permafrost is a subsurface phenomenon that underlies a significant part of the land and sea in the Northern Hemisphere. Permafrost stores large amounts of organic carbon, affects the stability of bedrock and unconsolidated sediments, and impacts the costs and methods used for infrastructure development. Despite its global significance, there is still no method to reliably detect the occurrence and extent of permafrost at medium to high spatial resolutions and at a global scale. The first comprehensive Northern Hemisphere permafrost extent map was compiled by Brown et al. (1997), based on national and regional maps and expert knowledge from different time periods and sources. High-resolution maps (up to 1km2) have been successfully produced using the TTOP (temperature at the top of permafrost) model for individual regions and countries. The TTOP approach uses only a small number of input parameters and has been successfully employed at regional and continental scales for Canada, Scandinavia, and China."

We employ the MODIS MOD11A1 and MYD11A1 level 3 product in processing version 6, which contains up to two daytime and two night-time measurements per day. Downscaling of the ERA-interim reanalysis data to the 1km2 resolution of individual MODIS pixels is accomplished by computing atmospheric lapse rates and the elevation difference between the ERA orography field and the elevation of a 1km2 pixel. We compare our ensemble MAGT mean to in-situ point measurements in 359 boreholes in the GTN-P and 392 boreholes in the TSP project network. The model calculates mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost based on mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and uses semi-empirical adjustment factors for the effects of snow cover and the thermal offset."
