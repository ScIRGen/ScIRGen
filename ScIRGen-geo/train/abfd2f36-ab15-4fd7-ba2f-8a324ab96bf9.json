            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of the evapotranspiration apparatus on January 1, 2015, solstice, December 31, 2015.The site is located in huailai county, hebei province, east garden town, the underlying surface for corn.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7880E, 40.3491N, and the altitude is 480m.\nThe acquisition frequency of the evapotranspiration permeameter is 1Hz, and the released data is 10min output data.The evapotranspiration meter is a cylindrical structure with a surface area of 1m2 and a buried depth of 1.5m. The observation accuracy of evapotranspiration is 0.01mm.Two evapotranspiration seeptometers were installed, one kept bare soil (lysimeter_1), the other for the corn underlay (lysimeter_2) during the growing season (May 10 - September 15).Soil temperature and humidity probe, soil water potential probe and soil heat flow plate are also installed in the evapotranspiration apparatus.The buried depth of the soil temperature sensor is 5cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm and 140cm.The buried depth of the soil water sensor is 2cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm.The soil heat flux plate is buried 10cm underground;The buried depth of the soil water potential sensor was 30cm and 140cm.Processing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;Due to instruments and weather, the data was abnormal from December 6th to 31st.(2) delete the data of observation anomalies caused during maintenance;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the format of date and time is unified, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 10:30 on June 10, 2015.\nThe observation data released by the evapotranspiration permeameter include:Date/Time, weighing mass (i.l._1_wag_l_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_l_000 (Kg)), seepage mass (i.l._1_wag_d_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_d_000 (Kg)), soil heat flux (Gs_1_10cm, Gs_2_10cm) (W/m2),Multi-layer soil moisture (Ms_1_5cm, Ms_1_10cm, Ms_1_30cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_100cm, Ms_2_5cm, Ms_2_10cm, Ms_2_30cm, Ms_2_50cm, Ms_2_100cm) (%),Multi-layer soil temperature (Ts_1_5cm, Ts_1_30cm, Ts_1_50cm, Ts_1_100cm, Ts_1_140cm, Ts_2_140cm, ts_2_2_5cm, ts_2_2_50cm, Ts_2_100cm, Ts_2_140cm) (℃), soil water potential (TS_1_30 (hPa), TS_1_140 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa));The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Liu et al.

The lysimeter is equipped with soil moisture sensors at depths of 2cm, 10cm, 20cm, and 40cm, soil temperature sensors at 5cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm, and 140cm, soil heat flux plates at 10cm, and soil water potential sensors at 30cm and 140cm. The evapotranspiration measurement precision is 0.01mm. Data collection challenges include ensuring continuous data capture at a frequency of 1Hz (output every 10 minutes) and managing data quality control to handle missing data, instrument malfunctions, or weather-related anomalies. The period from December 6 to December 31 experienced data anomalies due to such challenges. Observational data is processed with quality controls like marking missing data as -6999 and removing data outside physical or instrument limits.",
