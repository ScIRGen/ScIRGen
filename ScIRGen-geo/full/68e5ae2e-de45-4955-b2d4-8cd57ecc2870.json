This method evaluates transportation accessibility by reflecting the transportation situation of a country or region. The index dynamically reflects socioeconomic conditions, thereby revealing a country's development status and assisting in policy formulation, especially in developing countries. These methodologies could benefit from incorporating dynamic socioeconomic data to provide a comprehensive view of a country's development potential.",
