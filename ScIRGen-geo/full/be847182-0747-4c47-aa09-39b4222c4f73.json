Dataset of observation field of shapotou railway vegetation sand fixation protection system (excel)\nPlant and soil information in the vegetation-sand fixation zone established in 1956, 1964, 1981 and 1987.Since the establishment of the observation field, long-term soil moisture and vegetation surveys have been conducted. This database records the soil moisture data after the neutron tube installation in August 2002, the vegetation data from 2003 to 2005 (vegetation structure, herb structure, shrub structure, etc.), and the soil physical and chemical properties data (particle size, total N,P2O5,K2O, hydrolyzed N) of the irregular surveys. \n2. Physiological data set of desert plant stress (excel)\nFrom 2003 to 2005, the physiological and biochemical characteristics of typical plant communities and their dominant species in steppe desert under natural and simulated environmental conditions were analyzed.(including photosynthetic transpiration, fluorescence, biochemistry and other indicators)\n3. Soil infiltration and evapotranspiration data set (excel)\nPrecipitation infiltration process, soil water dynamics and evapotranspiration of fixed sand dunes monitored by desert artificial vegetation using TDR and Lysimeters from 2002 to 2005. \n4. Data set of comprehensive survey on soil and vegetation in the southeastern margin of tengger desert (excel)\nIn 2003-2004, silver (sichuan), yan (latour) highway, silver (sichuan) (state) highway through the tengger desert area, set up along the road of eight samples, 449 samples of soil conductivity, Ph, organic matter, total nitrogen (content) and vegetation (plants, coverage, average height, biomass, strains, coverage, high average, biomass).",

                    "Answer": "Soil water dynamics in the context of desert vegetation regulation refers to the changes and movement of water within the soil profile that are influenced by factors such as vegetation cover, precipitation infiltration, and evapotranspiration processes. It involves the monitoring and analysis of soil moisture levels over time, which are affected by both natural conditions and human interventions like the establishment of vegetation in arid environments.",

                    "Answer": "The use of TDR and Lysimeters for monitoring soil water dynamics and evapotranspiration focuses on precise, continuous measurements of soil moisture and evapotranspiration processes from 2002 to 2005, offering detailed temporal data on artificial vegetation-stabilized dunes. In contrast, the long-term soil moisture and vegetation surveys initiated in the 1950s provide extensive historical data, emphasizing the changes over decades in plant and soil characteristics, which might be less precise in terms of temporal resolution but more comprehensive in capturing long-term ecological trends.",

However, potential challenges might include calibration difficulties, maintenance issues in harsh conditions, and the need for skilled personnel to interpret the data. These factors can affect data accuracy and reliability, especially in complex desert ecosystems.",

For example, neutron tubes are installed to measure soil moisture, while vegetation data such as structure and composition are recorded periodically. Additionally, soil physical and chemical properties are assessed through infrequent surveys, focusing on particle size, total nitrogen, and other key indicators. This data is collected from various periods and organized in datasets for comprehensive analysis.",
