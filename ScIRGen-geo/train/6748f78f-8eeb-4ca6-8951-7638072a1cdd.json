            "description": "The isotopic geochemistry data set of Yanshanian A-type granites in eastern China includes zircon U-Pb geochronology data of Nianzishan, Heilongjiang, balzhe, Inner Mongolia, Xiangshan, yansehu, Xiwanzi, Laoshan, Qingdao, Suzhou, Qingtian, Zhejiang and Kuiqi, Fujian. From 2016 to 2021, systematic zircon U-Pb isotopic geochronology of the Yanshanian A-type granites in eastern China was carried out to explore the petrogenesis of the A-type granites and their relationship with the lithospheric structure and geodynamic background of the Yanshanian in eastern China, and to reveal the principle of isotopic fractionation and its main controlling factors in the differentiation and evolution of the A-type granites.",
