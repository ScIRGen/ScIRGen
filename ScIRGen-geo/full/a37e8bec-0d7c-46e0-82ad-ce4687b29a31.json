            "titleEn": "A Dataset of Critical Phenological Date of Winter Wheat and Summer Corn in the North China Plain (1982-2015)",
            "description": "Crop phenology refers to the date when a crop reaches a critical growth period. The main planting pattern in the North China Plain (NCP) is the rotation system of winter wheat and summer maize. Changes in the key phenological periods of winter wheat and summer maize reflect the response and adaptability of them to climatic conditions and production management measures. And the critical phenology dates are important parameters for evaluating crop growth status and irrigation water consumption in the NCP\n    This study selected the winter wheat-summer maize stable planting area in the NCP. The GIMMS3g NDVI data from 1982 to 2015 was used. Multiple characteristis such as the maximum value, minimum value, slope, and percentage value of the curve were combined to extract phenology of winter wheat and summer maize: SOS (start of the season), PEAK (peak of the season), and EOS (end of the season). The extracted phenology was compared with the phenological records from the agro-meteorological stations. The R² was above 0.9, which was with high accuracy. (Details can be found in the reference)\n    The phenological dataset can be applied to related researches about calculating the productivity of winter wheat and summer maize, evaluating the response of crops to climate change, and estimating irrigation water consumption in this region.",
            "instructions": "(1) Naming of winter wheat files: The phenology dataset is raster data and is stored in ASC files. The phenological period includes the SOS (start of the season), PEAK (peak of the season), and EOS (end of the season) of the winter wheat growing season. There are 102 images from 1982 to 2015. The file name is \"SOS/PEAK/EOS_WW_xxx.asc\", where \"SOS/PEAK/EOS\" is the phenological period, \"WW\" stands for winter wheat, and \"xxx\" is the year. For example, \"PEAK_WW_1990.asc\" is the peak day of winter wheat in 1990. In particular, the SOS of winter wheat in this dataset is the beginning of the spring growing season, which basically corresponds to the green-up date, rather than the actual sowing date. PEAK and EOS basically correspond to the heading and maturity dates of winter wheat.\n(2) Naming of summer maize files: The phenology dataset is raster data and is stored in ASC files. The phenological period includes the SOS (start of the season), PEAK (peak of the season), and EOS (end of the season) of the winter wheat growing season. There are 102 images from 1982 to 2015. The file name is \"SOS/PEAK/EOS_SM_xxx.asc\", where \"SOS/PEAK/EOS\" is the phenological period, \"SM\" stands for summer maize, and \"xxx\" is the year. For example, \"PEAK_SM_1990.asc\" is the 1990 summer corn peak day. SOS, PEAK and EOS basically correspond to the seven-leaf date, heading date and maturity date of summer maize.\n(3) Data usage method: All ASCII files in this dataset can be opened directly with a text program (such as Notepad). The ASC file header information includes nrows(123), ncols(103), xllcorner, yllcorner, cellsize and NODATA_value . ASC files can also be loaded in ArcGIS software, or read in MatLab using the \"arcgridread\" command. The grid value is the phenology day.",
