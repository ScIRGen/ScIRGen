                "Both anthropogenic water regulation and groundwater lateral flow essentially affect groundwater table patterns. As an important part of the hydrological water cycle, fresh water plays an essential role in providing water resources for human activities in all aspects, such as the water used for irrigation, forestry, aquaculture, and livestock in the agricultural sector; the water used for cooling, heating, and electricity generation in the industrial sector; and the water used for washing, drinking and catering in the domestic sector. However, with human population growth and economic development, human freshwater intake from both surface and subsurface sources is becoming more severe to meet rapidly increasing water demand, regardless of the effect. Many studies have shown the negative effects of excessive water withdrawal on the socio-economy, freshwater systems, and eco-hydrological environment. Even climate and the carbon cycle can be changed by the influences of excessive water withdrawals on soil moisture. A common way to study anthropogenic water regulation is to use land surface models or water resource models, such as the Community Land Model (CLM), Simple Biosphere Model, Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, Common Land Model, Water Global Assessment and Prognosis, and PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB), which include comprehensive and specific descriptions of vertical fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere, as well as bio-geophysical and bio-geochemical processes. Nevertheless, descriptions of land hydrology remain relatively simple in such land surface models, despite their representation of very complicated processes, such as vegetation phenology and carbon-nutrient cycles. Until now, most land models still treat hydrological processes only in the vertical direction and ignore lateral exchange of water and energy in both the soil and aquifer. Although this approximation may be satisfactory in some cases, when studying the effects of human actions regarding water resources, simplified models may produce considerable errors in predictions because the anthropogenic activities and lateral hydrological processes are inseparable. Over-exploitation of groundwater leads to a decline of the groundwater table, and depression cones near wells are commonplace in these regions. The changed groundwater heads cause changes in lateral flow, which naturally transports groundwater from surrounding areas to the local groundwater depressions. Lateral flow plays a critical role in offsetting the loss of locally stored water, and in relieving the negative effects of overexploitation on the eco-hydrological system. The interaction between human activity and regional groundwater confirms that the effects of anthropogenic water withdrawal and use cannot be studied in isolation. Therefore, models that incorporate a scheme to describe lateral flow can give a more realistic representation of groundwater table patterns, compared to models that exclude this component."

Over the last decade, anthropogenic groundwater exploitation deepened the water table by approximately 2 m in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin and rapidly reduced the terrestrial water storage, while irrigation increased soil moisture by approximately 0.1 m3 m23. The water stored in the mainstream of the Heihe River was also reduced by human surface water withdrawal. The latent heat flux was increased by 30 W m22 over the irrigated region, with an identical decrease in sensible heat flux. The simulated groundwater lateral flow was shown to effectively recharge the groundwater depletion cone caused by over-exploitation. The offset rate is higher in plains than mountainous regions."
