            "description": "In this paper, the Ba isotopic compositions of the Fogang I-type granite (~ 160mA), the Nankunshan A-type granite (~ 160mA) and the DARONGSHAN Shiwandashan S-type granite (~ 230ma) in South China are analyzed in detail °~ twenty-six point five °， 104 east longitude °~ one hundred and seventeen °。 Isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation. The whole rock samples were crushed to less than 200 mesh without pollution, and the powder was digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin. Then the barium isotope was tested by MC-ICPMS. The international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. The obtained Ba isotopic data provide important information for the Ba isotopic composition of granite reservoirs.",

The use of technologies like MC-ICPMS for isotopic analysis after sample preparation, including acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation, is critical. The use of internationally recognized standard samples for data monitoring also supports accurate isotopic analysis.",
