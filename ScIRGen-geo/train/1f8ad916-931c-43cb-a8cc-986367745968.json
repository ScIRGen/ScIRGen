The Keketale VMS Pb Zn (- Ag) deposit provides an opportunity to solve the above problems; Five ore samples from No.7 and No.9 orebodies were crushed and screened for lead isotope analysis of bulk minerals, 17 polished thick sulfide samples were used for in-situ trace element and sulfur lead isotope analysis, 66 trace element determination points were analyzed, and 25 sulfur isotope points were determined; A total of 18 point pairs of different minerals were selected for lead isotope analysis, and LA-ICP-MS method was used",
