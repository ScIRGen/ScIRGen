            "description": "This data set includes the annual mean values of total suspended solids concentration, chlorophyll a concentration and water eutrophication index TSI of lakes in 6 periods, including 1990, 1995, 2002, 2005, 2010 and 2015. The data sources are: Landsat 5 and Landsat 8. Method of use: Based on the analysis of the relationship between spectral reflectance and synchronously measured total suspended solids concentration, an empirical method is used to select the best band combination to establish a total suspended solids concentration algorithm for lakes on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau to obtain the total suspended solids concentration, R ² Is 0.76. Similarly, the algorithm of chlorophyll a concentration in Qinghai Tibet Plateau lakes is established to obtain the algorithm of chlorophyll a concentration in water bodies.",

These algorithms' validation results show a high degree of accuracy, with R² values of 0.83 for total suspended solids and 0.72 for chlorophyll-a. Additionally, the transparency-based TSI calculations depend on the retrieval accuracy of chlorophyll-a and transparency, with validation accuracies of R²=0.80 for transparency and R²=0.72 for chlorophyll-a.",

                    "Answer": "Using empirical methods based on spectral reflectance can lead to the development of algorithms to estimate lake water quality parameters such as total suspended matter concentration and chlorophyll-a concentration with certain accuracy levels. For example, the accuracy of the total suspended matter concentration algorithm can reach R²=0.83 with an RMSE of 1.08 mg/L, while the chlorophyll-a concentration algorithm achieves R²=0.72 with an RMSE of 0.49 μg/L. These methods can thus provide reliable estimates of these parameters, which can be further used to compute the Trophic State Index (TSI) of the lakes. However, the accuracy of the TSI is contingent upon the accuracy of both the transparency and chlorophyll-a concentration retrievals, which are key inputs to the TSI calculation.",

                    "Answer": "Advancements in satellite imaging technology, like those in Landsat 5 and Landsat 8, enable the accurate collection and analysis of water quality parameters by providing high-resolution spectral reflectance data. This data allows researchers to analyze the relationship between spectral reflectance and concentrations of total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a in lakes. By selecting optimal band combinations and using empirical methods, algorithms can be developed to estimate these water quality parameters with high accuracy, as evidenced by the validation results with R² values of 0.83 for total suspended solids and 0.72 for chlorophyll-a.",
