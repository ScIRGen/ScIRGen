            "description": "This data set is a collection of statistics on major geological disasters in the Himalayas, the study area starts in Zada County, Guer County of The Ali region in the west, the east side is bounded by the Yalu-Zanbu River, the northern boundary is the Yalu-Zanbu River break, south to the vast Himalayan region of the national boundary. The Himalayas are located in the southwest of China, the southwest of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the world's largest, highest and youngest mountain range, the world's highest peak Mount Qomolangma is located here. Here the geological structure is complex, seismic activity is frequent, the new tectonic movement is strong, the internal and external dynamic geological action is very active, is one of the most serious geological disasters in China. The original data of the data set is digitized from the report of the Remote Sensing Survey of Major Geological Disasters in the Himalayas, and the total number of disaster statistics is more than 540, including three types of disasters: landslides, mudslides and glacial final lake collapses. This data set provides basic data for the study of disaster reduction and prevention in the Himalayas region of Tibet, and is of reference value for research in related fields.",
            "instructions": "The data set is divided into two parts, table data and geographical mathematics.\nThe table data is stored in Excel format and contains six workbooks, including landslide disaster statistics table, landslide disaster list, debris flow disaster statistics table, debris flow disaster list, glacier moraine lake outburst statistics table and glacier Moraine Lake Outburst Hazard list in county-level area. The statistical table includes the statistics of geological disaster level of each county and district, and the list includes the name, longitude and latitude, scale, basic form and other information of geological disaster.\nGeographic data is the visualization result of table data, which is stored in ShapeFile format.",
