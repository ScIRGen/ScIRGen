                    "Answer": "The systematic sampling interval of approximately 20 centimeters suggests a need for high precision and granularity in data collection to capture detailed changes in sedimentary layers. This granularity is crucial for identifying subtle changes in magnetic and geochemical properties that are indicative of the uplift processes of the Tibetan Plateau and the evolution of arid environments in inland Asia. Such detailed interval sampling allows researchers to construct a comprehensive magnetic stratigraphy and paleoenvironmental record over the late Cenozoic era.",

These samples are subjected to low-frequency (470 Hz) and high-frequency (4700 Hz) magnetic susceptibility tests using a Bartington MS-2 magnetometer with an MS2B sensor. The analysis includes drying the samples in a low-temperature oven before testing. The tests yield mass-specific and frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility data, which are analyzed to understand the magnetic stratigraphy and paleoenvironments.",
