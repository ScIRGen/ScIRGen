            "description": "This dataset contains the LAI measurements from the Daman superstation in the middle reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from June 24 to September 16 in 2022. The site (100.376° E, 38.853°N) was located in the maize surface, near Zhangye city in Gansu Province. The elevation is 1556 m. There are 4 observation samples, each of which is about 30m×30m in size. Four sub-canopy nodes and one above-canopy node are arranged in each sample. \nThe data is obtained from LAINet measurements; the four-steps are performed to obtain LAI: the raw data is light quantum (level 0); the daily LAI can be obtained using the software LAInet (level 1); further the invalid and null values are screened and using the 5 days moving averaged method to obtain the processed LAI (level 2); for the multi LAINet nodes observation, the averaged LAI of the nodes area is the final LAI (level 3).\nThe released data are the post processed LAI products and stored using *.xls format.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Qu et al. (2014) for data processing) in the Citation section.\n",

This technology enables the collection of high-resolution temporal data, which can be processed into meaningful indices like the leaf area index, ultimately aiding in understanding vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes in specific regions like the Heihe River Basin. By processing this data through several levels, from raw data to averaged observations, researchers aim to produce reliable indicators of vegetation health and variability over time, which are crucial for ecological and environmental modeling.",

The data collection process involves automatic acquisition of light data at each node every hour on a daily basis (Level0). This raw data is then processed using LAINet software to calculate the daily leaf area index at each node (Level1). The process includes identifying and filling in invalid values and applying a 5-day moving average to eliminate the impact of weather changes on LAI calculation (Level2). For observation sub-areas with multiple LAINet nodes, the average of the nodes is considered as the final observation value for that sub-area (Level3).",
