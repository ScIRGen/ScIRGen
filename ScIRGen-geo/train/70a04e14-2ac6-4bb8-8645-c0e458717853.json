One belt, one road area, is evaluated for flood risk in extreme areas. The data provide basis for local government departments to make decisions, and early warning before flood disasters, so that we can gain valuable time to take measures to prevent and reduce disasters, and to reduce the loss of lives and property of people caused by floods.",

We first expanded the rasterized national and sub-national boundaries to cover NoData areas (such as sea areas and other water bodies) with a 2 arc-degree buffer, using the Euclidean Allocation tool in ArcMap 9.2. Next, we created a land mask by combining cells from both population datasets used, and national boundary data. This land mask was then used to set non-land cells to NoData. To compile the GDP per capita (PPP) dataset (Data Citation 1), we first put together a full national GDP dataset, drawn from the most recent World Bank Development Indicators database 32. For missing countries (see Supplementary Information), we used data from the CIA’s World Factbook 33, except for one administrative unit, namely French Southern Territories, for which no data was found and regional average data was used (see below). The constant 2015 international US dollars of CIA fact sheets were converted to constant 2011 international US dollars, the unit in which national GDP from World Bank was given. For that we used the standard method documented by the World Bank39. Temporal interpolation followed the same method as for national values. The data were extrapolated over time by scaling the last available value to reflect subsequent national changes, and similarly scaling the first value with preceding changes. After deriving both national and sub-national tabulated data, we first created a raster dataset of these two spatial scales for each time step, and then combined the two raster datasets, which resulted in the final GDP per capita (PPP) raster dataset provided here. To estimate the total GDP (PPP) of each grid cell, we multiplied the GDP per capita (PPP) by grid specific population data using two different spatial resolutions: 5 arc-min (10 km at equator) (Data Citation 1) and 30 arc-sec (1 km at equator) (Data Citation 1). To compile the HDI dataset (Data Citation 1), we first produced a full national HDI dataset, based on the data from the Human Development Reports by UNDP 30 (Table 3). After deriving both national and sub-national tabulated data, we first created raster datasets of these two scales for each time step, and then combined the two rasters, resulting in the final HDI raster dataset provided here. To estimate the error originating from the interpolation and extrapolation to fill the missing data entries, we performed an error analysis separately for national and sub-national level data."

A dataset mentioned uses a weight of 0.8 for hazard and 0.2 for vulnerability, suggesting that hazards are considered to have a more significant impact on risk. This weighting reflects an expectation that hazards like extreme precipitation directly contribute more to disaster risk compared to vulnerability factors, which might be more context-dependent.",
