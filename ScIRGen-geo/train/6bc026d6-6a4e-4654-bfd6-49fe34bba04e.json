            "description": "Using ICESat-2 lidar altimeter data and the empirical equation derived from self-affine theory, the lake volumes with an area greater than 0.01 km2 on the Tibetan Plateau in 2022 were estimated. The study found that the simulated and in-situ lake volumes were in good agreement, with an average absolute percentage error of 8.0% for the maximum lake depth and 19.7% for the lake volume. It is estimated that the total water storage of lakes larger than 0.01 ㎡ on the Tibetan Plateau in 2022 was 1043.69±341.31 km³, with approximately 70% (~734.8 km³) of the lake water storage concentrated in the Inner Plateau (Qiangtang Plateau). This data preliminarily clarifies the water storage of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau based on remote sensing methods, providing important data support for the prediction of future lake water volume changes, water balance analysis, and water resources management.",
