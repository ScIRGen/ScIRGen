            "description": "Paleozoic carbonate sequences are well developed along the road from the Leiwuqi County to the Jiangda County, Changdu, eastern Tibet. Preliminary Devonian-Carboniferous biostratigraphy studies based on macro-fauna (e.g. brachiopods and corals) have been conducted by previous researchers, but high-resolution subdivision and correlation is still lacking in study area. For example, Upper Devonian Zhuogedong Formation and Lower Carboniferous Wuqingna Formation exists near Tuoba and Wuqingna village. Abundant conodonts, rock and geochemical samples from the Nuoma section in Tuoba, Karuo District, Changdu have been collected, which was assigned to the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary interval by geological survey. Our studies would provide precise biostratigraphic correlation in this area and have important significance for redefinition of the DCB GSSP. This dataset includes the stratigraphic column and outcrop photo of the Nuoma section in Changdu (GPS coordinates: 97°49’53.06’’ E, 31°27’2.94’’ N). According to the conodont data, the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary is tentatively placed within the interval between 141 m to 188 m in this section.",

It typically includes information based on field descriptions and can be supplemented with photographs. In this specific field, it aids in identifying the boundary between Devonian and Carboniferous systems, particularly through biostratigraphic indicators such as conodont data.",

                    "Answer": "Applying high-resolution conodont and geochemical sampling methods to carbonate strata could significantly enhance the resolution and precision of biostratigraphic studies in regions like Nuo Ma Village. This approach may refine the stratigraphic correlations across the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, improve the accuracy of global boundary stratotype section and point (GSSP) studies, and provide a more detailed understanding of sedimentary and geochemical processes during that time period. The increased precision could also facilitate better comparisons with other regions and contribute to a more comprehensive global stratigraphic framework.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of Devonian-Carboniferous boundary strata, detailed conodont and geochemical sampling methodologies involve comprehensive fieldwork to collect samples from carbonate rock formations. This includes identifying and documenting stratigraphic sections through field descriptions, creating stratigraphic columns, and capturing photographic evidence. The precise boundary between the Devonian and Carboniferous periods is determined using biostratigraphic data, especially conodont fossils, which provide higher precision in correlation. The fieldwork in the specified region, such as near Nuoma Village, involves sampling across the boundary at depths ranging from 141m to 188m, based on internal geological survey data, to enhance the accuracy of biostratigraphic correlation and contribute to global stratigraphic studies.",
