The dataset extracted from the altimetry observation data of ICESat satellite from 2003 to 2009 through the screening criteria constructed by the evaluation label and ranging error model, in order to provide global high accuracy elevation control points for topographic map or other scientific fields relying on good elevation information. It has been verified that the elevation accuracy of flat (slope<2°), hilly (2°≤slope<6°), and mountain (6°≤slope<25°) areas meet the accuracy requirements of 0.5m, 1.5m, and 3m respectively.",

                "HIGH-ACCURACY elevation information is important for many scientific applications, such as polar glacier monitoring, terrain deformation monitoring, and topographic mapping. Airborne LiDAR can observe the Earth’s surface with high accuracy and density, but the high cost of data acquisition and the subsequent processing mean that this approach has difficulty in global-scale applications. With spaceborne laser altimetric observations, the data can be expected to provide high-accuracy elevation information worldwide. Satellite stereo imaging technology can also provide topographic maps. Spaceborne laser altimetric observations can provide high-precision elevation information worldwide, which is beneficial to satellite stereo imaging technology to generate high-quality topographic maps worldwide. As early as the 20th century, spaceborne laser altimetry technology was utilized for deep space exploration for mapping the terrain or supporting image stereo mapping. The laser altimeter carried on the ICESat mission with the 2003–2010 operation was the first nonexperimental laser ranging instrument for observing the Earth continuously. Its main scientific goal is polar glacier monitoring, but it has also achieved a wide range of applications in other scientific fields, including topographic mapping and biomass estimation. However, in the ranging and range-elevation processing, there are some influencing factors, such as atmospheric conditions, attitude accuracy, instrument noise, and within footprint roughness, resulting in an uncertain laser footprint (LF) elevation accuracy."

                "We proposed a method by comprehensively analyzing the laser ranging error and evaluation labels to extract high-accuracy elevation control points that is suitable for satellite imagery-based topographic mapping applications. Therefore, a new method is required to extract accurate LF, to adapt to the satellite imagery-based topographic mapping applications in different terrains, especially for the regions where ground control points are difficult to acquire. To overcome such limitations, there are two contributions in this article. The first, a method of extracting high-accuracy elevation control points by comprehensively analyzing the laser ranging error and evaluation labels, is proposed. The second, a global high-accuracy laser altimetry dataset using ICESat as a foundation is developed."

However, due to the influence of the base-to-height ratio, platform stability, and so on, this technology is difficult to achieve the above accuracy without ground control points, especially the elevation accuracy. However, in the ranging and range-elevation processing, there are some influencing factors, such as atmospheric conditions, attitude accuracy, instrument noise, and within footprint roughness, resulting in an uncertain laser footprint (LF) elevation accuracy. The main source of these datasets is the ICESat altimetry data. However, the majority of these methods can only eliminate the impacts of the surface reflectance and atmospheric effect. They are not suitable for extension to regions with higher slopes or artificial objects, or vegetations. Moreover, the overall filtering criterion applied in these kinds of methods is too strict that it leads to fewer available data, which means that the spatial distribution in some scenes is sparse, resulting in low mapping accuracy. The learning-based method is reliant on the spatial distribution of the training samples, and it is difficult to apply globally."

                "First, remove outliers due to atmospheric scattering or other situations. The orbit/attitude data were also analyzed to remove low-quality LFs. Reference DSM is used to eliminate the LF outliers with elevation difference larger than 50 m. LFs with attitude accuracy labeled as 100 in the GLAH14 dataset were also removed as a small error of the orbit/attitude may induce large footprint elevation changes in steep areas. Second, the laser ranging error was estimated through a ranging error model and combined with several waveform quality labels to purify the LFs. For each LF provided by ICESat, a circular region with a radius of 50 m, plus the LF’s major axis semi-diameter, is constructed based on the planimetric geolocation of the LF. In the circular region, a concentric circle with a radius of 50 m is the footprint center search point area, in which the search points are evenly distributed with an interval of 1 m. Taking each search point as the center, an elliptical area is constructed according to the ellipse parameters (long axis, eccentricity, and direction angle) of the LF. By comparing all the search points’ simulated echoes with the original echoes corresponding to the LFs, the center of the ellipse region that corresponds to the simulated echo with the highest similarity is regarded as the real planimetric geolocation of the LF."

For land areas, except for areas of water, snow/ice, and polar ice sheets, the dataset can provide the elevation control points for worldwide satellite topographic mapping using high spatial resolution imageries or other science research that depend on accurate Earth’s elevation information. We further used airborne LiDAR data from six study areas around the world to carefully validate the datasets’ accuracy."

Compared to the raw dataset, the proportion of footprint elevations that conform to the accuracy standard (0.5 m @ slope< 2◦,1 . 5m@2 ◦ ≤ slope < 6◦,a n d3m@6 ◦ ≤ slope < 25◦) is increased from 68.24%, 59.97%, and 26.52% to 87.58%, 90.04%, and 83.91%, respectively.
