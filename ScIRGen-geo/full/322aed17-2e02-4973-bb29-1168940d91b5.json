This data set consists of the reconstructed paleoenvironmental evolution data by using many methods such as granularity, environmental magnetism, mineralogy, element and isotope geochemistry, organic geochemistry, and palynology, based on the Cenozoic sedimentary records from the eastern Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent area (Tarim, Qaidam, Hoh Xil, Nangqian, Jinchuan, Xining, Lanzhou, Binxian and Shilou). The paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental information (such as palaeoelevation, paleotemperature, paleohumidity, paleovegetation, and climate events) provide important data support for discussing the dynamic mechanisms and links among the chemical weathering and paleoclimate, the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, global change and the orbital periodic changes.",

                "Continuous and accurately dated sediment records from the Asian interior are pivotal to a better understanding of the evolutionary history of Asian inland drying and the associated driving mechanisms. The Asian inland drying is generally regarded as a coupling consequence of land-sea-atmosphere interaction, which could be dated back to the early Eocene and significantly enhanced since the late Oligocene-early Miocene. The driving mechanism appears to correspond closely with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, the retreat of the Para-Tethys Sea, and global cooling with Cenozoic development of bipolar glaciations and continental ice sheets. Especially during the Neogene-Quaternary, the regional drying and eolian dust activity have been greatly enhanced in the Asian interior. However, intensive tectonic activity since the late Oligocene-Early Miocene in the northern Tibetan Plateau and the Central Asian orogenic belt yields much coarser lithology with frequent changes in sediment facies in basin sequences, which hinders a better understanding of the full range of aridification and its driving force using the basin sediment records. The Qaidam Basin, an inland arid area in the northeast Tibetan Plateau, is dominantly under the influence of the middle-latitude westerlies, with its southeast corner being impacted by the East Asian monsoons, thus providing the ideal area to reveal tectonic-climate linkages in terms of aridification of the Asian interior."

We thus integrated new data of carbonate Mn concentration from the SG-1b core (7.3 – 1.6 Ma) with the previous SG-1 Mn records to reconstruct a continuous history of paleolake and climate evolution in the western Qaidam Basin since 7.3 Ma."

A total of 619 bulk samples of the SG-1b core were selected for geochemical analysis. Samples were oven-dried at 40 °C and ground into fine powder (<200 mesh). Approximately 0.5 g of each sample was leached by 10 ml 1M HOAc at room temperature for 24 h to extract Mn in the carbonate fraction of the samples. Concentrations of Mn, Ca, Mg, and Sr in the acetic acid leachate were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Leeman Labs Prodigy-H). To obtain the major minerals (especially carbonate minerals in the core), we chose seven representative samples of SG-1b core for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a Rigaku D/MAX-2000 diffractometer (Cu, Kα, 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 100 mA, 3–35°, step 0.02°,1 0°/min) at the Micro Structure Analytical Laboratory, Peking University."

                "The XRD results show that major minerals in the sediments of SG-1b core include quartz, albite, orthoclase, carbonate minerals (calcite, aragonite, dolomite, and ankerite), mica or illite, and chlorite (Figure 3). The concentration of Ca in acetic acid leachates (Ca HOAc) mainly represents the calcium carbonate and some Ca-bearing salt minerals (e.g., gypsum) content in the sediments. Consequently, the measured Ca concentrations reflect the calcium carbonate content below 232 m and an upper limit of the calcium carbonate content above 232 m. The MnHOAc variation reveals an upward decrease above ∼240 m and a long-term relative stable content with several fluctuations below ∼240 m (Figure 4). The MnHOAc concentrations present long-term fluctuations of regional climate. The integrated MnHOAc record is especially more synchronous with the North Atlantic Ocean SST (Figure 5), suggesting that the reduction of westerlies moisture caused by high-latitude cooling of the Northern Hemisphere directly affects the aridification of the Qaidam Basin. The recurrence analysis has been successfully used to determine the climate state transitions using high-resolution proxy records, e.g., the Cenozoic climate (Westerhold et al., 2020) and the Quaternary climate in the Qaidam Basin (Han et al., 2020). The result of recurrence analysis of the integrated MnHOAc record shows three major transitions at 6.2 Ma, 5.3 Ma, and 2.6 Ma. The 5.3 Ma change, i.e., at about the Miocene/Pliocene boundary, is a transition stage from the prior drying stage to the subsequent wetting stage in the Qaidam Basin, which is consistent with global warming at that time (Figure 5). The system change at the Pliocene/Quaternary boundary (2.6 Ma) marks the onset of prolonged and extensive Quaternary drying in the Qaidam Basin, which is contemporaneous with the intensification of the North Hemisphere glaciation. Therefore, global change and northern hemisphere high latitude processes could modulate the Asian inland climate at orbital time scales, which is also supported with other studies of high-resolution Quaternary records in the SG-1 core (e.g., Han et al., 2020)."

                "The Linxia Basin on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau in northwest China bears continuous and thick lacustrine-fluvial sediments with environmental significance to central Asian aridification. Climate change since the mid-Oligocene in central Asia has been specifically interesting as it is a critical period in the growth of the Tibetan Plateau. Many researchers believed that the arid conditions in continental Asia had developed as a result of the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. The Linxia Basin lies topographically at the intersection of the East Asian monsoon region, the arid region of northwest China, and the alpine region of the Tibetan Plateau. Lipid biomarkers have been suggested as effective indices for climate change, as they can contain a rich diversity of information about the composition of biotic precursor molecules and the environmental conditions. However, uncertainty exists while using n-alkane proxies owing to their physical, chemical, and biological effects. The microbial community is sensitive to environmental changes and can be useful for paleoclimatic studies owing to their diverse ecological roles. However, lipid biomarkers can only infer the biological origin of some specific groups and therefore, have limitations in studying the diversity of microbial community. With the development of modern molecular biological techniques, several recent studies have applied sedimentary DNA to reconstruct temporal changes in microbial ecology."

It is noteworthy that the relative abundance trends of two classes of microbes (Proteobacteria and Firmicutes) were negatively correlated. Furthermore, the increasing Firmicutes and the relatively decreasing Proteobacteria at approximately 8 Ma also corroborated this arid event. In addition, during this period, there was an extremely low abundance of archaea, which might correspond to severe climatic conditions around 8 Ma. Therefore, this study suggests that the microbial communities could serve as a potential tool for the reconstruction of paleoenvironments."

In the Mediterranean, the Messinian salinity crisis ended across the MPB. In a global context, the MPB marks a transition from a late Miocene cooling trend to the early-to-middle Pliocene Warm Period. It coincided with an atmospheric CO2 concentration rise of ~100–250 ppm, an increase with similar amplitude to the current rise due to anthropogenic emissions. The early-to-middle Pliocene Warm Period was the most recent period of persistently warmer-than-present conditions. During this warm interval, the Northern Hemisphere was largely ice-free and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were comparable to present-day levels. Detailed analysis of the MPB, therefore, enables investigation of the large-scale climate response to a natural atmospheric CO2 increase and global warming over equilibrium timescales for comparison with rapid out-of-equilibrium present-day responses. Today, Asia has wet monsoonal regions to the south and east of the Tibetan Plateau and arid continental regions to the north and west of the Tibetan Plateau. Both the Asian monsoon and the Westerlies are critical components of the global atmospheric circulation; they play a key role in the global climate system, impacting surface ocean circulation and driving air-sea heat, moisture, momentum fluxes, and carbon exchange. Our present understanding of Asian climate variability and dynamics relies primarily on Quaternary results, when a bipolar icehouse climate state was fully established and global climate was colder than today, with waxing and waning Northern Hemisphere ice sheets on orbital timescales."

Here, we investigate Asian monsoon responses to the MPB global warming event and orbital forcing during the late Miocene–middle Pliocene in a global context by providing ~1–2-kyr resolution ~4.7-Myr-long proxy records (Al/Na, Rb/Sr, and lightness) spanning continuously from ~8.1 to ~3.4 Ma from the Shilou aeolian red clay succession on the eastern CLP.

                    "Answer": "The effectiveness of using ancient DNA and n-alkanes in reconstructing paleoenvironmental conditions can be considered promising as they provide detailed insights into the climatic conditions over extended periods, such as the past 29 million years in the Linxia Basin. These proxies can reveal information about organic matter sources and microbial community changes, offering a complementary perspective to traditional geochemical analyses. However, challenges such as the uncertainty in using n-alkane proxies due to physical, chemical, and biological effects and the limitations in studying microbial community diversity solely through lipid biomarkers must be acknowledged.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing magnetostratigraphy and orbital tuning techniques for dating deeper sediment cores, such as in the SG-1b core from the Qaidam Basin, is generally reliable for establishing continuous timelines. However, challenges may include dealing with coarser lithology due to tectonic activity, which can cause frequent changes in sediment facies and impact dating precision. Furthermore, aligning magnetostratigraphy with orbital tuning requires high-resolution data and careful cross-validation with other dating methods to ensure accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating high-resolution proxy records with climate model simulations can significantly enhance our understanding of historical climatic events, as demonstrated in studies investigating the Miocene-Pliocene boundary warming and Asian monsoon responses. Proxy records provide empirical data on past climate conditions, while simulations can offer insights into the dynamics and mechanisms driving these changes. This combined approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of climatic events, such as the impact of CO2-induced warming and orbital forcing, and helps in understanding the broader implications for global climate systems.",

This combined approach allows researchers to link sediment records to tectonic activities and climate changes, such as those influenced by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and associated aridification. Geochemical data can reveal past climates, while geophysical measurements help understand the sediment deposition processes, enhancing the understanding of tectonic-climate linkages.",

                    "Answer": "Paleoclimate proxies, such as rubidium-to-strontium ratios and magnetic susceptibility measurements, are used to infer past climate conditions and their responses to orbital forcing. These proxies are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and can reflect variations in monsoon strength and precipitation patterns over time. By measuring these proxies in sedimentary sequences, researchers can identify cyclic patterns that correspond to known orbital cycles, such as eccentricity, obliquity, and precession, allowing for the reconstruction of climate variability on orbital timescales.",
