            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Linze station-Linze grassland flight zone on Jul. 11, 2008.\n     Intra-band data available for general users include Level-2C data (after geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections), Level-1B browse image (after intra-band matching) and Level-2B browse image (after registration). The raw data, Level-1A, and data processing parameters were filed; applications would be evaluated prior to access. Data processing started in Aug. 2008 and ended in Apr. 2009, and in Nov. 2009, CCD data were reprocessed to adjust radiometric calibration. \n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id\n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 1#13 || 1500m || 1:52:06 || 11:58:02 || 90 || processed; compelete || good || Pingchuan reservoir\n|-\n| 2 || 1#11 || 1500m || 12:11:38 || 12:09:54 || 95 || processed; compelete || good || Linze grassland station\n|-\n| 3 || 1#9 || 1500m || 12:14:58 || 12:20:42 || 87 || processed; compelete || good || Pingchuan reservoir\n|-\n| 4 || 1#7 || 1500m || 12:27:14 || 12:33:18 || 92 || processed; compelete || good || desert transit zone\n|-\n| 5 || 1#5 || 1500m || 12:38:22 || 12:44:14 || 89 || processed; compelete || good || north-south desert plot\n|- \n| 6 || 1#3 || 1500m || 12:50:30 || 12:56:26 || 90 || processed; compelete || good || Pingchuan reservoir\n|-                      \n| 7 || 1#1 || 1500m || 13:01:46 || 13:07:46 || 91 || processed; compelete || good || Linze station\n|}",

                    "Answer": "The necessity for geometric correction, radiometric calibration, and atmospheric correction in airborne sensor data collection methods arises from the need to ensure accuracy and reliability of the data. Geometric correction is required to rectify distortions due to the sensor's movement and varying altitude. Radiometric calibration is necessary to translate raw sensor data into meaningful physical quantities by accounting for sensor-specific characteristics and environmental conditions. Atmospheric correction is crucial to remove the influence of atmospheric conditions on the recorded data, ensuring that the data reflect the true surface characteristics. These processes contribute to producing reliable Level-2C products, which are essential for accurate analysis and application.",
