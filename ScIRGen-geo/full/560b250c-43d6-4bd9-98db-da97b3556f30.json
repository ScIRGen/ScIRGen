            "description": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key parameter in the hydrologic cycle and energy cycle parameters. Over the years, thermal infrared-based models is the main methods for generating ET products. Although spatia-temporally continous land surface temperature (LST) products have been developed to drive the thermal infrared model, spatial gaps still occured when applying these model to large regions due to data missing and cloud cover. Therefore, in this study, we drived TSEB-SM model across China to estimate ET and developed a resonstruction strategy (DNN-ETo) to fill the spatial gaps. This reconstruction framework, combining the deep nerual network (DNN) and reference ET (ETo), is a two-step process for reconstructing ET. This ET product based on TSEB-SM and DNN-ETo method have achieved complete coverage across China. Besides, the accuracy of this ET product had been validated at 20 EC sites which including various landcover types, and indicated a good performances with a average bias of -0.17 mm day-1 and average RMSE of 1.02 mm day-1. Otherwise, the results of evaluation also suggested that this ET product was able to accurately respond to changes in vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation caused by soil moisture stress in arid and semi-arid regions of China.\nThe dataset (spatial-temporal continuous evapotranspiration product across China from 2001 to 2020) include evapotranspiration (ET), Transpiration (T) and Evaporation (E). This dataset was stored by a Network Common Data Form (NetCDF), with a temporal and spatial resolution of daily and 0.01°, covering the entire China region and spanning the period 2001.01.01-2020.12.31. For the convenience of the researchers, this study provides data not only at the daily scale, but also at the monthly and annual scales.\n",

                "The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model using the land surface temperature (LST) as a key boundary has been used to estimate land surface evapotranspiration (ET) over various landcovers and environmental conditions. Energy balance models using the land surface temperature (LST) as a key boundary condition have been applied to estimate convective and radiative exchange across the land-atmosphere interface. The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model proposed by Norman et al. (1995) has been shown to address key convective and radiative exchange processes for many complex canopies, additionally partitioning the ET into E and T. In the original TSEB model, the value of Priestley-Taylor coefficient αPT is initially assumed to equal its classic value of 1.26, and the value would decline as the canopy became water stressed which would be indicated by a modeled derived elevated soil temperature resulting in a negative daytime soil latent heat flux or condensation due to soil sensible heat flux exceeding the soil surface available energy, which is a non-physical solution during daytime convective conditions. The soil and canopy water use not only affects their kinetic temperatures which are estimated via the radiometric temperature observation, the key boundary of the TSEB model, and both temperatures are correlated to atmospheric demand and the soil moisture content affecting the evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from plant stomata."

However, under advective conditions where energy is being added beyond the available energy (net radiation less soil heat flux) the TSEB model is unable to account through any iterative solution for this additional evaporative demand but is shown to be related to the vapor pressure deficit (Agam et al., 2012). This can result in an underestimation of T and ET being underestimated under such advective conditions (Song et al., 2016)."

The soil moisture and temperature were measured at various depths (2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 cm) under the ground; here, the soil moisture measurement at 4 cm depth was used to calculate the soil stress factor for soil evaporation.

The magnitude of the TSEB-SM improvements were larger early and late in the growing season and in arid areas, consistent with soil moisture improving estimates of ET particularly under times of higher water stress.

                    "Answer": "Thermal infrared-based models often encounter challenges due to cloud cover, which can obstruct satellite observations, leading to data gaps. Additionally, they tend to have a positive bias in estimating evapotranspiration under soil water stress conditions. On the other hand, using soil moisture data from satellites like SMAP can improve the model's performance during periods of high water stress by providing more accurate boundary conditions for soil moisture. However, satellite soil moisture data may require downscaling to match the spatial resolution of thermal infrared data, which can introduce its own set of challenges.",

                    "Answer": "Inaccuracies or spatial gaps in estimating evapotranspiration using thermal infrared models over large regions are mainly caused by cloud interference and data loss. These factors can lead to missing spatial information when the model is applied across extensive areas.",

Sensible and latent heat fluxes are measured by eddy covariance systems, and soil moisture and temperature are measured at various depths. The soil moisture measurement at a specific depth is used to calculate the soil stress factor for evaporation.

                    "Answer": "Scaling local evapotranspiration measurements to larger regional datasets presents challenges due to spatial variability in land cover, soil moisture conditions, and atmospheric demand. These issues can lead to difficulties in extrapolating point measurements to broader areas. To address these challenges, integrating in-situ measurements with remote sensing data and employing models like TSEB-SM, which incorporate soil moisture stress indices, can improve the accuracy of scaled estimates. This method can better capture the spatial and temporal variability of evapotranspiration across different landscape scales.",

This enhancement results in more accurate modeling of latent heat fluxes, particularly in drought-prone regions where water availability is limited.

This information was integrated into the TSEB-SM model, which enhances the accuracy of soil evaporation and plant transpiration estimates over diverse soil moisture conditions.",
