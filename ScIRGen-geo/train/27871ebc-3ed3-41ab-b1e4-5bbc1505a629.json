            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of 10m tower self-moving meteorological station on January 1, 2016, solstice, December 31, 2016.The station is located in east garden town, huailai county, hebei province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7880E, 40.3491N, and the altitude is 480m.\nThe automatic weather station is installed on a 10m tower, the acquisition frequency is 30s, and the output time is 10min.The observation factors include air temperature and relative humidity (5m), and the direction is due north.The wind speed (10m), the wind direction (10m), the direction is due to the north;Air pressure (installed in waterproof box);Rainfall (10m);The four-component radiation (5m), the direction is due to the south;The infrared surface temperature (5m), the arm is facing south, and the probe is facing vertically downward.The soil temperature and humidity probe was buried at 1.5m to the south of the meteorological tower. The buried depth of the soil temperature probe was 0cm, 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm. The buried depth of the soil moisture sensor was 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 10cm, 10cm, 10cm, 20cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm.The average soil temperature was buried 2,4 cm underground.Soil hot flow plates (3) are buried in the ground 6cm.\nProcessing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) eliminate the moments with duplicate records;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the format of date and time is unified, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2016-6-10-10:30.During January 1, solstice, April 15, there was a problem with the soil temperature sensor with a depth of 40cm, and the data was missing.\nGuo et al, 2020 is used for site introduction and Liu et al, 2013 for data processing",
