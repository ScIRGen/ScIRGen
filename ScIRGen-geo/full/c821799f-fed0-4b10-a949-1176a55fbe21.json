            "description": "A standardized field survey was carried out from August to September 2020 in the source areas of rivers and lakes in Tibet Autonomous Region. A total of 25 samples and 75 quadrats were investigated. The data set includes sample number, plot number, latitude and longitude, altitude, aboveground biomass, species number and coverage of the plot, and the data format is Excel. The area volume of collected and investigated samples was 100cm*100cm, and each sample site had 3 quadrats named Plot1, Plot2 and Plot3. All data were collected and measured in the field, and the quality of data was ensured in the field survey according to the vegetation survey specifications. This dataset provides theoretical basis for rational utilization of grassland resources and data support for comprehensive evaluation of environmental effects of typical land use change.",
