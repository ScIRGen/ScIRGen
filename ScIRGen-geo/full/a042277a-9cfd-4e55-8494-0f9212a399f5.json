The data is from Zhang et al. (2018), and the specific algorithm is shown in the article. The source data range is global, and the Qinghai Tibet plateau region is selected in this data set. This data integrates the original 4-day time scale data into the monthly data. The processing method is to take the maximum value of the month, so as to achieve the effect of removing noise as much as possible. This data set is often used to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of vegetation greenness and primary productivity, which has practical significance and theoretical value.",
