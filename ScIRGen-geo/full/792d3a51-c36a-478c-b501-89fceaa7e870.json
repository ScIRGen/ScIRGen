For cropland products, the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) is used along with prior knowledge such as phenology and crop types to set production rules. For building land products, NDVI, NDBI, and MNDWI indices are utilized, supplemented by DEM and nighttime light data to establish production rules. Accuracy is assessed using high-resolution imagery and field survey data, as shown by the precision evaluation of the 2015 products, which had accuracies of 89.43% for cropland and 91.89% for building land.",
