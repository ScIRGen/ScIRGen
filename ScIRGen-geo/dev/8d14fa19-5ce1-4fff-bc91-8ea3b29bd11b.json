            "description": "This dataset includes the BRF observations of the corn in the Daman site (100.372° E, 38.855° N) on 29-6-2012) and the desert site around the airport (100.700° E, 38.762° N) acquired on  8-7-2012.\nInstruments: SVC-HR1024 from IRSA, reference board from IRSA, the multi-angular auto-observing shelf developed by BNU\nMeasurement methods: we measure the BRF in the unit of observing plane, i.e. fix the view azimuth then change the view zenith angle to measure the target spectra, including along the principle plane and cross the principle plane at different sun angle. Besides, the planes along and cross the ridge of corn are also measured, specific planes like 0° , 90° away from the north are also observed in the desert. In each observing plane, view zenith angles from -60° to 60° with a interval of 10° are observed. The fiber optic probe with a view field of 25° is fixed at the multi-angular shelf at a height of 5 meters. The spectrum measured by the SVC-HR1024 is ranged from 350 nm-2500 nm. In each plane measurement , the spectral radiance of the reference board  is measured first, then the target radiance of different view zenith angle is measured, finally the reference  board radiance is measured again.\nDataset contains the originally recorded data like the spectra (in sig format) and the log files (in txt format), and the processed data BRDF (in txt format and jpg format). The processed data in the format of txt, contains the observing geometries and corresponding reflectance spectra from 350 nm to 2500 nm. The processed data in the format of jpg, is a quick view of the BRF at 550 nm, 650 nm and 850 nm of each observing plane.",

                    "Answer": "BRDF, or Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function, is a function that defines how light is reflected at an opaque surface. In the context of ecological and hydrological remote sensing experiments, it is measured using instruments like the SVC-HR1024 spectrometer and a reference panel, along with a multi-angle automatic observation rack. The measurements involve observing spectral data across multiple angles within specific azimuth planes, such as those parallel and perpendicular to the solar principal plane, with zenith angles ranging from -60° to 60° at 10° intervals. This process includes initial and final measurements of the reference panel's radiance for calibration purposes, ensuring accurate reflection data relative to the reference panel.",

This approach focuses on capturing directional reflectance by measuring both the reference panel and the target object, which may differ from other spectrometers that might focus on different spectral ranges or angles. The SVC-HR1024 covers a spectral range of 400nm-2500nm, which provides a broad spectrum for detailed BRDF analysis, potentially offering more comprehensive data compared to spectrometers with a narrower spectral range.",

                    "Answer": "Employing multi-angle data measurements using a spectrometer can enhance the accuracy and reliability of BRDF datasets by providing a more comprehensive representation of surface reflectance properties. The method allows for capturing variations in reflectance based on different viewing angles, which is crucial for accurately modeling the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). This approach can lead to improved calibration of remote sensing data, better understanding of surface properties, and more accurate environmental monitoring and modeling. Additionally, the systematic approach of using reference panels and multiple viewing angles enhances the precision of the measurements, reducing potential errors and biases.",

This approach helps in understanding the surface albedo and anisotropy, which are crucial for analyzing land surface processes and improving the accuracy of remote sensing data interpretations.",
