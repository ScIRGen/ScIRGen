            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Huailai station eddy covariance system (EC) from January 14 to December 31 in 2020. The site (115.7880° E, 40.3491°N) was located in the maize surface, near Donghuayuan town of Huailai city in Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The EC was installed at a height of 5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500A) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1 (level 0: Δst<30 and ITC<30), class 2 (level 1: Δst<100 and ITC<100), and class 3 (level 2: Δst>100 and ITC>100), which represent high-, medium-, and low-quality data, respectively. In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. \nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2015) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "The use of atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulent similarity characteristics (ITC) as quality assessment criteria suggests that the dataset prioritizes accurate representation of atmospheric conditions by filtering out data that do not meet specific stability and turbulence thresholds. This implies an underlying rule that stable and similar turbulent conditions are crucial for reliable data, possibly due to their impact on the accuracy of flux measurements like sensible and latent heat, as well as CO2 fluxes.",

These steps lead to more reliable 30-minute averaged data, improve the quality rating of sensible and latent heat flux measurements, and filter out data affected by instrumental errors or unsuitable atmospheric conditions, such as those caused by precipitation or low turbulence at night.",

Additionally, quality evaluation of flux values is performed, focusing on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data filtering includes removing data with instrument errors, excluding data one hour before and after precipitation, discarding data with more than 10% missing in 30-minute intervals, and excluding nighttime data with weak turbulence (u* less than 0.1m/s).",
