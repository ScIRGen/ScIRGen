            "description": "This data set was collected in summer 2017 during the ground-based microwave radiometry experiment, which is part of the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR). The experiment site is located in Duolun County, Inner Mongolia (116.47°E, 42.18°N, at 1269 m in altitude). The data set contains three parts, namely brightness temperature data, soil data and vegetation data. The microwave brightness temperature data was observed by a vehicle-mounted dual-polarized multi-frequency radiometer (RPG-6CH-DP), including the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarization brightness temperatures at L-, C- and X-bands. The brightness temperature data were acquired from 30° to 65° with an interval of 2.5°, and the time resolution is 0.5 hours. Soil data contains 5 layers of soil moisture and soil temperature (2.5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) over three croplands (corn, oats, and buckwheat), with sampling intervals of 10 minutes. The soil data also contains soil surface roughness, rainfall, irrigation flags, and soil texture. Vegetation data contains leaf area index, plant height, vegetation water content, etc.\nThe experimental period lasted from July 19 to August 30, 2017, and it provided important data for the land surface microwave radiation modeling and validation, as well as the development of soil moisture retrieval algorithms.",

                "Soil moisture (SM) is a vital variable in hydrological, biological and geochemical processes, and it plays an important role in energy exchange between land surfaces and the atmosphere. Eﬃcient SM monitoring can support various applications, such as crop growth monitoring, drought assessment, flood warning, evaporation estimation, and numerical weather forecasting. Unlike traditional manual in situ measurements, passive microwave remote sensing has a great advantage in estimating the surface SM at a global or regional scale. Among the diﬀerent wavelengths of microwave sensors, L-band radiometry is one of the most eﬀective techniques for monitoring the SM due to its proper penetration into vegetation and soil layers. Currently, satellites carrying the L-band radiometer include the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The SMOS mission launched in November 2009 is the first mission to map global SM by using L-band observations. SMOS has multi-angular observation capability, which can provide more information about surface microwave radiation. The SMAP mission was launched in January 2015, which incorporated a radar and a radiometer. The mission concept is to combine the complementary attributions of the radar and radiometer observations to enhance the resolution of SM."

However, its retrieval requires a penalty on parameter constraints since the input brightness temperatures at horizontal and vertical polarization are correlated. The LPRM has a poor performance at incidence angles less than 30°, as it analytically utilizes the polarization difference in the brightness temperature, which is quite small at lower incidence angles."

The DCA does not rely on the auxiliary vegetation information and can also achieve good performance for both the soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The accuracy of four soil moisture algorithms achieve their best performances at intermediate incidence angles of 40° to 45°, and is slightly degraded when the incident angles increased to larger than 50°, which is contributed to the increasing vegetation effects and depolarization that leads to an information loss. These findings provide quantitative evidence to help understand the differences in various current soil moisture algorithms and further promote the development of new methodologies for future soil moisture missions."
