            "description": "The active layer is one of the main characteristics of permafrost. It melts in warm season and freezes in cold season, showing seasonal changes. The amount of water content in the active layer has certain influence on the temperature of the permafrost, thus affecting the stability of the permafrost.The data set is mainly composed of active layer moisture data. The monitoring station is located at 92°E, 34°N, with an elevation of 4600m. The monitoring site is flat, the vegetation type is alpine meadow, and the water probe used by Beilouhe Meteorological Station is CS615. The data set is used to monitor water at 5 depths below the surface, 10 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm, 80 cm and 160cm. The time interval of the data set is 1 day and is 30 minutes.Mean value of data once, data is stable and continuous during monitoring.By combining the data of soil heat flux and frozen soil temperature, the thermal change process and mechanism of active layer can be carried out.",

                    "Answer": "'活动层水分监测数据集' refers to a dataset focused on monitoring the water content of the active layer, which is a characteristic of permafrost that melts during warm seasons and freezes during cold seasons, affecting the temperature and stability of the permafrost. The dataset involves water content measurements taken at various depths below the surface at a meteorological station located at 92°E, 34°N, at an altitude of 4600 meters, in a flat area with alpine meadow vegetation, using moisture probes like the CS615.",

                    "Answer": "The periodic changes in water content measured at depths of 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, and 160cm can reveal insights into how moisture influences the temperature of permafrost. This data, collected with a CS615 moisture probe at a meteorological station located at 92°E, 34°N at an elevation of 4600 meters, helps researchers analyze the seasonal melting and freezing cycles of the active layer. Understanding these cycles is essential for studying the thermal dynamics and stability of permafrost, as the presence and amount of water can significantly affect soil temperature and, consequently, the stability of the permafrost. By examining the daily averaged data, scientists can explore scientific questions related to the heat variation processes and mechanisms of change within the active layer.",

                    "Answer": "Collecting soil moisture data at varying depths with consistent time intervals allows for a comprehensive understanding of moisture distribution and seasonal changes. This can improve the accuracy of permafrost studies by providing detailed insights into how moisture content affects soil temperature and, consequently, permafrost stability. Regular data collection ensures that temporal changes are captured, which can help in identifying patterns and predicting future changes in permafrost characteristics.",
