            "description": "In this data set, major and trace elements of peridotite standard samples pcc-1 and dts-2b developed by the national geological survey of the United States and three peridotite samples from eastern China were analyzed by XRF, ICP-MS and LA-ICPMS. The whole rock samples were crushed to less than 200 mesh without pollution, and then the main and trace elements were determined by XRF and ICP-MS. Then the molten glass was made and the trace elements were tested by LA-ICPMS. Complete sample fusion, especially for samples with acid resistant minerals (spinel and rutile), as well as long-term preservation of glass, allows infinitely repeated measurement of microbeam technology. The same method can also be used to analyze other mantle rocks, such as eclogite and pyroxenite. The test analysis will be completed from 2020-01-31 to 2021-05-31.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of instruments such as XRF, ICP-MS, and LA-ICPMS is driven by their ability to effectively analyze major and trace elements in mantle rock samples. XRF and ICP-MS are used for testing major and trace elements after the samples are finely ground to avoid contamination. LA-ICPMS is employed for trace element testing in fused glasses, which allows for repeated microbeam measurements, especially for samples with acid-resistant minerals like spinel and rutile.",

                    "Answer": "The use of different analytical instruments such as XRF, ICP-MS, and LA-ICPMS can lead to variations in the accuracy and repeatability of microelement data due to their differing sensitivity and precision levels. XRF and ICP-MS are used for primary microelement testing, while LA-ICPMS is used for microelement testing of molten glass, allowing for detailed analysis of trace elements. The complete fusion of samples, especially those with acid-resistant minerals, and the long-term preservation of glass enable unlimited repeated measurements with microbeam technology. This comprehensive approach ensures high precision and repeatability in geochemical analyses.",

This approach allows for detailed compositional analysis of mantle rocks and the potential for application to other rock types like eclogite and pyroxenite. The use of glass fusion aims to facilitate long-term preservation of samples, allowing for repeated microbeam technique measurements.",
