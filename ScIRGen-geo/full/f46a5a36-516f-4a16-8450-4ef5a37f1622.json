            "description": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS analysis of whole rock geochemical composition, TIMS whole rock SR Nd isotopic composition analysis results show that subalkaline intermediate basic volcanic rocks and I-type rhyolites belong to the same magmatic series, which are widely developed in the whole basin fault depression evolution process; With the thinning of lithosphere and the intensification of basin extension, the intermediate basic volcanic rocks show the characteristics of alkaline OIB type, and form a typical bimodal association with A-type rhyolite. The evolution characteristics of volcanic rock assemblages in Songliao basin are similar to those of Cenozoic volcanic rocks in North American basin range province, which reflects the gradual transition of mantle source area from enriched lithospheric mantle to asthenosphere mantle, which is closely related to basin evolution and lithospheric thinning in extensional setting. The data comes from the scientific research project \"deep process and resource effect of Yanshanian major geological events\" (2016YFC0600404).",

                    "Answer": "TIMS全岩Nd同位素组成分析 refers to a data collection method using Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) to analyze the neodymium isotopic composition of whole rock samples. This technique is used to obtain precise isotopic data, which can provide insights into the age, origin, and evolution of geological materials, such as the sub-alkaline intermediate-basic volcanic rocks and I-type rhyolites in the Songliao Basin.",

                    "Answer": "XRF and ICP-MS methods are employed to analyze the geochemical composition of volcanic rocks, offering detailed elemental data. In contrast, TIMS analysis focuses on Nd isotopic composition, providing insights into isotopic variations. While XRF and ICP-MS can rapidly analyze a wide range of elements, TIMS is generally more precise for isotopic studies. Both methods complement each other, with XRF and ICP-MS providing a broader geochemical context and TIMS delivering high-precision isotopic data. The combination of these techniques in the Songliao Basin research enhances the understanding of volcanic rock characteristics by offering a comprehensive geochemical and isotopic profile.",

                    "Answer": "The evolution of volcanic rock compositions in the Songliao Basin from subalkaline to alkaline characteristics during the Early Cretaceous period is caused by the thinning of the lithosphere and the increasing degree of basin extension. This geological process led to the transition of the mantle source region from an enriched lithospheric mantle to the asthenospheric mantle, which is reflected in the geochemical data obtained through XRF and ICP-MS methods.",

                    "Answer": "Using XRF and ICP-MS methods to analyze the geochemical composition of volcanic rocks helps reveal that the sub-alkaline intermediate-basic volcanic rocks and I-type rhyolites from the Songliao Basin belong to the same magmatic series, consistently developing throughout the basin's fault depression evolution. This analysis shows that as lithospheric thinning and basin extension intensified, the intermediate-basic volcanic rocks exhibited alkaline OIB-type characteristics, forming a typical bimodal assemblage with A-type rhyolites. These findings facilitate a deeper understanding of the transition in mantle source from enriched lithospheric mantle to asthenospheric mantle, closely related to basin evolution and lithospheric thinning under extensional settings.",

                    "Answer": "The goal is to understand the evolution of volcanic rock compositions in the Songliao Basin, which reflects the transition of mantle source regions from enriched lithospheric mantle to asthenospheric mantle. This understanding is crucial for studying the basin's tectonic evolution, lithospheric thinning, and extension processes, and for drawing parallels with similar volcanic compositions in the North American Basin and Range Province. The research is part of a national key research project focused on deep geological processes and resource effects during the Yanshanian period.",
