This dataset is based on the global 0.5 ° climate dataset published by CRU and the global high-resolution climate dataset published by WorldClim. It was downscaled in China using the Delta spatial downscaling scheme and validated using data from 496 independent meteorological observation points. The validation results are reliable. The unit of temperature is 0.1 ℃; With high accuracy and relatively new time, it can currently provide a scientific basis for the research on the background of geological disasters on the Qinghai Tibet Highway, and can be applied to more atmospheric, geological, and geographic related fields in the future.",

The Loess Plateau (LP) in China is the most developed loess region in the world in terms of extent, thickness, and depositional sequence; it has an area of approximately 0.64×10^6 km^2 and assumes important service functions in China in terms of ecology and economy (Chen et al., 2015). Over the last 50 years, the annual precipitation has decreased and the air temperature has increased over the LP (Bi et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2015). These changes can damage the LP by altering its water availability and increasing the instances of soil erosion, droughts, and floods (Miao et al., 2016)."

Although dynamic downscaling can provide a mechanism for interpreting regional climate change and output many climate variables, this technique requires numerous inputs and computational requirements and sometimes cannot present reliable climate change information at fine scales."

Although meteorological observation networks are increasingly incorporating data from a greater number of weather stations and contributions from an increasing number of governments and researchers around the world, observation networks still suffer from low station density and spatial resolution, especially in mountainous areas, where the installation and maintenance of weather stations are challenging. Proxy monthly temperature (TMP) and precipitation (PRE) data products are released by several climate research organizations such as the general circulation models (GCMs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), and Willmott & Matsuura (W&M). Although CRU products offer the advantage of reflecting long-term climate effects, their low spatial resolution (30′, approximately 55 km) limits their ability to reflect the effects of complex topographies, land surface characteristics, and other processes on climate systems. China has a large area with abundant mountainous regions. As a result, even the establishment of additional weather stations has not fully satisfied the requirements for long-term, high-spatial-resolution climate data, especially at finer geographical scales and for mountainous areas. Furthermore, most weather stations in China were established after 1950, and thus long-term observational climate data are lacking."

This process will result in various complications due to drought for plant growth, crop yield, and other human activities. China is home to multiple climate zones that host important agricultural regions and other societally important activities that are likely to be affected by increased drought. Several indexes have been employed to investigate long-term drought, including the standardized precipitation index, the Palmer drought severity index, and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Unlike the standardized precipitation index, the SPEI considers changes in both the precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration induced by temperature. The SPEI also allows for multiple temporal scales, unlike the Palmer drought severity index.

We also found that, compared with the past (1901–2017), the climate in the future (2018–2100) will tend toward significant droughts, although both periods showed a high spatial heterogeneity across China. Moreover, the proportion of areas with significantly decreasing SPEI trends was far greater than the proportion of those with increasing trends in most cases, especially for northwestern and northern China. Finally, the proposed approach to quantifying precipitation and PET contributions performed well according to logical evaluations. The percentage contributions of precipitation and PET on SPEI variability varied with study periods, representative concentration pathway scenarios, trend directions, and geographic spaces. In the past, PET contributions for significant downward trends and precipitation contributions for significantly upward trends accounted for 95% and 72%, while their future contributions were 57±22%–149 ±20% and 95 ±27%–190 ±58%, respectively."
