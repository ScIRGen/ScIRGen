            "description": "Objective: To explore the prevalence and factors associated with frailty and pre-\nfrailty in elderly Chinese patients with hypertension.\nBackground: In China, there have been few national studies into the prevalence and\nfactors associated with frailty and pre-frailty in elderly patients with hypertension.\nMethods: Through the 4th Sample Survey of Aged Population in Urban and Rural\nChina (SSAPUR) in 2015, the situation of hypertension subjects aged 60 years or\nolder in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China\nwas obtained. And the frailty index was constructed based on 33 potential defects,\nelderly hypertensive patients are classified as robust, frailty, and pre-frailty.\nResults: A total of 76,801 elderly patients with hypertension were enrolled in the\nstudy. The age-sex standardized prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in hypertensive\nelderly in China was 16.1% (95%CI 15.8–16.3%), 58.1% (95%CI 57.7–58.4%). There\nwere significant geographical differences in the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty\nin elderly hypertensive patients. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed\nthat poor economic status, activities of daily living disability, and comorbid chronic\ndiseases were related to frailty and pre-frailty.\nConclusion: Frailty and pre-frailty are very common in elderly Chinese patients\nwith hypertension and have similar risk factors. Prevention strategies should be\ndeveloped to stop or delay the onset of frailty by targeting established risk factors\nin the pre-frailty population of elderly hypertension. It is also crucial to optimize the\nmanagement of frailty in elderly Chinese patients with hypertension.",

                "At least 50% of older adults suffer from hypertension, and the prevalence of hypertension in the elderly over 80 years is close to 90%. Hypertension is the foremost independent risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and even cardiovascular death in older adults. Frailty is a non-specific state of progressive decline in the function and reserve of multiple systems, diminished homeostatic regulation of the body, and decreased compensatory capacity for physiological adaptation in response to stress in the elderly. Global community of elderly frail prevalence was 4–59%, and the average prevalence was 11%. A meta-analysis revealed that frail older hypertensive patients had a higher risk of death, hospitalization, and falls than older hypertensive patients who were not frail. Studies have shown that frailty is a factor that must be considered in setting target blood pressure levels for elderly patients with hypertension. European Society of Hypertension, European Geriatric Medicine Society, and the 2019 Chinese Guideline for Hypertensive elderly all clearly emphasize that frailty assessment as a concern in the management of hypertension in the elderly."

Content from the 4th SSAPUR, a cross-sectional study of elderly subjects aged 60 years or older from 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China was obtained. The number of samples collected by SSAPUR was 224,142, of which 15,756 (7.0%) were excluded because the number of constructed FI items was less than 28. Among the 208,386 older individuals, 76,801 physician-diagnosed elderly patients with hypertension were enrolled in our study. We constructed FI following Searle’s standard procedure. SPSS 24.0 software was used for analysis. Missing data were interpolated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple fill method. Age-sex standardized prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty among elderly patients with hypertension in China was calculated according to the weights created in our study. We assessed the significance of differences by ANOVA or Student’s t-test for continuous variables and by the χ2 test for categorical variables. Multinomial regression analysis were used to ascertain the factors associated with frailty and pre-frailty, including comorbidities, ADL disability, southern or northern China, age group, sex, nationality, residence location, education level, marital status, living alone, economic status, medical insurance, the convenience of medical expense reimbursement."

Our large nationally representative sample study found that frail older hypertensive patients were older and had higher rates of hospitalization in the past year, ADL disability and comorbid chronic diseases compared to non-frail older hypertensive patients. These characteristics suggest that frail older hypertensive patients are prone to adverse events. We found that the frailty prevalence of older hypertensive patients in the economically underdeveloped western and northern regions was relatively high, while the economically developed coastal areas were relatively low."

                    "Answer": "Collecting data from a diverse range of regions in mainland China presents several challenges. There is significant regional variability in economic development, healthcare access, and demographic factors, which can introduce biases. The study found differences in frailty prevalence between economically developed coastal areas and underdeveloped regions, which could complicate data interpretation. Additionally, logistical challenges in reaching remote areas and ensuring consistent data collection methods across varied settings may pose difficulties. These factors must be carefully managed to ensure the data's validity and representativeness.",
