It applies remote sensing and GIS technologies following a 1:100,000 scale thematic mapping requirement. This method is particularly designed to reflect aspects such as area size, dune mobility, and fixed degree. Compared to other remote sensing techniques, the Landsat TM method may offer a standardized approach, particularly suitable for large-scale mapping and thematic cartography, but may differ in resolution or detail captured compared to more advanced or higher resolution remote sensing technologies.",
