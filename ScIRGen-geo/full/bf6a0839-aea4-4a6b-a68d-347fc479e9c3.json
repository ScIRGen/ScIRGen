            "description": "Based on the monthly precipitation data of 262 rain gauges, WRF and ERA5 precipitation data in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, the daily precipitation data with a resolution of 10km from 1951 to 2020 in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin and seven sub basins are reconstructed using random forest learning algorithm. This data has been verified by the single point of the station and performs well in terms of annual and seasonal changes. And the data has been reverse evaluated by the hydrological model, which is used to drive the VIC hydrological model to simulate the runoff change of Yajiang River basin and each sub basin, and verified by the measured runoff, MODIS and glacier cataloging data. On the basis of the original first edition, this data has considered the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation, which can better describe the precipitation characteristics in alpine regions.",

This is particularly important in orographically influenced high-mountain terrains, which are highly sensitive and prone to climate change. The Third Pole (TP) is the high-elevation area in Asia centered on the Tibetan Plateau, which is also the origin of major Asian rivers. The TP is characterized by a lack of meteorological observations and heterogeneous distribution of stations due to the complex topography and harsh environmental conditions. Existing studies on multiple precipitation evaluations in TP basins suggest that none of the estimates is accurate for all basins and under all conditions, given the large differences in magnitudes and spatiotemporal characteristics. The uncertainties in current precipitation datasets largely influence the quantitative assessment of the impacts of glacier and snowmelt water on streamflow. Given the large uncertainties of widely used precipitation estimates in hydrological simulation in the TP, bias corrections for gridded precipitation estimates are needed before they are used as inputs for hydrological modeling."
