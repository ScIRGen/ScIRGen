                    "Answer": "In the context of meteorological data collection and estimation methods, '光合有效辐射' refers to Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), which is the range of light wavelengths that plants use for photosynthesis. The estimation of PAR in this domain is based on a model that considers various atmospheric processes such as aerosol absorption and scattering, water vapor absorption, ozone absorption, and Rayleigh scattering under clear sky conditions. Additionally, sunshine duration is used as an indicator to parameterize the impact of clouds on surface PAR, allowing for the estimation of PAR under all-sky conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The parameterization of atmospheric broadband transmittance for PAR in clear sky conditions involves considering four attenuation processes: aerosol absorption and scattering, water vapor absorption, ozone absorption, and Rayleigh scattering. By using sunshine duration as an indicator of cloud impact on radiation, it is possible to estimate surface PAR under all-sky conditions. The model's accuracy is demonstrated by a root mean square error of less than 14W/m², indicating that the approach effectively accounts for both clear and cloudy conditions when estimating surface PAR.",

                    "Answer": "Estimation errors in datasets measuring photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can be caused by inaccuracies in the parameterization of the atmospheric broadband transmittance model. Factors such as aerosols' absorption and scattering, water vapor absorption, ozone absorption, and Rayleigh scattering must be accurately modeled. Additionally, the method of using sunshine duration to assess cloud impact on PAR might introduce errors if the relationship between sunshine duration and PAR is not perfectly parameterized or if local atmospheric conditions vary significantly from the model assumptions.",

Sunshine duration is utilized as an indicator to parameterize the effect of clouds on surface PAR, enabling estimation under all-sky conditions. The model's accuracy is validated with a root mean square error of less than 14W/m².",
