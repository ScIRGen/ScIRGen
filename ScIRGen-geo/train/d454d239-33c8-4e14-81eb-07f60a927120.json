Because of its topographic character, the plateau surface absorbs a large amount of solar radiation energy, and undergoes dramatic seasonal changes of surface heat and water fluxes. Remote sensing from satellites however offers the possibility to derive regional distribution of surface heat fluxes over heterogeneous land surface of the Tibetan Plateau in combination with sparse field experimental stations. Regional distributions of surface heat flux (net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux) have already been gotten by some researchers over the Tibetan Plateau area, but the results were only in meso-scale area till now."

To reach more accurate regional land surface heat fluxes over the Tibetan Plateau area, more field observations, more accurate radiation transfer models to determine the surface reflectance and surface temperature, and another satellites such as GMS (Geo-stationary Meteorological Satellite), ATSR (Along Track Scanning Radiometer) and AVHRR (Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer) have to be used."
