            "description": "In order to explore how and when turnip was successfully domesticated the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and what is the relationship between turnip domestication and early human settlement on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and human migration along the ancient Silk Road, the whole genome De Novo sequencing of a self-bred F1 variety on Qinghai-Xizang Plateau was conducted, with the assembled genome size of 409.69 Mb,Contig N50 was 1.21 Mb in June 2018 using Pacbio sequencing. Those data will provide a genetic basis for elucidating the relationship between plant disperse and human activities. As we know, traditional turnip landrace is influenced by human domestication and nature selection. Hopefully, the study will help to understand the impacts of human selection on turnip genetic differentiation, and the adaptation mechanism of turnip in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.",
