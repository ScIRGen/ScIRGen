            "description": "We present 11 years of such data for a relict permafrost site at Mahan Mountain on the northeast of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The meteorological data are comprised of air temperature, air relative humidity, wind speed and direction, shortwave and longwave downwards and upwards radiation, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and ground surface temperature on half-an-hour timescale. The active layer data include daily time series of soil temperature and soil moisture at five levels. The permafrost data consist of ground temperature at twenty depths. The released high-quality and long-term datasets are expected to serve as accurate forcing data and validate and assess remote-sensing products and land surface models for a broader geoscientific community.",

                "Permafrost is defined as ground that remains at or below 0 °C for at least 2 consecutive years (Van Everdingen, 1998). As a major component of the cryosphere, the area underlain by permafrost ranges from 12.21 ×10^6 to 16.98 ×10^6 km^2, or from 12.8 % to 17.8 % of the terrestrial landscape in the Northern Hemisphere (Zhang et al., 2000). The thermal state of permafrost is sensitive to climatic warming. There is increasing evidence indicating that permafrost is warming at both global and regional scales (Harris et al., 2003; Cheng and Wu, 2007; Romanovsky et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010; Hjort et al., 2018; Biskaborn et al., 2019). Generally, the evidence of permafrost degradation includes rising mean annual ground temperature, deepening active layer thickness, talik and thermokarst development, and decreasing permafrost extent (Cheng and Wu, 2007). Permafrost degradation affects local hydrology, ecosystems, infrastructure stability, and even feedbacks to the climate system (Nauta et al., 2015; Walvoord and Kurylyk, 2016; Hjort et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Shogren et al., 2022). Relict permafrost is usually characterized by high-temperature sporadic permafrost, where the mean annual ground temperature of permafrost is close to 0 °C. The relict permafrost presents a favorable opportunity to compare the impacts of climatic warming on the permafrost and the seasonal frozen ground, as they have similar climate conditions (Mu et al., 2017). In addition, the different impacts of vegetation, terrain, and organic matter on the ground thermal regime could be determined in the relict permafrost regions (Xie et al., 2013). Long-term and continuous observations of meteorological variables, active layer, and permafrost are of great importance to understanding the impacts of climatic changes on the ground thermal regime (Boike et al., 2019). It is critical to better understand the energy balance at the ground surface to enhance our understanding of the heat and moisture exchanges within the active layer and the permafrost layer. Furthermore, the data on atmospheric conditions and hydrothermal regimes of the active layer are also of great significance for validating remote sensing datasets and land surface models in cold regions (Westermann et al., 2011; Park et al., 2016, 2018; Che et al., 2019; L. Zhao et al., 2021)."

The permafrost borehole suffered water penetration from 2012 to 2016, which caused low-quality permafrost temperature data."

                "We present 11 years of meteorological and soil data from the Mahan Mountain relict permafrost site of northeastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. The meteorological data comprise air and land surface temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, shortwave and longwave downwards and upwards radiation, water vapor pressure, and precipitation on a half-hour timescale. The active layer data include daily soil temperature and soil volumetric water content at five different depths. The permafrost data consist of the ground temperature at 20 different depths up to 28.4 m. The meteorological station of the Mahan Mountain continues to observe a variety of meteorological variables from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2020. All meteorological variables are monitored in 30 min intervals. For the active layer soil temperature and soil water content observations, there were several blank gaps from 2012 to 2014 owing to a broken storage battery. Subsequently, we solved these problems by installing a new storage battery with a larger capacity. Moreover, the permafrost borehole suffered water penetration from 2012 to 2016, which caused low-quality permafrost temperature data; we repaired it and manually measured the permafrost temperature at different depths since 2017. The underground soil temperature and soil volumetric water content data in the active layer were monitored at five depths (10, 30, 80, 100, and 120 cm). In August 2008, a borehole with a depth of 28.5 m was drilled to monitor the permafrost temperature. In mid-December 2008, 20 thermistors were installed at different depths in the borehole (0.1, 0.4, 0.9, 1.4, 1.9, 2.4, 3.4, 6.4, 7.4, 9.4, 11.4, 13.4, 15.4, 17.4, 19.4, 21.4, 23.4, 25.4, 27.4, and 28.4 m). From May 2009, permafrost temperature data for each half-hour were automatically recorded by the datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, USA). Since 2017, a digital multimeter has been used to manually measure the permafrost temperature at 13 layers (3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25 m) for 2–4 times each month."
