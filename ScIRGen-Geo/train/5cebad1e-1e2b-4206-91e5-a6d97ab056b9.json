                "Oasis is a unique ecological landscape formed under extremely arid climatic conditions on a large-scale desert background, and it is the main place for human survival and development in arid and semi-arid regions. Desertification has become an important factor restricting the ecological stability of oases and the coordinated development of humans and nature. Minqin Oasis is located on the wind-sand line in northwest China, and for a long time, due to the combined effects of natural and human factors, the ecological function of the oasis has weakened, the ecological environment has continued to deteriorate as a whole, desertification has continued to expand, and ecological problems are prominent. Historically, Minqin Oasis was fertile and rich, known as the \"Oasis of the Frontier\", but with the increase in population and the overdevelopment of resources, it gradually evolved into the current desert oasis ecosystem. In the 1950s, large-scale water conservancy projects such as reservoirs, irrigation channels, and wells were implemented in Minqin County, which intensified the development of water resources, along with the policy of \"grain as the key link\", oasis agriculture developed unprecedentedly. However, the continuous expansion of water resource utilization has caused the water consumption in the upper and middle reaches of the Shiyang River to increase year by year, and the water volume in the downstream oasis has sharply decreased. Since the 1980s, in order to develop the economy, large-scale deforestation and land reclamation, well excavation, and farmland irrigation have led to a series of serious ecosystem problems such as groundwater level decline, oasis shrinkage, and land desertification. Minqin Oasis is an important ecological security barrier to prevent the merging of the Badain Jaran Desert and the Tengger Desert. Oasis desertification not only affects agricultural and pastoral production and restricts the sustainable economic development of the region but also threatens people's living and survival environment, which is of long-term importance to national development and ethnic survival, attracting great attention from the Party and the state."

Desertification tended to develop toward the northeastern oasis and the Badain Jaran Desert; from 2000 to 2018, the center of gravity of slight aeolian desertification moved to the northwest. The center of gravity of moderate, severe, and extremely severe aeolian desertification land is relatively stable, and the development of oasis aeolian desertification land is obviously controlled. In the process of oasis aeolian desertification, the contribution rate of human factors is 39.53%, the combined contribution rate of natural and human factors is 26.58%, and the contribution rate of natural factors is 10.77%. Human factors are the main driving force for the desertification of Minqin Oasis. The extreme scarcity of water resources is a decisive factor in the aeolian desertification of oasis. In the future sand prevention and control work, combining human driving factors, rationally regulating human production and operation activities, and optimizing the allocation of water resources in arid areas, the aeolian desertification of Minqin Oasis can be controlled from the source."

                "AnswerEn": "The analysis of temporal and spatial changes in the Minqin Oasis desertification reveals that from 1975 to 2018, severe desertification was predominant. The overall trend showed a decrease in areas of slight, moderate, severe, and extremely severe desertification. From 1975 to 2000, the center of gravity for slight, moderate, and severe desertification shifted northeast, while extremely severe desertification moved west. After 2000, the center of gravity for slight desertification shifted northwest, with moderate, severe, and extremely severe desertification remaining stable, indicating controlled desertification development.",
