It features three independent observation cameras used for nadir, forward, and backward viewing to obtain stereo images. The dataset includes images with a nadir spatial resolution of 2.5 meters and is utilized for stereo mapping by acquiring stereoscopic imagery along the satellite's orbit.",

This approach likely aims to capture seasonal or event-specific changes, and the use of the ALOS PRISM sensor with its high spatial resolution and stereo mapping capability supports this targeted data collection strategy.",

In the case of the Heihe River Basin, the PRISM sensor provides a spatial resolution of 2.5m, which can improve the precision of geographical and topographical mapping. The independent cameras for nadir, forward, and backward observations allow for comprehensive stereo imaging, contributing to more accurate elevation models and surface analysis.",

The spatial resolution at nadir is 2.5 meters. The data undergoes radiometric and geometric corrections to reach LB2 product level. The collection process involves acquiring images from specific locations, such as the Heihe River basin, at designated times, with images from areas like Arou, Haichaoba, and Bianzhukou captured in March and April 2008.
