            "description": "This data set mainly includes Cu isotopic analysis of orogenic peridotites from the everea Alps, Italy, in balmucha and baltisa. Cu isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation of whole rock samples. The whole rock sample was crushed to less than 200 mesh without pollution, and the powder was digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin. Then the copper isotope was tested by MC-ICPMS. The international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. The data quality has reached the international first-class level. The results provide important information for the Cu isotopic composition of peridotite reservoirs.",
