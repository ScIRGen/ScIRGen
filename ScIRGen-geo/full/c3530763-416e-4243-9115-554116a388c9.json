            "description": "The extreme drought damage historical events data of the 34 key areas along One Belt One Road were collected from Internet. First, a Web crawler was coded by python language. Using several key words about extreme drought damage, web pages were then collected by Google and Baidu search engine. Last, important information about the extreme drought  events (e.g., place, time, affected area, affected population, count of death) were extracted from web pages. This data can be used for risk assessment of extreme drought in the 34 key areas along One Belt One Road.",

However, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data depend heavily on the quality and reliability of the web pages from which the data is extracted. This method allows for a broad collection of data from various sources, but it may also introduce inconsistencies due to varying reporting standards and potential biases in online content. These factors can affect the risk assessment of extreme drought events along the 'Belt and Road' Initiative's key nodes and regions.",

This process involves writing a program in Python to automate the data retrieval. The web crawler accesses Google and Baidu search engines and uses specific keywords related to extreme drought events to gather web page information. The collected data is then parsed to extract core information such as the time, location, event overview, impact range, number of affected people, number of deaths, and web page addresses. This approach enables the compilation of a comprehensive dataset for risk assessment of extreme droughts in these regions.",
