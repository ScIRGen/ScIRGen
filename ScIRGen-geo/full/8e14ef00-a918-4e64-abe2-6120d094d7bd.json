Based on the established observation system in the Heihe River Basin and the results of the \"Heihe Comprehensive Remote Sensing Joint Experiment\" conducted from 2007 to 2009, researchers from multiple disciplines, institutions, and projects will conduct a multi-scale comprehensive observation experiment in the Heihe River Basin from 2012 to 2015, utilizing a combination of satellite and aerial remote sensing as well as ground observations. Basin science is the practice of Earth system science at the basin scale. This aligns with the international trend in basin science research, focusing on the forefront of comprehensive Earth system science research while also addressing significant national strategic needs in environmental construction and integrated management of river basins in western China. Developing basin observation systems and conducting comprehensive observation experiments are also important prerequisites for advancing basin science. Establishing an integrated remote sensing-ground observation system at the basin level is a significant trend in current Earth surface system scientific research. From 2007 to 2009, with the support of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Western Action Plan Phase II project \"Synchronous Remote Sensing-Ground Observation Experiment and Comprehensive Simulation Platform Construction in the Heihe River Basin,\" we collaborated with the National Key Basic Research Development Program project \"Theory and Methods for Coordinated Inversion of Surface Ecological Environment Factors Using Active and Passive Remote Sensing\" to carry out the \"Heihe Comprehensive Remote Sensing Joint Experiment.\" The successful completion of this experiment has provided a solid scientific foundation and accumulated valuable experience for conducting a new round of experimental research based on it."

Specific objectives in basic observation include: establishing a watershed observation system that supports watershed scientific research and comprehensive water resource management; finely observing various components of the watershed water cycle to obtain multi-scale observational data; and acquiring multi-scale observational data to understand the dynamic changes of inland river basin ecosystems. In terms of remote sensing products and validation, the objectives include: based on comprehensive experiments, producing a set of high-precision remote sensing products that support integrated watershed-ecological-hydrological research; and conducting validation experiments to verify remote sensing models and products. The application objectives are to use comprehensive observational data and remote sensing products in upstream cold region distributed hydrological models, midstream surface water-groundwater-crop growth coupling models, and downstream ecological water consumption models, thereby enhancing the application capabilities of remote sensing in integrated watershed ecological-hydrological research and water resource management through empirical studies."

At the watershed scale, surface heterogeneity is more pronounced, and the diversity of landscape types in inland river basins leads to significant variations in many parameters of water cycles and ecological processes. This necessitates remote sensing products with higher spatial and temporal resolution, as well as relatively consistent spatiotemporal resolution. However, many existing global remote sensing products do not meet this demand. There is also a lack of mature methodologies for applying remote sensing to eco-hydrological models. There is considerable debate regarding the extent to which remote sensing can enhance our understanding of eco-hydrological processes and its overall usefulness."
