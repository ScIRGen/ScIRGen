            "description": "This data is the whole rock trace element, rare earth element, zircon U-Pb age, trace element and Hf isotope data of Jiangshan gold deposit in Bengbu uplift, Northern Anhui Province. The whole rock trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS, and the zircon U-Pb age, trace element and Hf isotope data were obtained by la-icp-ms. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the obtained data and previous work, we can clarify the diagenetic and metallogenic epoch, tectonic setting, magma source area and magma evolution process of the deposit, and discuss the relationship between magma and mineralization, so as to enrich the prospecting prospect of Bengbu uplift gold deposit.",
