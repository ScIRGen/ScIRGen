            "description": "The SMC dataset contains land soil moisture data for Chinese land spanning from 2002 to 2018, the unit is m3/m3, in monthly temporal and 0.05° spatial resolution. More specifically, it is produced by from three passive microwave remote sensing products: the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)’s Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) Level 3 soil moisture data, and SMOS product that was developed by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) (INRA) and Centre d’Etudes Spatiales de la BIOsphère (CESBIO) soil moisture data. To overcome the deficiencies of passive microwave soil moisture products with low resolution, we construct a spatially weighted decomposition (SWD) using TVDI that calculated by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, including the land surface temperature (LST) MYD11C3 data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) MYD13C2 data. Overall, the downscaled soil moisture (SM) products were consistent with the in-situ measurements (R>0.78) and exhibited a low root mean square error (ubRMSE < 0.05 m3/m3), which indicates good accuracy throughout the time series. The dataset can be widely used to significantly improve hydrologic and drought monitoring and can serve as an important input for ecological and other geophysical models.",

The approach addresses the low spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products by utilizing MODIS data for better spatial resolution. As a result, the downscaled soil moisture products show strong agreement with field measurements (R > 0.78) and maintain low root mean square errors (ubRMSE < 0.05 m³/m³), indicating good accuracy throughout the time series. This enhances the dataset's utility for applications in hydrology and drought monitoring, as well as its role as a critical input for ecological and geophysical models.",

                    "Answer": "The goal of combining multiple passive microwave remote sensing products is to create a comprehensive soil moisture dataset that covers a specific region over an extended period, from 2002 to 2018. This approach leverages data from various sources, including Japan's JAXA AMSR-E and AMSR2 Level 3 soil moisture data, and France's SMOS soil moisture data, to address the low spatial resolution challenge inherent in passive microwave soil moisture products. By utilizing the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) and developing a spatial weight decomposition (SWD) model, researchers aim to enhance the spatial resolution of the soil moisture dataset. Ultimately, this approach seeks to ensure the dataset's accuracy and consistency with field measurements, evidenced by a high correlation (R > 0.78) and low unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE < 0.05 m³/m³).
