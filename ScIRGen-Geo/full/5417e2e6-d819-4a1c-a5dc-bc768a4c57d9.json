        "Interception loss can be considered as a quantity, defined as the rainfall intercepted by a surface and subsequently evaporated back to the atmosphere. Previous studies have found that the magnitude of interception loss of vegetation is in the range of 8–40% of annual gross rainfall according to field observations. Consequently, models ignoring interception loss of vegetation may underestimate ET from vegetated land. Until now, many studies on the interception loss have focused on field scale. These methods or achievements cannot be used directly at basin scales, since land surface is often characterized as heterogeneous and the spatial distribution of vegetation is complex at this scale."

        "Since the localized SV values for different vegetation types are not always available, we used the values of SV from the previous studies which may be different from those in the study area. The existence of mixing pixel is an unavoidable uncertainty sources for estimating the interception loss using remote sensing observations. An alternative method is to use high spatial resolution images to reduce the pixel-mixing effects."

        "We used a modified Gash analytical model by combining remote sensing observations to estimate the interception loss of several vegetation types, e.g., grass, crop, forest and shrub for the years 2003–2012 in the Heihe River Basin. The estimated monthly interception ratio (in percent) was compared with field measurements made in Dayekou and Pailugou forest hydrology experimental sites and the results showed reasonable accuracy with RMSE of 5.0% and 4.3% at the two sites, respectively."

The gap-free Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data set with 0.01◦ in spatial and 8-day in temporal resolution are reconstructed from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products of NDVI (MOD13A2) and LAI (MOD15A2). The products of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 Version 7 (V7), with a temporal resolution of 3-hour and a spatial resolution of 0.25◦ were used as precipitation data. The interception loss was measured at two forest experimental sites in Heihe River Basin from June to September in 2008. An Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion image with a resolution of 30 m on June 15, 2008 was used to calculate the fraction of forest in the MODIS pixel covering the experimental site for validation study."
