            "description": "The data set includes estimated data on the SOS (start of season) and the EOS (end of season) of vegetation in Sanjiangyuan based on the MODIS 16-day synthetic NDVI product (MOD13A2 collection 6). Two common phenological estimation methods were adopted: the threshold extraction method based on polynomial fitting (the term “poly” was included in the file names) and the inflection point extraction method based on double logistic function fitting (the term “sig” was included in the file names). These data can be used to analyse the relationship between vegetation phenology and climate change. The temporal coverage ranges from 2001 to 2014, and the spatial resolution is 1 km.",
