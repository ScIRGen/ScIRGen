            "description": "The original data source of the data sets:  (1) the China Meteorological Administration (cma) and the Japan meteorological agency issued a typhoon shanzhu best route data (September 7, 2018, 11 to 20 September 17, 2018).(2) Global Satellite rainfall atlas (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) land hourly rainfall lattice data released on September 7, 2018, 11 to 20 September 17, 2018).(3) the direct loss of typhoon. Data processing method is: extracting the original data and building the input file to input to the complex network - binary network model, through the model to generate the binary network structure. Then according to the result of model calculation, draw atlas of damage assessment on the Arc - GIS software. Data quality is good, relevant results have been published in SCI journals.(Niu, Yilong, et al. \"the Network Modeling and the Dynamic Mechanisms of Multi - Hazards - A Case Study of Typhoon Mangkhut.\" Water 12. 8 (2020) : 2198.
