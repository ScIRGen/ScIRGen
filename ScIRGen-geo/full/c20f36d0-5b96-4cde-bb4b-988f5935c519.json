            "description": "Temperature-humidity index (THI) was adopted to evalulate the climate suitability  for the Green Silk Road. The relative humidity isone of  the basic parameters to calculate THI. Refering to theTHI model of Tanget al. (2008), the multi-year average of  relative humidity is calculted based on the observation data (1981-2017) of weather stations provided by National Meteorological Information Center.  The multi-year average values were interpolated into the raster dataset at the resolution of 11km×1km by Kriging method based on GIS software. The climate suitability evaluation results calculated based on this dataset could highlight regional differences.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of creating spatial datasets for climate suitability evaluation, '克里格方法' (Kriging) refers to a geostatistical interpolation method used to predict and create a continuous surface from discrete data points, such as meteorological station observations. It allows for the creation of high-resolution raster datasets, such as the 1km×1km grid mentioned, by estimating values in unsampled locations based on spatial autocorrelation among observed data points.",

                    "Answer": "The Kriging interpolation technique is employed to generate a 1km×1km raster dataset of long-term average relative humidity for Silk Road countries. This method effectively highlights regional differences in climate suitability evaluations. Its comparison with other interpolation methods would revolve around its ability to maintain high spatial resolution and accurately represent regional climate variations.",
