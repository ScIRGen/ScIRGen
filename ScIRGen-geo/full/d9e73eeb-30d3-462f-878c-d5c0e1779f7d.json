            "description": "This dataset contains data on river water level and flow velocity at No.3 in the intensive runoff observation in the middle reaches of Heihe River runoff from July 28, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The observation point is located at Heihe Bridge, Lan-Xin Railway, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The riverbed is gravel and the section is stable. The latitude and longitude of the observation point is N39°2'33.08\", E100°25'49.42\",  the altitude is 1443 meters, and the river channel width is 50 meters. The water level observation is measured by SR50 ultrasonic range finder with a frequency of 60 minutes. The flow profile observation is conducted by StreamPro micro ADCP. The data declaration includes the following two parts:\nWater level observation, the observation frequency is 60 minutes, unit (cm); data covering time period from July 28, 2014 to December 31, 2014; Flow observation, unit (m3); monitoring flow and obtaining water level flow curve according to different water levels. The process of the runoff changing is obtained by observing the water level process. The missing data is uniformly represented by the string -6999.\nFor hydrometeorological network or site information, please refer to Li et al. (2013). For observation data processing, please refer to He et al. (2016).",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
