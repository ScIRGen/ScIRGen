            "description": "Pine Island Glacier, Swett Glacier, etc. are distributed in the basins of the Antarctic Ice Sheet 21 and 22, which is one of the areas with the most severe melting in the Southwest Antarctica. This dataset first uses Cryosat-2 data (August 2010 to October 2018) to establish a plane equation in each regular grid, taking into account terrain items, seasonal fluctuations, backscattering coefficients, wave front width, lifting rails and other factors, and calculates the elevation change of ice cover surface in the grid through least square regression. In addition, we used ICESat-2 data (October 2018 to December 2020) to calculate the surface elevation change during the two periods by obtaining the elevation difference at the intersection of satellite lifting orbits in each regular grid. The spatial resolution of surface elevation change data in two periods is 5km × 5km, the file format is GeoTIFF, the projection coordinate is polar stereo projection (EPSG 3031), and it is named by the name of the satellite altimetry data used. The data can be opened using ArcMap, QGIS and other software. The results show that the average elevation change rate of the region from 2010 to 2018 is -0.34 ± 0.08m/yr, which belongs to the area with severe melting. The annual average elevation change rate from October 2018 to November 2020 is -0.38 ± 0.06m/yr, which is in an intensified state compared with CryoSat-2 calculation results.",
            "instructions": "The dataset is named by the satellite altimetry data name. It contains two grid files. The spatial resolution of grid file is 5km × 5km, the projection coordinate is polar stereo projection (EPSG 3031). For CryoSat-2 radar altimeter data, in each regular grid, a plane equation is established considering terrain term, seasonal fluctuation, backscattering coefficient, wave front width, lifting rails and other factors, and the change of ice cover surface elevation in the grid is calculated by least square regression. For ICESat-2 data, the elevation difference at the intersection of satellite ascending and descending orbits in two periods is obtained in each regular grid, and then the surface elevation change of the ice sheet in this period is calculated.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using Cryosat-2 involves capturing surface elevation changes from August 2010 to October 2018 by establishing plane equations in each grid considering factors like topography, seasonal fluctuations, backscatter coefficient, waveform leading edge width, and ascending and descending tracks. In contrast, ICESat-2 captures data from October 2018 to December 2020 by obtaining elevation differences at satellite orbit cross points in each grid. Both methods focus on surface elevation changes with a spatial resolution of 5km×5km, but the temporal resolution differs, with Cryosat-2 covering a longer period than ICESat-2. The average elevation change rate from 2010-2018 is -0.34±0.08m/yr, while from October 2018 to November 2020, it is -0.38±0.06m/yr, indicating an accelerated melting trend during the latter period.",

                    "Answer": "The observed elevation change rates in the Antarctic key basins from 2010 to 2020 indicate significant melting activity, particularly in basins containing Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier. This suggests that data collection methods need to account for rapid changes in ice elevation, possibly requiring high temporal resolution and advanced interpolation techniques to accurately measure elevation changes. The use of CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2 data, with their respective methods of calculating elevation differences, highlights the need for integrating different satellite altimetry data to improve accuracy and reliability. The fact that the melting rate appears to have increased between the two periods suggests that future methodologies may need to focus on more frequent data collection and improved modeling of seasonal and topographical variances to better predict and understand ongoing changes in ice dynamics.",

The data collection methods utilize satellite altimetry data from CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2, which consider aspects such as terrain, seasonal fluctuations, backscatter coefficient, waveform front width, and ascending and descending satellite tracks. These factors help in calculating the surface elevation change within a grid. The melting rate, reflected in the average elevation change rates for the periods 2010-2018 and 2018-2020, indicates that the region is undergoing accelerated melting.",

This measurement helps in understanding the rate of ice sheet melting and its contribution to sea level rise. By establishing a detailed record of elevation changes over time, researchers can assess the dynamics of ice loss and gain insights into the factors driving these changes, contributing to better predictive models of future ice sheet behavior and global sea level impacts.",

                    "Answer": "To calculate surface elevation changes using satellite altimetry data in Antarctic regions, a process involves using Cryosat-2 data from August 2010 to October 2018. In each grid cell, a plane equation is established, considering factors such as terrain, seasonal fluctuations, backward scattering coefficients, waveform front width, and ascending/descending orbits. This is followed by least squares regression to compute the elevation changes within the grid. Additionally, ICESat-2 data from October 2018 to December 2020 is utilized by obtaining elevation differences at crossover points of satellite ascending and descending tracks within each grid cell, which helps in calculating the surface elevation changes during that period.",
