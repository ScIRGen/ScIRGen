            "description": "The 1km resolution wind energy resource data of Qinghai Tibet Plateau is developed by using the wind energy resource numerical simulation assessment system of China Meteorological Administration (weras / CMA), which includes typical terrain classification module, mesoscale model WRF and Calmet dynamic diagnosis model. Firstly, the typical days are randomly selected from the historical weather types for hourly wind speed simulation, and then the climate average distribution of wind energy resources is obtained according to the statistical analysis of the frequency of weather types. The data set includes wind speed and wind power density over the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The data accuracy of wind speed is 0.01m/s, the data accuracy of wind power density is 0.01w/m2, and the vertical height of data is 100m. The data have been checked and corrected by the observation data of meteorological stations, and are mainly used for detailed investigation of wind energy resources and macro site selection of wind farms. This data is the output data of the national wind energy resources detailed survey and evaluation project from 2008 to 2012 (the project cost is 290 million yuan), and then becomes the basic data of wind energy resources related research. The Ministry of finance has no plan to invest in extending this data set in the near future.",

                    "Answer": "The development of data collection methods using typical weather type sampling was driven by the need to accurately simulate wind speeds for wind energy resource assessment. This approach allows for hourly simulations by selecting typical days from historical weather types, which are then statistically analyzed to determine the climatic average distribution of wind energy resources. This methodology is part of the WERAS/CMA system, which integrates mesoscale models and dynamical diagnostic models, ensuring high precision in wind speed and power density data critical for detailed wind energy resource investigation and macro siting of wind farms.",

                    "Answer": "If data collection methods rely solely on mesoscale models like WRF and CALMET without incorporating additional observational data, the assessment of wind energy resources may lack accuracy and reliability. This is because models alone may not capture the full complexity of local wind patterns and variations. The absence of observational data for validation and correction could lead to biases in the simulated wind speeds and power densities, potentially impacting the precision of macro-level wind farm siting and resource evaluation.",

This dataset includes wind speed and wind power density data at a vertical height of 100 meters and has undergone validation and correction using meteorological station observations. It serves as a foundational dataset for wind energy resource research and was produced as part of a large-scale national project for wind energy resource survey and evaluation from 2008 to 2012.",
