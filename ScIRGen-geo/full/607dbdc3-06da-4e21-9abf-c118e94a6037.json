            "description": "The dataset is the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) products of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the SAVI equation which is added soil adjusted parameters S based on NDVI equation.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.SAVI is stable in the sparse vegetation area, but is not sensitive in the dense vegetation area .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the SAVI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the SAVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SAVI;the SAVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "The Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) is a product derived from Landsat satellite surface reflectance data, specifically calculated by introducing a soil adjustment factor into the NDVI calculation formula. This modification aims to enhance the stability of vegetation indices in areas with sparse vegetation and reduce sensitivity in areas with dense vegetation coverage. In this context, SAVI is part of a dataset for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2021, where cloud and snow are marked for quality assurance.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for generating the Landsat series SAVI product rely on satellite remote sensing, specifically using surface reflectance data from the Landsat series satellites, and apply the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) formula. This approach allows for large-scale, long-term monitoring of vegetation indices, offering efficiency and coverage advantages over traditional survey techniques, which typically involve ground-based observations that may provide higher accuracy but are labor-intensive and cover smaller areas. Additionally, the SAVI product incorporates a soil adjustment factor to stabilize the index in sparsely vegetated regions, which may not be addressed in conventional surveys.",

In contrast, it is less sensitive in areas with dense vegetation coverage, where the soil factor has less impact.",
