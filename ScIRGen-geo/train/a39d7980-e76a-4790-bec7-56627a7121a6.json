            "description": "This data set contains zircon U-Pb dating, zircon Hf isotope, whole-rock principal, and trace element data of diorite granite and andesite dacite in Xinjiang area, south of bango, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The data results are from the Zhai Qingguo research team, Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The data are of good quality and can be used to study the ocean closure process of Bangong Lake Nujiang suture in the central Qinghai Tibet Plateau, the subsequent collision process of Lhasa Qiangtang block, magmatism, and the Cretaceous crustal regeneration and reconstruction of Lhasa block in the central and Northern Qinghai Tibet Plateau. At the same time, this data also provides zircon CL images and reflection photos of all samples, zircon location for reference and comparison, and also provides a basis for the chronology of magmatic rocks and zircon genesis in the study area at the same time.\nZircon U-Pb age instrument: obtained from laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), zircon Hf isotope instrument: Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC – ICP – MS), connected by a goals-193 laser ablation system. The main and trace elements of the whole rock are measured by the National Experimental Center (Academy of Geosciences), Major elements: (XRF; Axios – pw4400), trace elements: ICP-MS; PerkinElmer NexION 300D。",
            "instructions": "The geochemical data file name is LITHOS data, which is an. Xlsx file. The file contains three sheets. U-Pb age data is the result of zircon U-Pb data, Hf isotope is the Hf isotope of zircon, and whole rocks is the result of major and trace elements of the whole rock. Zircon CL images and reflection and transmission images include all 6 samples. All original images are spliced into the whole sample and named as sampling year + place + sample number. For example, the Tibetan sample in 2016 is 16t * * *. The spliced images are in TIF format. The first row is the reflection image, the second row is the CL image, and the third shot is the transmission image.",
