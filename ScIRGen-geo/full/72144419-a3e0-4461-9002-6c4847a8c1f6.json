            "description": "The No. 1 hydrological section is located at 213 Heihe River Bridge (100.345° E, 38.912° N, 1546 m) in the midstream of the Heihe River Basin, Zhangye city, Gansu Province. The dataset contains observations recorded by the No.1 hydrological section from 13 June, 2012, to 6 September, 2013. This section consists of two river sections, i.e., the east section,which is denoted as No. 1 and the west section, which is denoted as No. 2. The width of this section is 330 meters and consists of a gravel bed; the cross-sectional area is unstable because of human factors. The water level was measured using an SR50 ultrasonic range and the discharge was measured using cross-section reconnaissance by the StreamPro ADCP. The dataset includes the following parameters: water level (recorded every 30 minutes) and discharge. The missing and incorrect (outside the normal range) data were replaced with -6999.\nFor more information, please refer to Li et al. (2013) (for hydrometeorological observation network or sites information), He et al. (2016) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

In the context of the dataset, they were used to collect water level data at a frequency of 30 minutes, which is critical for understanding the flow variations and creating water level-flow curves.",

The dataset indicates that the riverbed is gravelly and the cross-sections are unstable due to frequent human interventions, leading to a chaotic water level-flow curve. Such data can help infer the extent of these disturbances and the natural variability in river flow, suggesting that further observations are needed to obtain a stable water level-flow curve.",

This instability results in unreliable flow data and necessitates further observations to ensure accuracy. The inability to obtain stable water level-flow curves may lead to the discontinuation of data collection in affected areas, as seen when monitoring was stopped due to these disruptions.",

These devices are positioned at specific observation points, with the challenge being the instability of the riverbed cross-sections due to frequent human disturbances, which results in disrupted water level-flow curves. The measurements are taken carefully to account for these instabilities, and missing data are uniformly represented by the string -6999.",
