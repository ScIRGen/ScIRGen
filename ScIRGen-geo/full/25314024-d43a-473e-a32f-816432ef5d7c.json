            "description": "In order to study the relationship between the spread of cyanine and human activities, we will resequence the cyanine varieties from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas, as well as Pakistan, India, Nepal, Germany, Japan and other places. At the same time, we will cluster the gene families, and make statistics of unique, shared genes and gene families. In addition, we will also carry out the analysis of gene family expansion and contraction, and system development Tree construction, genome-wide replication events and other analysis. The aim is to analyze the molecular basis of adaptation of traditional species of cyanine to the plateau under the dual pressures of human activities and regional climate. Therefore, this study is helpful to reveal the adaptive mechanism of cyanine to adapt to the plateau ecological environment and the influence of artificial domestication and human selection on its genetic differentiation in the process of evolution.",
