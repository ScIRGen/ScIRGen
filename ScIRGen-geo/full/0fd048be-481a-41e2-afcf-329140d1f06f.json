The 10 water net nodes contain 4cm and 10cm two-layer hydro probe II probes to observe the main variables such as soil moisture, soil temperature, conductivity and complex permittivity; the si-111 infrared temperature probe is set up at 4m height to observe the surface infrared radiation temperature of the underlying surface. The time and frequency of conventional observation is 10 minutes. In order to ensure the accurate synchronization of si-111 and remote sensing, one minute intensive observation is conducted at 00:00-04:30, 08:00-18:00 and 21:00-24:00 every day. This data set can provide spatiotemporal continuous observation data set for remote sensing estimation of key water and heat variables of heterogeneous surface, remote sensing authenticity test, ecological hydrology research, irrigation optimization management and other research.            \nFor details, please refer to \"2013 middle reaches of Heihe River waternet data document 20141231.

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
