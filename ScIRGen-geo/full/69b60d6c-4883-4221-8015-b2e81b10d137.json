            "description": "The surface PM2.5 concentration data of Tibet Plateau is named by date (YYYYMMDD). Each NC file contains one day's data, which is composed of PM2.5 concentration, longitude, latitude, and time information of the area (the corresponding variables in the data are named with PM2.5, lon, lat, time). The data inversion relies on the reanalysis data MERRA-2 released by NASA and the AOD product of Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). MERRA-2 is mainly based on NASA GMAO Earth system model version 5 (GEOS 5). The algorithm is able to assimilate all the in-situ and re- motely-sensed atmospheric data. This dataset mainly focuses on the aerosol field of MERRA-2. This is the first multi-decadal reanalysis within which meteorological and aerosol observations are jointly assimilated into a global assimilation system. MISR views Earth with cameras pointed in 9 different directions， which can help us know the amount of sunlight that is scattered in different directions under natural conditions. The main data products used in this data algorithm are MERRA-2 aerosol analysis product (M2T1NXAER) and MISR Level 3 version 4 global aerosol products (MIL3DAEN_4). Firstly, the ratio of PM2.5 to AOD in each grid was calculated by using the aerosol information provided by MERRA-2. Second, the PM2.5 concentration of the grid was calculated by multiplying the AOD of MISR by the ratio. The mean prediction error of PM2.5 concentration obtained by this method is within 20 μg/m3. The corresponding PM2.5 products can be used for the assessment of particulate pollution in the Tibet Plateau.",

Establishment of ground monitoring network is the ideal way to accurately measure ground-level PM2.5 concentration, which is exactly why thousands of ground sites have been deployed in the United States and Western Europe. However, sparse geographic coverage of the network is not dense enough for monitoring PM2.5 at spatial scales of a few kilometers and maintaining such networks are very costly. In addition, most developing nations have few or no surface PM2.5 measurements, therefore, alternative methods are highly required to monitor PM2.5. It has been proved that satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), the column-integrated aerosol extinction, is a good surrogate for PM2.5."

To validate filling AOD products, we choose the Level 1.5 AOD measurements at Beijing RADI site (not used in the BME method) as the independent dataset in the validation. The MODIS AOD data are gridded into 10 km by 10 km by using the nearest-neighbor interpolation method. First, the linear regression analysis is used to build the relationship between Terra and Aqua AODs for each grid if both are available. Second, missing Terra (Aqua) AOD is filled by using the linear-fit equation(1) with Aqua (Terra) AOD if available. Based on these quality-controlled hourly PM2.5 data, we calculate daily average PM2.5 concentrations if there are 20 hourly measurements each day. Here we use linear mixed-effects model (LME) to estimate PM2.5 concentrations from AOD products as a result of its simplicity and robustness (LME) (Lee et al., 2011). Daily mean AODs at AERONET and CARSNET stations are calculated and taken as the hard data for the BME algorithm. For pixels with satellite AODs are available, the Gaussian distribution probability soft data follows the normal distribution− μσ N(AOD , )combine 2 . In spatiotemporal geo-statistics, the spatiotemporal covariance is a function of distance in space and time (Fig. 3). For comparison, two BME AOD products are derived, i.e., BME-S AOD derived with only soft data and BME-SH AOD derived with satellite and sunphotometer AOD as soft and hard data, respectively."
