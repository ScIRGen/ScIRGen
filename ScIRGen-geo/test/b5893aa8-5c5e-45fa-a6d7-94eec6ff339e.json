            "description": "The dataset of airborne Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometers (PLMR) was acquired on 4 July, 2012, located along the riverway of Heihe River in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The aircraft took off at 10:50 am (UTC+8) from Zhangye airport and landed at 14:50 pm, with the flight time of 4 hours. The flight was performed in the altitude of about 1000 m and at the speed of about 220-250 km during the observation, corresponding to an expected ground resolution of about 300 m. \nThe PLMR instrument flown on a small aircraft operates at 1.413 GHz (L-band), with both H- and V-polarizations at incidence angles of ±7.5°, ±21.5° and ±38.5°. PLMR ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ calibrations were performed before and after each flight. The processed PLMR data include 2 DAT files (v-pol and h-pol separately) and 1 KMZ file for each flying day. The DAT file contains all the TB values together with their corresponding beam ID, incidence angle, location, time stamp (in UTC) and other flight attitude information as per headings. The KMZ file shows the gridded 1-km TB values corrected to 38.5 degrees together with flight lines. Cautions should be taken when using these data, as the RFI contaminations are often higher than expected at v-polarization.",

Before and after the flight, 'hot' and 'cold' radiation calibrations are conducted to ensure data accuracy. The data collected includes V and H polarization measurements, and electromagnetic interference is considered, with V polarization being more affected than H polarization. The data is processed into files that include TB values, scanning beam ID, incidence angle, position, and UTC time, with additional KMZ files providing 1 km grid TB value distributions at a 38.5-degree incidence angle.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method involves using an L-band airborne microwave radiometer to capture data over a river channel on July 4, 2012. The radiometer operates at a frequency of 1.4GHz, observing at zenith angles with V and H polarization information. The aircraft flew for four hours from 10:50 to 14:50 (Beijing time) at an altitude of approximately 1000 meters and a speed of 220-250 km/hr. The original data consists of microwave radiometer data and geographical KMZ location data. The microwave radiometer data includes V and H polarization files with a resolution of 300 meters, containing observed TB values, corresponding scan beam ID, incidence angle, position, time stamps (UTC), and flight attitude information. The KMZ file provides TB value distribution data at a 1-kilometer grid in the flying area with a 38.5-degree incidence angle. Radiometer calibrations were performed for 'hot' and 'cold' radiations at the start and end of the flight. Electromagnetic interference is a notable challenge, particularly affecting the V polarization TB values more strongly than the H polarization.",
