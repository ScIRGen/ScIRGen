            "description": "Based on the definition of the estuary with DEM values higher than 2500m, the basin area of the Nu and Lancang River estuaries was clarified. The results show that the monthly runoff series of the upper and lower reaches of the Nu and Lancang rivers are highly correlated, with R2 of about 0.96 for the scatter plot of the monthly runoff series between Jiayuqiao and Daojieba stations of the Nu River and R2 of more than 0.93 for the scatter plot of the monthly runoff series between Changdu and Jiuzhou stations of the Lancang River. This also reflects the runoff characteristics from the high mountain valley-type basins of the Nujiang and Lancang Rivers, i.e., the correlation between the upstream and downstream runoff is solid. Therefore, in this study, the monthly runoff history data series of the Nu and Lancang River outfalls were calculated using the runoff data series of the upper and lower national hydrological stations of the basin outfalls and combining the precipitation weight coefficients within each sub-basin.",

                "The flow regime change of rivers, especially transboundary rivers, affected by reservoir regulations is evident worldwide and has received much attention. Investigating dam-induced flow regime alterations is essential for understanding potential adverse downstream effects and facilitating dialogue around coordinated water use in transboundary basins, such as the Lancang River Basin (LRB). The spatial and temporal patterns of hydrological processes and water availability are profoundly changing at regional and global scales under the dual impacts of climate change and human activities. Climate change can affect streamflow in several ways. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that climate change has led to an increase in frequency and severity of extreme floods and droughts, which seriously threaten human life and property. On the other hand, infrastructure, such as dams and reservoirs, has significantly changed the flow regime. Reservoir construction and management obviously alter natural flow regimes intending to play a significant role in regional socioeconomic development within the river basin and considerably influence downstream ecological systems. In terms of environmental effects, dams and reservoirs substantially alter the natural hydrological regime, which leads to numerous physical and ecological impacts on freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems and their dependent species. Beyond flow alterations, dams also fragment aquatic habitats, such as blocking the movement of species and the delivery of nutrients and sediments downstream, which can severely disrupt natural riverine production systems - especially fisheries, flood-recession agriculture, and dry-season grazing. For example, Doan et al. (2020) pointed out that the sediment trapping in the Lancang cascade dams decreased the sediment budget in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta by 74.1 %, thereby causing severe riverbed incisions. Given these problems, a more comprehensive investigation of the hydrologic dynamics in LRB is required."

Thus, we aimed to reconstruct the natural flow regimes upstream and downstream of the cascade reservoirs. To address these questions within the basin, we use WSE observations derived from the state-of-the-art Sentinel-3 and SWE observations developed by a novel algorithm for fusing optical and SAR data to monitor cascade reservoir operation in the LRB."

            "challenges": [
                "Although the most recently constructed dams are equipped with sophisticated in-situ monitoring systems to obtain reservoir data such as inflow, storage, and outflow, and although reservoir operational rules are in place, obtaining long-term and consistent records is difficult due to a lack of data-sharing mechanisms and geopolitical concerns in transboundary river basins. The implementation of second approach in the LRB remains challenging, despite being promising owing to uncertainties in reservoir storage monitoring and inflow simulation. However, the availability of data is challenging. Although Landsat provides a long time series for WSE monitoring, data quality may deteriorate due to clouds and faulty sensors. Assuming a fixed value of reservoir SWE introduces uncertainties, contradicting the fact that reservoir SWE in the LRB fluctuates significantly with the season."

Then, storage changes were combined with hydrological model simulations of reservoir inflow to estimate the regulated flow regime downstream."

The wet season shortens (approximately 45 days), the flood peak flattens, and the low flow in the dry season has primarily increases. The two reservoirs attenuated 50 % of the flood peaks in the wet seasons and mitigated droughts by releasing up to 100 % of the natural flows in the dry seasons at the China–Laos border."
