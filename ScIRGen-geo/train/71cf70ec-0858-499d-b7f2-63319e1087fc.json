            "description": "These datasets fill the data gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO, they contain CSR RL06 Mascon and JPL RL06 Mascon. They take China as the study area, and the dataset includes \"Decimal_time”, \"lat”, \"lon”, \"time”, \"time_bounds”, \"TWSA_REC\" and \"Uncertainty\" 7 parameters in total. Among them, \"Decimal_time” corresponds to decimal time. There are 191 months from April 2002 to December 2019 (163 months for GRACE data, 17 months for GRACE-FO data, and 11 months for the gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO. We have not filled the missing data of individual months between GRACE or GRACE-FO data). \"lat\" corresponds to the latitude range of the data; \"lon\" corresponds to the longitude range of the data; \"time\" corresponds to the cumulative day of the data from January 1, 2002. And \"time_bounds\" corresponding to the cumulative day at the start date and end date of each month. “TWSA_REC\" represents the monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies from April 2002 to December 2019 in China; \"Uncertainty\" is the uncertainty between the data and CSR RL06 Mascon products. We use GRACE satellite data from CSR GRACE/GRACE-FO RL06 Mascon solutions (version 02), China Gauge-based Daily Precipitation Analysis (CGDPA, version 1.0) data, and CN05.1 temperature dataset. The precipitation reconstruction model was established, and the seasonal and trend terms of CSR RL06 Mascon products were considered to obtain the dataset of terrestrial water storage anomalies in China. The data quality is good as a whole, and the uncertainty of most regions in China is within 5cm. This dataset complements the nearly one-year data gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites, and provides a full time series for long-term land water storage change analysis in China. As the CSR RL06 Mascon product, the average value between 2004.0000 and 2009.999 is deducted from this dataset. Therefore, the 164-174 months (i.e., July 2017 to May 2018) of this dataset can be directly extracted as the estimation of terrestrial water storage anomalies during the gap period. The reconstruction method for the gap of JPL RL06 Mascon is consistent with that of CSR RL06 Mascon.",

                "Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is the sum of all forms of water storage over land surfaces, which plays a key role in the global and regional hydrological cycle. TWS varies on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, and exerts important effects upon the Earth’s climate system. After the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites in 2002, many studies have quantitatively estimated the TWS or groundwater storage (GWS) changes using GRACE data in global and regional basins. GRACE satellites can derive global monthly temporal gravity fields with a spatial resolution of ~300 km, which can be further used to estimate water storage changes over land when other mass change effects are removed from the gravity fields. However, the lack of in situ observations limits our knowledge of the relationship between natural climate variability, and human activity impacts upon terrestrial water systems. Water resources in basins are mainly influenced by climate changes and anthropogenic activities. Assessing changes in water storage on the global scale under the impact of climate variability and human activity has drawn great attention to the growing water scarcity around the world. On one hand, the climatic fluctuations in ocean and atmosphere, such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), resulting from the large-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions over the equatorial Pacific, can strongly affect global water storage by influencing precipitation patterns. During the warm phase of ENSO (i.e., El Niño), heavy rains generally occur in South America, while droughts occur in Southeast Asia and Australia. On the contrary, during the cold phase of ENSO (i.e., La Niña), heavy rains occur in Southeast Asia and Australia, while droughts occur in Southwestern USA and the West Coast of South America. Other climatic fluctuations, e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) also impact TWS anomalies (TWSA) at different temporal and spatial scales. On the other hand, due to the increasing water resource management and consumption all around the world, impacts of anthropogenic activities on water storage become more important, and should be taken into account in the hydrologic cycle and modeling. Impacts of direct human activities could be through water withdrawal, the building of reservoirs, or land use and land cover change. Some previous studies have focused on analyzing the relative contribution of TWSA from natural and anthropogenic effects. For instance, Yi et al. estimated an anthropogenic TWS depletion estimate of −187 ± 38 km3/yr in Asia by using a linear relationship between variations in precipitation anomalies and water storage fluxes. Huang et al. isolated the human-induced TWSA by subtracting climate-driven TWSA simulated by models from GRACE-observed TWSA. As GRACE can detect the total TWS changes affected by both climate variability and human activities, whereas land surface model (LSM) simulations generally represent the climate-related TWS changes in most cases. Felfelani et al. quantified the human-induced TWSA by calculating the difference between the two hydrological models, in which human impacts were considered in one model, but not included in the other one. However, there are some limitations and uncertainties in terms of modeling and forcing data. For example, Yi et al. assumed that the anthropogenic component is constant over time, and the climate-driven effect is zero from 1979 to 2015, and they analyzed both impacts on the annual scale. A systematic difference between various precipitation-forcing data was also highlighted. Felfelani et al. also found that the TWSA trend uncertainty caused by the errors in forcing datasets was as high as the TWSA trend differences resulting from different hydrological models. Moreover, global hydrological models and land surface models may exhibit large biases in TWSA amplitude."

We show that previous approaches (e.g., relying on land surface models) provide lower estimates of the climate-driven trend, and thus likely underestimated the human-induced trend.

TWS varies on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales and exerts important effects upon the Earth’s climate system. GRACE satellites can derive global monthly temporal gravity fields, which can be used to estimate water storage changes over land when other mass change effects are removed from the gravity fields.",
