            "description": "The full-spectrum spectral measurements were conducted over 8 land cover types, including four vegetation types (i.e., forests (larch), shrubs, grasses and crops (maize)), two soil types (i.e., ordinary soil and frozen soil), snow, and cement road. Three spectrometer types were utilized to assemble the data records, namely the reflectance measurement from visible to shortwave infrared region (solar reflectance spectra), the emissivity measurement in the thermal infrared region (thermal emission spectra), and the microwave radiation measurement in the microwave region (microwave radiation). They were measured synchronously with ASD/SVC reflectance spectrometer, 102F/BOMAN emissivity meter, and microwave radiometers (RPG/JYRS). Associated with the spectra, the parameters describing the targets’ properties such as the object type, observed time, location, the solar and sensor geometry, satellite images as well as the observed instrument and contributions of units, were simultaneously recorded as the auxiliary information to describe the spectral measurement scene. The satellite pixel spectra (i.e., 10 m sentinel-OLI reflectance and 500 m MODIS reflectance) corresponding to the measured site was also extracted. This spectra library aids particularly the development of the modeling ，can also support further research on cross-spectrum domains underlying mechanisms, i.e. the physical radiative transfer processes, and the retrieval of surface biophysical and biochemical parameters. They can serve as a reference truth for satellite observations in validation. The full-spectrum spectra provide more useful information for characterizing the spectral endmembers of remote sensing models, thus support more accurate identification and classification of surface type.",
            "instructions": "This dataset includes 11 full-spectrum data records. Each full-spectrum spectra data record was organized in a folder named as “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_XXXX”. The “AAAA” were set as “spec, respectively. The “BBBB_CCCC” means the land cover and the object name. The “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS” shows the measured time. The core files of the full-spectrum include the combination data of reflectance, emissivity, microwave bright temperature, metadata files, and the satellite data. The data file was processed as TXT format and the metadata file was set as XML format. The satellite data and the quick view image were set as Tiff and JPEG format, respectively. As for the name of each spectral data, the file name is recorded as “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_XXXX”, where the “XXXX” shows the file type, “A000” means the data file, and “B000” means the auxiliary file of XML. The “AAAA” represents the spectral types, where “refl”, “emis”, and “mwra” denote the reflectance, emissivity, and microwave emissivity, respectively. And the “pixel”, “img”, and “view” represent the satellite pixel spectral, the satellite image, and the quick-view image, respectively. Regarding the name of the metadata, “AAAA” was set as “comp” and “pixel” . “comp”refer to the scene information of the spectra，and “pixel” indicates the information of satellite pixel spectra.",

                "However, there are several limitations to the exiting libraries. First, they provide spectra in shortwave, infrared, or microwave domains separately. This discontinuity does not meet the requirements for developing a unified spectral-domain radiative transfer model and its associated applications. Second, they rarely measure (and release) anisotropic spectra across different spectral domains. Nevertheless, apparent anisotropy exists in the surface reflectivity in the VNIR-SWIR spectral domain (e.g., bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)), emissivity in the TIR spectral domain (e.g., directional bright temperature), and reflectivity or emissivity in the microwave spectral domains (e.g., directional microwave radiation). Ignoring the directionality of satellite observations may lead to large errors in the retrieval of remote sensing radiation and vegetation structure variables. Therefore, the multi-angular spectra are a pressing need to advance the estimation of surface energy budget and modeling of land surface processes. Third, there is a lack of multiscale spectra measurements (e.g., leaf and canopy spectra), which hinders the understanding of cross-scale physical radiative transfer and associated ecological processes. Hence, the collection of multiscale spectra is much needed to help improve the understanding of cross-scale radiative transfer processes from individual leaves to canopies and even ecosystems and promote the exploration of scaling effects on ecological processes (e.g., upscaling plant function traits). Furthermore, the temporal dynamic spectra for typical vegetation are insufficient. Given the fact that the vegetation dynamics are crucial for modeling land cover change and plant phenology as well as its feedback to climate change, vegetation spectra across different growth stages need to be further supplemented in order to improve the monitoring and modeling of land cover and land use change, and surface phenology in general."
