            "description": "This data set contains the data of meteorological element gradient observation system of dashman superstation in the middle reaches of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.The station is located in the farmland of daman irrigation district of zhangye city, gansu province.The longitude and latitude of the observation point are 100.3722e, 38.8555n and 1556m above sea level.The wind speed/direction, air temperature and relative humidity sensors are located at 3m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 30m and 40m respectively, with a total of 7 layers, facing due north.The barometer is installed at 2m;The tilting bucket rain gauge was installed at about 8m on the west side of the tower, with a height of 2.5m;The four-component radiometer is installed at 12m, facing due south;Two infrared thermometers are installed at 12m, facing due south and the probe facing vertically downward.Soil heat flow plate (self-calibration formal) (3 pieces) were buried in the ground 6cm in turn, 2m away from the tower body due south, two of which (Gs_2 and Gs_3) were buried between the trees, and one (Gs_1) was buried under the plants.The mean soil temperature sensor TCAV is buried 2cm and 4cm underground, facing due south and 2m away from the tower body.The soil temperature probe is buried at 0cm of the surface and 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm underground, 2m to the south of the meteorological tower.The soil water sensor is buried 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm underground, 2m to the south of the meteorological tower.The photosynthetic effective radiometer is installed at 12m with the probe facing vertically upward.Four other photosynthetically active radiometers were installed above and inside the canopy, 12m above the canopy (one probe vertically up and one probe vertically down), and 0.3m above the canopy (one probe vertically up and one probe vertically down), facing due south.\nThe observation items are: wind speed (WS_3m, WS_5m, WS_10m, WS_15m, WS_20m, WS_30m, WS_40m) (unit: m/s), wind direction (WD_3m, WD_5m, WD_10m, WD_15m, WD_20m, WD_30m, WD_40m) (unit:Air temperature and humidity (Ta_3m, Ta_5m, Ta_10m, Ta_15m, Ta_20m, Ta_30m, Ta_40m and RH_3m, RH_5m, RH_10m, RH_15m, RH_20m, RH_30m, RH_40m) (unit: Celsius, percentage), air pressure (Press) (unit: hpa), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), four-component radiation (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit:Watts/m2), surface radiant temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit: Celsius), average soil temperature (TCAV) (unit: Celsius), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watts/m2), soil moisture (Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm, Ms_10cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_40cm, Ms_80cm, Ms_120cm, Ms_160cm) (unit:Soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_40cm, Ts_80cm, Ts_120cm, Ts_160cm)Mmol/m s) and the upward and downward photosynthetic effective radiation (PAR_D_up, PAR_D_down) under the canopy (in mmol/m s).\nProcessing and quality control of observed data :(1) ensure 144 pieces of data every day (every 10min), and mark by -6999 in case of data missing;Non-soil data (wind speed, wind direction, air temperature and humidity, air pressure, precipitation, four-component radiation, surface radiation temperature and photosynthetically active radiation) were missing between June 20, 2014 and June 27, 2014 due to the data collector.The wind speed and direction of 3m were between January 17th, 2014 -- January 21st, 2014 and February 10th, 2014 -- February 2nd, 2014.5m wind speed and direction between 2014.2.10-3.2due to sensor problems, data is missing;The soil temperature was between October, 2014 and December, 2014. Due to the problem of the data collector, the data was missing.(2) excluding the time with duplicate records;(3) data that obviously exceeds the physical significance or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the part marked with red letter in the data is the data in question;(5) date and time have the same format, and date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2014-6-1010:30;(6) the naming rule is: AWS+ site name.\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Liu et al.(2018), and for observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al.(2011).",

                    "Answer": "The '气象要素梯度观测系统' (meteorological element gradient observation system) refers to a structured approach for collecting meteorological data at various heights to capture gradients in parameters like wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, and relative humidity. Sensors are strategically placed at different elevations (3m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 30m, 40m) to gather data reflecting changes at different atmospheric layers.",

                    "Answer": "The dataset describes several challenges in data collection, such as sensor malfunctions and data acquisition issues that caused missing data during specified periods. These challenges highlight the importance of implementing rigorous quality control measures, like marking missing data with specific values, removing duplicate records, and filtering out physically implausible data. The need for consistent data formatting also indicates underlying difficulties in maintaining a seamless data collection process.",

                    "Answer": "Data gaps or errors in meteorological observation systems can be caused by issues with data collectors, such as equipment malfunction or sensor problems. For example, non-soil data were missing between June 20-27, 2014, due to issues with the data collector. Additionally, specific sensor problems led to data gaps in wind speed and direction observations at 3m and 5m heights during certain periods in early 2014.",

                    "Answer": "Using placeholders like -6999 to mark missing data points can help identify gaps in the dataset, but it may also introduce challenges in data analysis and accuracy, as these placeholders need to be carefully handled during data processing to avoid skewing results. Additionally, missing data can impact the completeness of the analysis, and the reasons for data loss (e.g., sensor malfunction or data collector issues) need to be addressed to improve future data collection methods.",

                    "Answer": "In an ecological hydrological remote sensing experiment, meteorological elements such as wind speed, air temperature, and soil moisture are measured using a gradient observation system. Wind speed and direction are measured with sensors placed at multiple heights (3m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 30m, 40m) facing true north. Air temperature and relative humidity sensors are also positioned at these heights. Soil moisture and temperature sensors are buried at varying depths (0cm to 160cm) at a specified distance from the meteorological tower. The accuracy of measurements is ensured by addressing data gaps, removing duplicate records, deleting physically meaningless data, and marking questionable data clearly in red. Data is collected every 10 minutes, totaling 144 data points daily, and missing data is indicated with a placeholder value of -6999.",
