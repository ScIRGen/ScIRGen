            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Arou Superstation in the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2022. There were two types of LASs at Arou Superstation: BLS900 and RR-RSS460, produced by Germany and China, respectively. The north tower was set up with the RR-RSS460 receiver and the BLS900 transmitter, and the south tower was equipped with the RR-RSS460 transmitter and the BLS900 receiver. The site (north: 100.471° E, 38.057° N; south: 100.457° E, 38.038° N) was located in Caodaban village of A’rou town in Qilian county, Qinghai Province. The underlying surface between the two towers was alpine meadow. The elevation is 3033 m. The effective height of the LASs was 13.0 m, and the path length was 2390 m. The data were sampled 1 minute at both BLS900 and RR-RSS460.\nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 exceeded the saturated criterion (BLS900: Cn2>7.25E-14, RR-RSS460: Cn2>7.84E-14). (2) The data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS900: Average X Intensity<1000; RR-RSS460: Demod>-20mv). (3) The data were rejected when collected during precipitation. (4) The data were rejected if collected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). In the iteration process, the universal functions of Thiermann and Grassl (1992) and Andreas (1988) were selected for BLS900 and RR-RSS460, respectively. Detailed can refer to Liu et al. (2011, 2013). Due to instrument adjustment and inadequate power supply, the date of missing data for the large aperture scintillator is: 2022.10.24-2022.12.18.\nSeveral instructions were included with the released data. (1) The data were primarily obtained from BLS900 measurements, and missing flux measurements from the BLS900 instrument were substituted with measurements from the RR-RSS460 instrument. The missing data were denoted by -6999. Due to the problems of storing and wireless transmission. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: Date/time (yyyy/m/d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xlsx format. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "A Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) is an instrument used to measure fluxes such as sensible heat flux over large distances by analyzing the scintillation of light as it passes through the atmosphere. It is used in surface process observation networks to observe and quantify atmospheric parameters like the refractive index structure parameter (Cn2) and sensible heat flux (H). The data collected is processed through quality control measures and calculations based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory to ensure accuracy and reliability.",

Additionally, environmental conditions like precipitation or weak turbulent conditions and the stability of the observation site can also contribute to data loss.",

                    "Answer": "Implementing quality control steps such as removing saturated Cn2 data and weak demodulation signal data can enhance the data integrity and accuracy by ensuring that only reliable and high-quality data are used for analysis. This may lead to more accurate calculations of sensible heat flux, as unreliable data points that could introduce errors are excluded. However, it may also result in data gaps, which could affect the completeness of the dataset. In cases where both primary and secondary instruments fail to provide data, marked gaps might limit comprehensive analysis unless alternative interpolation methods or supplemental data sources are employed.",

The measurements at the 阿柔超级站 aim to provide insights into the turbulent exchange processes by leveraging the scintillometer's ability to capture fluctuations in the refractive index of air. This data, after processing and quality control, helps in validating and improving atmospheric models, which are crucial for climate studies and water resource management in the 黑河流域 region.",

These steps ensure the reliability of the data by filtering out measurements that could be inaccurate or unreliable due to environmental or instrumental factors.",
