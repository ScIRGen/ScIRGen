            "description": "1) The data includes the soil erosion modulus of 18 watersheds with a resolution of 5 m in the year of 2017 in Thailand. 2) Based on the surface layer of rainfall erosivity R, soil erodibility K, slope length factor LS, vegetation coverage FVC, and rotation sampling survey unit, the Chinese soil erosion model (CSLE) was used to calculate soil erosin modulus in 18 watersheds of Thailand respectively. Through spatial data processing (including chart linking and transformation, vector-grid conversion, and resampling),  R, K, LS factors were calculated from the regional thematic map of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and DEM. By half-month FVC, NPV, half-month rainfall erosivity data, we calculated the value of B factors  in each sampling watershed. The value of E factor was calculated based on the remote sensing interpretation result and engineering measure factor table. The value of tillage factor T was obtained from tillage zoning map and tillage measure table. And then the soil erosion modulus in each sampling watershed was calculated by the equation: A=R•K•LS•B•E•T. The selection of 18 watersheds was based on the layout of sampling survey in pan-third polar region. 3) Compared with the data of soil erosion intensity in the same region in the same year, there is no significant difference and the data quality is good.4) the data of soil erosion intensity is of great significance for studying the present situation of soil erosion in Pan third polar region and better implementation of the development policy of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.",
