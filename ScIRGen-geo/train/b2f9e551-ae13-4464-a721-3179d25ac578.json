            "description": "The surface PM2.5 concentration data of Tibet Plateau is named by date (YYYYMMDD). Each NC file contains one day's data, which is composed of PM2.5 concentration, longitude, latitude, and time information of the area (the corresponding variables in the data are named with PM2.5, lon, lat, time). The data inversion relies on the reanalysis data MERRA-2 released by NASA and the AOD product of Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). MERRA-2 is mainly based on NASA GMAO Earth system model version 5 (GEOS 5). The algorithm is able to assimilate all the in-situ and re- motely-sensed atmospheric data. This dataset mainly focuses on the aerosol field of MERRA-2. This is the first multi-decadal reanalysis within which meteorological and aerosol observations are jointly assimilated into a global assimilation system. MISR views Earth with cameras pointed in 9 different directions， which can help us know the amount of sunlight that is scattered in different directions under natural conditions. The main data products used in this data algorithm are MERRA-2 aerosol analysis product (M2T1NXAER) and MISR Level 3 version 4 global aerosol products (MIL3DAEN_4). Firstly, the ratio of PM2.5 to AOD in each grid was calculated by using the aerosol information provided by MERRA-2. Second, the PM2.5 concentration of the grid was calculated by multiplying the AOD of MISR by the ratio. The mean prediction error of PM2.5 concentration obtained by this method is within 20 μg/m3. The corresponding PM2.5 products can be used for the assessment of particulate pollution in the Tibet Plateau.",

Establishment of ground monitoring network is the ideal way to accurately measure ground-level PM 2.5 concentration, which is exactly why thousands of ground sites have been deployed in the United States and Western Europe. However, sparse geographic coverage of the network is not dense enough for monitoring PM2.5 at spatial scales of a few kilometers and maintaining such networks are very costly. It has been proved that satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), the column-integrated aerosol extinction, is a good surrogate for PM2.5."
