                "To simulate runoff and surface energy and moisture fluxes, land surface models (LSMs) require an appropriate description of soil water content. Most LSMs calculate soil water content by numerically solving the Richards equation. To simulate soil water content, h(u) and K(u) and their associated parameters should be determined prior to solving the above equation. However, soil hydraulic properties are highly heterogeneous in space, and their estimates are dependent on local soil characteristics. There is no unique way to relate soil hydraulic properties and soil characteristics. For this reason, various researchers proposed different empirical relationships of soil hydraulic parameters and soil characteristics, referred to as pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Land surface modelers have employed different PTFs to estimate soil hydraulic parameters. Direct measurement of parameters associated with h(u) and K(u) is difficult and in most cases impractical. It is also impossible to obtain sufficient numbers of direct measurements across a region to adequately reflect the spatial heterogeneity of soils. Thus, most soil databases do not provide soil hydraulic parameters associated with h(u) and K(u). Instead, they are usually obtained by PTFs from soil properties that are easily measured and widely available, such as particle size distribution, bulk density (BD), and soil organic matter (SOM) content. Land surface models for numerical weather prediction, climate modeling, and hydrological modeling usually use lookup tables of mean values of hydraulic parameters based on soil textural classes or continuous PTFs provided by Clapp and Hornberger (1978) and Cosby et al. (1984). The inability and uncertainty of PTFs in the estimation of soil hydraulic parameters can be attributed to factors as follows: 1) the intrinsic inability (i.e., PTF structural error) to accurately describe complex physical relationships (Tomasella et al. 2003), 2) the intrinsic inability or uncertainty caused by limited data used for PTF training, and 3) the uncertainty in PTF inputs to reflect soil spatial heterogeneity at different scales."

This study aims to develop a dataset of soil hydraulic parameters over regions of China for different PTFs. As land modelers, we expect that the dataset of the hydraulic parameters associated with FCH and FGM developed in this study could 1) describe spatial variability of the soil hydraulic characteristics in both vertical and horizontal directions, 2) provide multiple choices for users to use either a single set or an ensemble of hydraulic parameters associated with different PTFs, and 3) provide a benchmark dataset (the median values) from multiple PTFs or as a reference dataset."

We estimate the hydraulic parameters associated with h(u) and K(u) at 30 x 30 arc second resolution by employing multiple PTFs.

However, the accuracy remains unknown due to the lack of in situ and regional measurements.",

                    "Answer": "It is important because soil hydraulic properties are highly heterogeneous in space, and their estimates depend on local soil characteristics. There is no unique way to relate soil hydraulic properties and soil characteristics, which is why researchers have proposed different empirical relationships, or pedotransfer functions (PTFs), to estimate soil hydraulic parameters. These PTFs are crucial for land surface models as they provide a way to estimate parameters that are difficult or impractical to measure directly.",

It is also impossible to obtain sufficient numbers of direct measurements across a region to adequately reflect the spatial heterogeneity of soils. Therefore, using PTFs derived from soil properties that are easily measured and widely available offers a practical alternative to estimate soil hydraulic parameters.",
