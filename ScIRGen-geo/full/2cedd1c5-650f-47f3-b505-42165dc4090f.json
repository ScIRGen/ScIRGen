            "description": "Geladaindong ice core records could provide a unique opportunity for studying climatic and environmental changes in the central TP. Based on a 147 m deep ice core drilled by the Sino-US Cooperation Expedition in 2005 at Mt. Geladaindong, we analyzed oxygen and major ion by using MAT253 isotope mass spectrometer and Ion Chromatograph. Multiparametric dating approach is adopted to establish an accurate chronology. Glaciochemical records were reconstructed to reveal the annual climatic and environmental changes during the period of 1477~1982 AD.",
