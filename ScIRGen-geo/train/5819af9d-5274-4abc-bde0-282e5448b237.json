            "description": "The dataset of soil moisture observations was obtained by the cutting ring (50cm^3) and ML2X Soil Moisture Tachometer in the Linze station foci experimental area. Surface soil (0-5cm) was measured 2-3 times in 40 subplots of the west-east desert strip on May 24, 25, 28, Jun. 27 and Jul. 11, 2008, 2-4 times in 9 subplots of north-south strip on May 24, 25, 28, Jun. 27 and Jul. 11, 17 times from P1 to P6 strips on Jul. 4 and 8, nine times along LY06 strip on Jun. 6, 15, 29 and Jul. 11, LY07 strip on May 30, Jun. 6, 10, 15, 29 and Jul. 11 and LY08 strip on May 30, Jun. 6 and 10, and once by the cutting ring and three times by ML2X Soil Moisture Tachometer in Wulidun farmland quadrates on May 24, 25, 28, Jun. 29 and Jul. 11. Data were archived as Excel files. \n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",

                    "Answer": "The use of ring knives, which have a defined volume of 50 cm^3, suggests a focus on precise volumetric soil moisture measurements, which can be advantageous in obtaining consistent data across different observation sites. However, the challenge might lie in the manual labor involved and potential soil disturbance during sample collection. On the other hand, the ML2X soil moisture rapid measuring instrument allows for quicker measurements, which can be beneficial in covering larger areas within a limited timeframe, such as the dense observation period from May to July. This dual-method approach in specific sites like the Wulidun farmland sample plots indicates an attempt to balance precision and efficiency in data collection. The choice of instruments and methods might be influenced by the need for temporal and spatial resolution, as well as the logistical constraints of working in an arid desert environment.",

                    "Answer": "The necessity of using both the ring knife and the ML2X soil moisture rapid measurement instrument in specific sample plots, such as the Wulidun farmland sample plots, is likely due to the need for cross-verification of soil moisture data and the potential for different measurement requirements or challenges posed by the specific environmental or soil conditions in those plots.",

The ring knife, with a volume of 50 cm^3, is used for soil moisture measurements by collecting soil samples and determining their volume water content. The ML2X soil moisture speed tester provides rapid readings of soil moisture content and is particularly useful in agricultural plots like the Wulidun farmland sample plot. For optimal accuracy, it is beneficial to use the ring knife for consistency across most sample plots, while the ML2X can be employed for quick assessments or validation checks in certain areas. The procedural steps include preparing the sample plots, systematically collecting samples at specified depths (0-5 cm in this case), and ensuring that the measurements align with the pre-defined observation schedule. Data collection should be recorded meticulously in Excel for further analysis.",
