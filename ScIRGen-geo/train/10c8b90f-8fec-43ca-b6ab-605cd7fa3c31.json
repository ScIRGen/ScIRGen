            "description": "Permafrost has experienced extensive degradation, but our understanding of permafrost distribution is still limited, particularly in mountains, due to the highly heterogenous environments and lack of reliable field data. In this study, we integrated the available field data and rock glacier records to map the distribution of permafrost in the Qilian Mountains, located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. A total of 1,530 rock glacier records were combined with in situ data to drive machine learning models for estimating permafrost existence. Three machine learning algorithms were adopted, and their accuracies were assessed in both mountains and plains by comparing to reserved field data as well as other published permafrost datasets. The CatBoost model presented the highest accuracy with an overall accuracy of 83.3%, and it was finally chosen to produce a 250-m resolution permafrost zonation index (PZI) map, which identified a total area of 73.1×103 km2 permafrost in the Qilian Mountains, accounting for 39.1% of the area. The map also presented higher accuracy than that of other published permafrost maps, particularly in the mountainous regions, indicating the rock glacier records coupled with gradient-boosting machine-learning algorithms can help improve permafrost mapping, especially for the most challenging alpine permafrost.",
