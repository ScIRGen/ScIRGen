            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the national observatory on climatology at Zhangye-Zhangye flight zone on Jun. 29, 2008.\n     Intra-band data available for general users include Level-2C data (after geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections), Level-1B browse image (after intra-band matching) and Level-2B browse image (after registration). The raw data, Level-1A, and data processing parameters were filed; applications would be evaluated prior to access. Data processing started in Aug. 2008 and ended in Apr. 2009, and in Nov. 2009, CCD data were reprocessed to adjust radiometric calibration. \n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id\n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 2#5 || 1500m || 13:14:39 || 13:22:43 || 122 || processed;complete || good || National observatory on climatology at Zhangye;Gulou in Zhangye \n|-\n| 2 || 2#7 || 1500m || 13:28:23 || 13:35:31 || 108 || processed;complete || good\n|-　 \n| 3 || 2#9 || 1500m || 13:41:11 || 13:49:03 || 119 || processed;complete || good || wetland park in Zhangye\n|}",

Geometric correction is necessary to align the data spatially, radiometric calibration ensures that the sensor readings correspond to actual physical quantities, and atmospheric correction accounts for the effects of the atmosphere on the sensor data.

These processes improve the accuracy of spatial positioning (geometric correction), ensure consistent brightness and color (radiometric calibration), and compensate for atmospheric conditions (atmospheric correction) that may alter data readings. As a result, the processed data can be more reliably used for various analyses, such as climate observation and urban planning, by providing clearer and more accurate representations of the observed areas, such as the Zhangye National Climate Observatory and other sites in Zhangye.",

The original data is first subjected to geometric correction, followed by radiometric calibration to ensure the accuracy of the sensor's readings. Finally, atmospheric correction is applied to account for the influence of the atmosphere on the captured data. The processed data is made available as Level-2C products, which include all these corrections, as well as Level-1B and Level-2B quick views with band-to-band registration.
