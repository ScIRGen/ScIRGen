            "description": "The dataset of snow depth measured by the elevation-graduated snow sticks was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental area from Nov. 11 to 16, 2007, during the pre-observation period. 51 snow-stakes (2m long) were arranged according to different topographic landscapes, such as the flat, ubac, tailo and partial shade, and the length above the ground was recorded. From Mar. 2 to Apr. 6, 2008, the intensive observation period, ten measurements (Mar. 2, Mar. 4, Mar. 9, Mar. 16, Mar. 19, Mar. 21, Mar. 23, Mar. 29, Apr. 1 and Apr. 6) were carried out both manually and additionally by the telescope for the snow depth around the snow-stakes. Two files including raw data and preprocessed snow depth data were archived. Those provide reliable data for snow spatial heterogeneity study and snow accumulation and melt monitoring in the Binggou watershed.",

Rather than using field measurements, remote sensing (RS) is now more widely used in modelling snow because of its unique advantages in obtaining large-scale ground information (Seidel and Martinec, 2004). The snow cover area (SCA) can be observed with higher spatial resolution at near-infrared and visible wavelengths (Hall and Riggs, 2006). The spatial and temporal variations in the snow are fundamentally driven by the energy and mass balance. However, the main disadvantage of the MODIS sensor is that it is unable to record observations in cloud-covered regions (Gafurov and Bardossy, 2009)."
