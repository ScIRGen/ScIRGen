            "description": "Ground-based microwave radiometers (MWR) operating in the K- and V-band (20–60 GHz) for temperature and humidity observations, respectively, are most sensitive to the lowest part of the atmosphere. “The Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research programme (STEP)”, the TP-PROFILE project  construct a comprehensive troposphere observation network for studying the synoptic process and environment change on the TP. The MWR instrument used in this study was an MWP967KV temperature, humidity, and liquid profiler, which operates in eight K-band (22.235, 22.50, 23.035, 23.835, 25.00, 26.235, 28.0, and 30.0 GHz) and fourteen V-band (51.25, 51.760, 52.28, 52.8, 53.34, 53.85, 54.4, 54.94, 55.50, 56.02, 56.66, 57.29, 57.96, and 58.80 GHz) microwave channels. It measures the radiation intensity of the sky in 22 different frequency channels. A neural network retrieval method has been constructed to retrieve the temperature, water vapor density, and liquid water density profiles, as well as the CWV and LWP, from the brightness temperature measurements.  During the field experiment, the nine MWRs were configured to conduct zenith scans. Only the zenith scan data were used to retrieve the thermodynamic profiles of the troposphere up to 10 km, which were normally available every 2 minutes.，data format：Record\t Date/Time\t10\tTamb(C) （surface tempe）\tRh(%)\t（surface humidity）Pres(hPa)（pressure）\tTir(℃)\t（infared temperature）Rain（flag for rainfall）\tVint(cm) （0-10km column water vapor）\tLqint(mm) (0-10kmcolumn liquid water path)\tCloudBase(km，) （cloud base height）\t0.000km （0m above ground）\t0.050km （50m above ground）\t0.100km （100m above ground）\t0.150km （150m above ground）\t0.200km\t（200m above ground）0.250km\t（250m above ground）……9.750km\t（9.75km above ground）10.000km(10km above ground), nine sites inlude MAWORS，NADOR，Mangai，Naqu，Changdu，Leshan，QOMS，SETS，Kabu.",

This network was established as part of a scientific expedition project and collected data from January 2021 to June 2022. The network includes multiple observation stations, such as MAWORS, NADOR, Mangai, Naqu, Changdu, Leshan, QOMS, SETS, and Kabu. The dataset includes variables like atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles at different altitude layers, ranging from the surface to 10 km above ground, using 58-layer and 83-layer observation modes.",
