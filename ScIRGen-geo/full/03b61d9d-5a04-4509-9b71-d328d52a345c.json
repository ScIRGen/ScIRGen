It contains the daily mean surface air temperature and 3-hourly instantaneous surface air temperature. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.01°. Its time range for surface air temperature dataset is from 1979 to 2018. Spatial dimension of data: 73°E-106°E, 23°N-40°N.

In high altitude regions, SWD has become an important energy source for local people, due to the difficulties of long-distance energy supply. Meanwhile, downward longwave radiation (LWD) is an important parameter for frost prediction and for crop growing. There are only a few investigations that had been done to study the radiation conditions of high altitude regions."

This paper presents a pilot study over TP, the highest and largest plateau in the world. First, we investigate the characteristics of shortwave and longwave radiations over high altitude regions, and point out a necessary condition for a model to be applicable over high altitude regions. Then, we evaluate two types of estimates (surface data-based estimate and satellite data-based estimate) against a long-term instrumental data set over TP."

Therefore, suitable instrumental SWD and LWD data are invaluable but they are rarely available, and an effective method developed for estimating radiation occurring over high altitude regions is very important and urgently needed."

In this study, CMA provides long-term data sets of daily-mean air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine duration, and pressure, and thus provides a possibility to extend radiation data from satellite era to earlier decades. For the surface radiation modeling in this study, SWD is estimated by a hybrid model and LWD is estimated by CD99 model. At four CMA stations (SQH, Gerze, Naqu, Anduo) where experimental radiation data are available, SWD was estimated from CMA daily data of sunshine duration, air temperature, air pressure, and humidity by the hybrid model. The estimated SWD data together with CMA air temperature and humidity data were supplied into CD99 model, which, in turn, estimated LWD values."

On the contrary, SWD over TP is significantly higher than that over its surrounding areas, due to low extinction rate of airmass, water vapor, and aerosol occurred in TP. It is found that the surface data-based estimate, though not calibrated locally, shows a good agreement with the measurements and has an advantage of producing less root-mean-square errors and higher correlation coefficients than the satellite estimates."

This is achieved by using models or algorithms to refine coarser resolution data (e.g., 0.1°) into finer resolution data (e.g., 0.01°), thus providing more detailed information on temperature variations.",
