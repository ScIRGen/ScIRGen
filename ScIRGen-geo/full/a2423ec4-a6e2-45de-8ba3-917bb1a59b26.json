                "A thermokarst lake is generally defined as a lake that occupies a closed basin and is created by the massive melting of ground ice in ice-rich permafrost regions, which has a great impact on regional hydro-ecological equilibrium and permafrost-engineering infrastructure facilities. Global warming and increasing human activities have been accompanied by permafrost degradation and glacier retreat in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP). The QTP, known as the Third Pole, has a permafrost area of 115.02 × 104 km2, accounting for nearly 46% of its total area. Global warming in recent decades has been most pronounced at high altitude and has accelerated permafrost degradation. Scholars have demonstrated that thermokarst lakes are sensitive indicators of climate change and permafrost degradation. Recently, permafrost degradation at the global scale has attracted wide attention resulting from its remarkable environmental effects. Infrastructure stability, food security, water supply, and hydrological and habitat functions may be extensively influenced when a major area of permafrost becomes degraded."

In this study, permafrost data for the 1980s was derived from the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center, and the permafrost dataset for 2017 was provided by the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center. In this study, we identified thermokarst lakes as those lakes distributed in permafrost areas and not directly connected with rivers.
