            "description": "We comprehensively estimated water volume changes for 1132 lakes larger than 1 km2. Overall, the water mass stored in the lakes increased by 169.7±15.1 Gt (3.9±0.4 Gt yr-1) between 1976 and 2019, mainly in the Inner-TP (157.6±11.6 or 3.7±0.3 Gt yr-1). A substantial increase in mass occurred between 1995 and 2019 (214.9±12.7 Gt or 9.0±0.5 Gt yr-1), following a period of decrease (-45.2±8.2 Gt or -2.4±0.4 Gt yr-1) prior to 1995. A slowdown in the rate of water mass increase occurred between 2010 and 2015 (23.1±6.5 Gt or 4.6±1.3 Gt yr-1), followed again by a high value between 2015 and 2019 (65.7±6.7 Gt or 16.4±1.7 Gt yr-1). The increased lake-water mass occurred predominately in glacier-fed lakes (127.1±14.3 Gt) in contrast to non-glacier-fed lakes (42.6±4.9 Gt), and in endorheic lakes (161.9±14.0 Gt) against exorheic lakes (7.8±5.8 Gt) over 1976−2019.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of lake water volume changes in the Tibetan Plateau, 'ice-supplied lakes' refers to lakes whose water volume increases are primarily fed by meltwater from glaciers. These lakes showed a significant increase in water volume, accounting for 127.1±14.3 Gt, which is much higher compared to non-ice-supplied lakes. This substantial increase is attributed to the larger number and area of ice-supplied lakes.",

                    "Answer": "The methods used for estimating water volume changes in lakes larger than 1 km² on the Tibetan Plateau involve comprehensive estimations that account for glacial contributions, as evidenced by the larger increase in water volume in glacial-fed lakes compared to non-glacial-fed ones. This approach is particularly tailored to the characteristics of the Tibetan Plateau, where glacial contributions are significant.",

                    "Question": "What can be inferred about the environmental and climatic influences on lake water volume changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from the observed patterns between 1976 and 2019?",
                    "Answer": "The data indicates that lake water volume changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are significantly influenced by both climatic factors and geographical characteristics. The increase in water volume is primarily observed in closed basins, with a substantial contribution from glacier-fed lakes. The marked reduction in water volume from 1976 to 1995 followed by a significant increase from 1995 to 2019 suggests a shift in climatic conditions, possibly linked to changes in precipitation patterns and glacier melt rates. The data reveals that glacier-fed lakes contribute more to the increase in water volume, indicating that glacier dynamics play a critical role in hydrological changes in this region. Additionally, the slowing of water volume increase between 2010 and 2015 followed by another surge could reflect short-term climatic variations or human interventions affecting water balance.",

                    "Answer": "The increase in lake water volume on the Tibetan Plateau from 1995 to 2019 can be attributed to several factors, including increased ice melt contributing to glacier-fed lakes, which saw a significant increase of 127.1±14.3 Gt. This is much higher compared to non-glacier-fed lakes, which increased by 42.6±4.9 Gt. Additionally, closed lakes experienced a greater increase in water volume (161.9±14.0 Gt) compared to open lakes (7.8±5.8 Gt), indicating the influence of regional hydrological and climatic changes.",

                    "Answer": "The increase in water volume for glacier-fed lakes (127.1±14.3 Gt) is significantly higher than that for non-glacier-fed lakes (42.6±4.9 Gt), which could be attributed to the larger number and area of glacier-fed lakes. This suggests that glacier-fed lakes have been more significantly impacted by glacial meltwater contributions over the period from 1976 to 2019.",
