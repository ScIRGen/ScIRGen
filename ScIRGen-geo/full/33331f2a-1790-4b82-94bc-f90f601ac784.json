            "description": "There are many controversies about the age, genesis and dynamic background of the nearly EW trending magmatic belt from southern Hunan to southern Jiangxi to northern Guangdong to southwestern Fujian in Nanling area. The Daping gabbro vein in Yongding area, southwest Fujian Province, is studied in this paper. On the basis of detailed field work and microscopic petrographic observation, the U-Pb isotopic dating of plagioclase, the contents of major and trace elements in the whole rock and the SR Nd isotopic ratio of the gabbro vein are measured. The zircon U-Pb isotopic dating data are obtained by ICP-MS analysis. The main and micro element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, and the SR Nd isotopic composition was obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. The isotopic age is 184.0 ± 5 mA, indicating that the magmatism was in the early Jurassic. The initial value of (87Sr / 86Sr) I varies from 0.7080 to 0.7090, ε Nd (T) values range from - 3.6 to - 3.0, indicating that gabbro dikes originated from partial melting of enriched lithospheric mantle and did not experience AFC of crust derived materials. Bimodal volcanic rocks and A-type granites are developed simultaneously in the area, which indicates that the magmatic belt including Yongding was in the dynamic background of extension in early Jurassic. Asthenosphere upwelling and heating EMI type enriched lithospheric mantle formed Fankeng formation basalt and Yongding Daping gabbro vein respectively.\nThe above data have been published in Chinese core journals, and the data are true and reliable.",

This technique involves measuring the ratios of uranium and lead isotopes in zircon minerals to determine the age of rock formations. In this field, this method is used to establish the isotopic age of rock formations, such as the 永定大坪辉长岩脉, providing insights into their geological history and the timing of magmatic activities.",

                    "Answer": "The isotopic dating data, specifically the zircon U-Pb age of 184.0±6.5 Ma, indicates that the magmatic activities occurred during the early Jurassic period. The geochemical characteristics, such as high alkali and high potassium content, along with the absence of positive anomalies for Nb and Ta, suggest that the gabbro dyke originated from partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle without experiencing crustal contamination. This implies that during the early Jurassic, the region was under an extensional tectonic regime, leading to asthenospheric upwelling and heating of the enriched lithospheric mantle, contributing to the formation of bimodal volcanic rocks and A-type granites in the area.",

Accurate data collection requires detailed fieldwork, petrographic observations, and the use of precise analytical techniques such as ICP-MS for zircon U-Pb dating, XRF for whole-rock elemental analysis, and MC-ICP-MS for Sr-Nd isotope ratios.",

                    "Answer": "Using Sr-Nd isotope composition analysis through MC-ICP-MS allows researchers to determine the isotopic values, which in this case varied between 0.7080 to 0.7090 for (87Sr/86Sr)i and -3.6 to -3.0 for εNd(t). These results indicate that the gabbro dikes originated from partial melting of the enriched lithospheric mantle without undergoing AFC processes of crustal material. This analysis helps in understanding the magmatic activity as being influenced by the upwelling of the asthenosphere and heating of the EMII-type enriched lithospheric mantle in a tectonic extensional context during the early Jurassic.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of utilizing zircon U-Pb isotope dating, whole-rock major and trace element content analysis, and Sr-Nd isotope ratio testing are to determine the age, origin, and geodynamic background of the magmatic activities in the Nanling region. These methods aim to provide insights into the characteristics of the Daping gabbro dikes, including their high alkali and high potassium geochemical features, and to establish their formation from partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle without crustal assimilation.
