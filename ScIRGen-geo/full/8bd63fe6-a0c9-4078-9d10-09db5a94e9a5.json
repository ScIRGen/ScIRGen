            "description": "The mass balance of glaciers and the volume changes in glacial lakes are key prerequisites for understanding the contribution of glacier meltwater to glacial lake variations. This study focuses on the glaciers in the Ak-Shyirak region of the Central Tianshan and the Petrov proglacial lake. First, glacier and glacial lake boundaries in the region were delineated using visual interpretation based on KH-9 and Landsat series imagery. Second, glacier thickness changes were quantified using the DEM differencing method, employing datasets such as KH-9 DEM, SRTM-C/X DEM, and ASTER DEM. Subsequently, the intra-annual fluctuations and inter-annual trends of Petrov Lake’s water level were assessed through a periodic fluctuation model, utilizing ICESat-2 laser altimetry and Sentinel-3 radar altimetry data. The processed results were cross-validated, and uncertainty was analyzed before being compared with previous studies to ensure reliability and adherence to scientific standards. These datasets can be used for parameter calibration in glacier evolution models and glacial lake outburst flood models, as well as for future analyses of changes in glacier and glacial lake dynamics.",
