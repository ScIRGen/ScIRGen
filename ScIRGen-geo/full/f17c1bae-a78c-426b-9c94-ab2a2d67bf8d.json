            "description": "Tibetan Plateau with high altitude,cold climate,poor natural conditions and fragile ecological environment become the sensitive and promoter region of global climate change.Studying for Land reclamation of historical period in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not only the specific way to participate in the global environmental change, but also can provide the comprehensive research of land use change with abundant regional information,there is important significance  for studying history in our country even the whole world of land use/cover change research.The region of Brahmaputra River and its two tributaries in Tibetan Plateau pastoral transitional zone is one of the important typical agricultural area, and is the area with the most intense land reclamation activities and the fastest population growing.Proceeding deep historical data mining in the study area to reconstruct the cropland spatial patterns over the past 300 years has important significance to study the human land use activities under the background of  global climate change. This data contains raster data on the spatial distribution pattern of arable land  in Brahmaputra River and Its Two Tributaries in 1730  with a spatial resolution of 500m*500m.The data of cultivated land in 1730 comes from tiehu Inventory，the missing data of  two counties were interpolated.The land area recorded in the data is converted into modern mu units, and the missing counties are calculated using the area's per capita cultivated land and population.",

These records are converted into modern measurement units, and for regions with missing data, estimations are made based on average per capita cultivated land and population figures. The unique ecological and climatic conditions of the Tibetan Plateau, being a vulnerable area to global climate change, also play a significant role in understanding these patterns.",

This includes converting historical land area measurements into modern units such as mu. For areas with missing data, researchers can estimate land use patterns using metrics like per capita cultivated land area and population numbers. These reconstructed datasets help examine human land use activities in the context of global climate change.",
