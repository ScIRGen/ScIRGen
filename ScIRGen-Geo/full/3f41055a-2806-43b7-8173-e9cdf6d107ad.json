      "description": "There are many lakes in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The glacial phenology and duration of lakes in this region are very sensitive to regional and global climate change, so they are used as the key indicators of climate change research, especially the comparative study of the three polar environmental changes of the earth. However, due to its poor natural environment and sparse population, there is a lack of conventional field measurement of lake ice phenology. The lake ice was monitored with a resolution of 500 meters by using the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) data of MODIS. The traditional snow map algorithm is used to detect the lake daily ice amount and coverage under the condition of sunny days, and the lake daily ice amount and coverage under the condition of cloud cover are re determined through a series of steps based on the spatiotemporal continuity of the lake surface conditions. Through time series analysis, 308 lakes larger than 3km2 are identified as effective records of lake ice range and coverage, forming a daily lake ice range and coverage data set, including 216 lakes.",
      "descriptionCn": "青藏高原湖泊众多，该地区湖泊冰期物候和持续时间对区域和全球气候变化非常敏感，因此被用作气候变化研究的关键指标，特别是地球三极环境变化对比研究。但由于其自然环境恶劣，人口稀少，缺乏对湖泊冰物候的常规现场测量。利用中分辨率成像光谱仪(MODIS)归一化差雪指数(NDSI)数据，以500米的分辨率对湖泊冰进行了监测，填补了观测空白。利用传统的雪图算法对晴天条件下的湖泊日冰量和覆盖范围进行检测，利用湖泊表面条件的时空连续性，通过一系列步骤对云层覆盖条件下的湖泊日冰量和覆盖范围进行重新确定。通过时间序列分析308个大于3km2的湖泊确定为湖冰范围和覆盖的有效记录,形成每日湖冰范围和覆盖数据集,包括216个湖泊。",

        "Known as the \"Roof of the World,\" the Tibetan Plateau has an average elevation of more than 2,000 m and an abundance of lakes. Lake ice is an indicator of changes in lake environments; moreover, it is also one of the key Environmental Climate Variables (ECVs) in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). However, the existing in situ lake ice observation data for the Tibetan Plateau is severely limited due to the remoteness, harsh eco-environmental conditions, and thin atmosphere in this region. At present, many researchers have studied the lake ice phenology based on remote sensing data and released four data sets, but the dataset derived primarily from coarse resolution passive microwave observations is not effective for monitoring the numerous small lakes in the Tibetan Plateau."

The dataset presented herein was prepared using the MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) with a spatial resolution of 500 m as input for the NDSI snow cover algorithm SNOWMAP in order to detect the lake ice coverage under daily clear sky conditions. This method was used to calculate and classify the daily lake ice characteristics for the maximum number of lakes within the Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2018."

The NDSI snow cover algorithm SNOWMAP was used to estimate the daily lake ice on/off at a single pixel under clear sky, and then a series of further processes was conducted under cloudy conditions based on spatial and temporal continuity of lake surface conditions. Based on the complementary morning and afternoon satellite observations, daily lake ice/water data under cloud cover conditions was synthesized based on the following three rules. The cloud-covered pixels were re-identified using spatial adjacent relationships and its spatial continuity based on their proximity. Aiming to obtain the inventory of lake ice/water change characteristics for every single lake, a further time series filter was conducted for each lake with ice, water, and cloud."

As a result, the lake ice extent data with partial cloud cover were obtained for 5,834 days, and lake ice, water and cloud coverage for each single lake, which was defined as the ratio of extent of lake ice and lake area, were obtained accordingly. Of total 2612 examined lakes in Tibetan Plateau, the 5834 days’ time series of cloud free time series of lake ice coverage for 625 lakes with areas larger than 3 km2 were effectively recorded."
