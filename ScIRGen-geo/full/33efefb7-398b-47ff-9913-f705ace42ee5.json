            "description": "ET（Evapotranspiration）monitoring is essential for agricultural water management, regional water resources utilization planning, and socio-economic sustainable development.The limitations of the traditional monitoring ET method are mainly that large-area simultaneous observations cannot be made and can only be limited to observation points. Therefore, the cost of personnel and equipment is relatively high, and it is unable to provide ET data on the surface, nor to provide the ET data of different land use types and crop types.\nQuantitative monitoring of ET can be achieved by remote sensing. The characteristics of remote sensing information are that it can reflect both the macroscopic structural characteristics of the Earth's surface and the microscopic local differences.\nMonthly evapotranspiration datasets (2000-2013) with 30m spatial resolution over oasis in the Middle Reaches of Heihe River Basin Version 1.0 are based on multi-source remote sensing data. The latest ET Watch model is used to estimate the raster image data. Its temporal resolution is monthly and spatial resolution is 30 meters. The data cover the middle reaches of Zhangye oasis area in millimeters. The data types include month, quarter, and year data.\nThe projection information of the data is as follows:\nAlbers equivalent conical projection,\nCentral meridian: 110 degrees,\nFirst secant: 25 degrees,\nSecond secant: 47 degrees,\nCoordinate west deviation: 4000000 meters.\nThe file naming rules are as follows:\nMonthly cumulative ET value file name: heihe-midoasis-30m_2013m01_eta.tif\nAmong them, heihe indicates the Heihe River Basin, midoasis indicates the middle oasis area, 30m indicates the resolution is 30 meters, 2013 indicates 2013, m01 indicates January, eta indicates actual evapotranspiration data, and tif indicates that the data is in tif format;\nThe ET value file for each season is named: heihe-midoasis-30m_2013s01_eta.tif\nAmong them, heihe indicates the Heihe River Basin, midoasis indicates the middle oasis area, 30m indicates the resolution is 30 meters, 2013 indicates 2013, s01 indicates 1-3 months, for the first quarter, eta indicates actual evapotranspiration data, and tif indicates that the data is in tif format;\nThe annual cumulative value file name: heihe-midoasis-30m_2013y_eta.tif\nAmong them, heihe indicates the Heihe River Basin, midoasis indicates the middle oasis area, 30m indicates the resolution is 30 meters, 2013 indicates 2013, y indicates the year, eta indicates the actual evapotranspiration data, and tif indicates that the data is in tif format.",

Image fusion can complement different information, improve spatial resolution, and provide clarity and synthetic analysis precision. Much research has been completed on scale transformation of the land surface parameters. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and TM data are commonly used data in remote sensing ET. We can obtain ET data sets in 1 km and 30 m spatial resolutions. The number of MODIS data sets is much more than TM data. In order to obtain a high spatial and temporal resolution ET data set, we must fuse the data in different spatial and temporal resolutions from different sensors. Many factors and parameters affect the calculation of ET. It is difficult to perform a data fusion with only input parameters. The non-linear change in data fusion causes much uncertainty in calibrating the parameters and spatial and temporal distribution analysis. Remote sensing ET data fusion needs to integrate the characteristics of input data in spatial distribution and on a temporal scale."
