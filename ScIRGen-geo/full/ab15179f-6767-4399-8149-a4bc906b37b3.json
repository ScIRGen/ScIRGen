            "description": "The super sample plot is composed of 16 sub samples. In order to locate each tree in the sample plot and facilitate the location of the base station point for ground-based radar observation, it is necessary to measure the geodetic coordinates of the sub sample plot corner point and the preset base station point for ground-based radar. The location of these points and each tree is measured by total station. Because the total station measures relative coordinates, in order to obtain geodetic coordinates, it is necessary to use differential GPS (DGPS) to measure at least one reference point around the super sample plot with high precision. In addition, we also use DGPS to observe the geodetic coordinates of all corner points of the subsample, and the measurement results can form the verification of the total station measurement results. The data set is based on all the positioning results measured by DGPS, excluding the positioning results of total station. \nThe measurement time is from June 1 to 13, 2008, using the French Thales differential GPS measurement system, model z-max. The observation method is to use two GPS receivers for synchronous static measurement, one is the base station, which is set next to Gansu Water Conservation Forest Research Institute (the WGS geodetic coordinate of the base station is a first-class benchmark introduced from Zhangye City through multi station observation using z-max). The other is the mobile station, which is placed on the observation point of super sample plot. The observation time of each point varies from 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes. The specific time depends on the satellite signal. The signal difference time is measured for several minutes more. Finally, the final positioning result is obtained by using the processing software of the instrument. WGS geodetic coordinate system is used for the positioning results. \nFirstly, six temporary control points were measured in the open area next to the super sample plot, providing reference points for the total station to measure the position of trees in the super sample plot. Then, flow stations were set up on each corner of 16 sub plots of super plot, and the coordinates of corner points were measured, and 41 observation points were obtained. The dataset stores the positioning results of these 47 points. \nThis data is only for project use and not for external sharing.",

Forest biomass is the energy basis and nutrient source for the functioning of the entire forest ecosystem, and it is fundamental for studying forest productivity, net primary productivity, carbon cycling, and global change research. Currently, the estimation of regional forest biomass mainly relies on stratified sampling techniques that involve establishing a large number of ground measurement plots, followed by statistical methods for estimation. Methods based on radar and LiDAR have become a research hotspot both domestically and internationally. Traditional single-angle optical remote sensing data primarily provide spectral information and horizontal structural information of vegetation, lacking vertical structural information. As biomass increases, remote sensing signals are prone to saturation. Radar data with longer wavelengths can provide vertical structural information of vegetation; however, airborne and spaceborne polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar data are still quite difficult to obtain. The rapid development and commercialization of airborne systems currently offer a promising technological means for estimating forest parameters."
