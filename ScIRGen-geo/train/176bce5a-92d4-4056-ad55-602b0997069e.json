            "description": "This data includes whole-rock major and trace geochemical data such as leucogranite and pegmatite, major and trace data of gold emerald and tourmaline, zircon chronology isotope data, and quartz isotope and trace data. The samples were collected from the Shisayi pluton in Tugmanta, Altyn Tagh. The main geochemical data of the whole rock are measured by XRF, the trace element data of the whole rock are obtained by laser mass spectrometry of Wuhan Shangpu company, the main and trace element data of tourmaline are obtained by electron microprobe and laser mass spectrometry respectively, and the micro and oxygen isotopes of quartz are obtained by laser mass spectrometry and Sims respectively. The evolving relationship between leucogranite and pegmatite is obtained from the whole rock data. The formation of zircon bound granite and pegmatite is 480-490Ma, while the trace isotope data of tourmaline and quartz can judge the enrichment of rare elements in the metamorphic process and magmatic process. Finally, it is inferred that the metamorphic process has no contribution to the enrichment of lithium beryllium.",

                    "Answer": "'全岩主微量地球化学数据' refers to the whole-rock major and trace geochemical data, which are crucial for understanding the composition and evolution of rock formations. In geological studies, these data are typically collected using techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for major elements and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for trace elements.

                    "Answer": "The selection of analytical techniques like XRF for whole-rock major geochemical data and laser mass spectrometry for trace data and isotopic analysis is driven by their ability to accurately quantify elemental concentrations and isotopic compositions. XRF is used for its precision in measuring major elements in bulk samples, while laser mass spectrometry is preferred for its sensitivity and accuracy in obtaining trace element data and isotopic ratios, necessary for understanding the evolution of granitic and pegmatitic rocks. These methods facilitate the examination of metamorphic and magmatic processes, especially in determining rare element enrichment.",

                    "Answer": "Using multiple analytical techniques allows for a comprehensive understanding of the geochemical and isotopic characteristics of granitic rocks. XRF provides major geochemical data, laser mass spectrometry offers trace element data, and electron probe microanalysis yields detailed mineral data. Together, these methods enable researchers to delineate the evolutionary relationship between granitic rocks and pegmatites, constrain their formation ages, and assess the role of metamorphic and magmatic processes in rare element enrichment, specifically indicating that metamorphic processes do not contribute to lithium and beryllium enrichment.",

                    "Answer": "To accurately measure the geochemical composition and isotopic data of minerals such as zircon and tourmaline, various techniques are utilized. For whole-rock major geochemical data, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is typically used, while trace element data can be obtained through laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). For tourmaline, major and trace elements can be measured using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and LA-ICP-MS. Zircon isotopic data, crucial for understanding magmatic processes, is often gathered using laser ablation techniques, while quartz isotopic and trace data can be obtained using LA-ICP-MS and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). These methods are integral for determining the evolutionary relationship between different rock types and assessing rare element enrichment during metamorphic and magmatic processes.",
