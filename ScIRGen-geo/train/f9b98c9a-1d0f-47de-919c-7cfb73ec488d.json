            "description": "This dataset includes stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonates in a 180 m-long sediment core retrieved from Lop Nor, Tarim Basin. Sedimentary carbon and oxygen isotopes from carbonates are two of the most commonly used proxies in paleoclimatic studies, as they have the potential to record past variations in hydrology and vegetation. The sediment samples were grounded and sieved through a 100 mesh screen, and then directly analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (MAT-252) with an automated carbonate preparation device (Kiel Ⅱ). Typical analytical errors are within ±0.06‰ and ±0.08‰ for carbon isotope and oxygen isotope, respectively. Based on the high-resolution stable carbon and oxygen isotope data of core Lop Nor, the evolution history of arid environment in the Taklimakan Desert since the Pleistocene can be reconstructed, allowing further exploring of trends, variability and mechanisms of regional climate change. Field photos dataset of the Tibetan Plateau include photos of the stratigraphic profiles.",

Although the onset of Asian desertification is proposed to have started in the earliest Miocene, prevailing desert environment in the Tarim Basin, currently providing much of the Asian eolian dust sources, is only a geologically recent phenomenon. Once part of the Neo-Tethys Sea, indicated by the Paleogene littoral-neritic deposits with intercalated marine strata, the Tarim Basin in western China has experienced dramatic environmental and depositional changes during the Cenozoic. The Tibetan Plateau uplift, long-term global cooling, and the associated retreat of the remnant sea during the Cenozoic, through their complex interplay, may have all contributed to the enhanced aridification in the Asian interior and eventually the desert formation. The existing evidence, although still limited, would point to the occurrence of a possible megalake in the Tarim Basin during the Late Miocene."

Superimposed on the orbitally episodic changes, the δ18O record also shows a long-term trend of deteriorating lacustrine conditions at 4.9–7.1 Ma. Therefore, our multiple-proxy results consistently show that the Taklimakan sand sea began to form at ∼4.9 Ma and that the transition into prevailing desert environment was permanent and irreversible."

                    "Answer": "The development of additional geochemical indicators could significantly enhance the understanding of episodic environmental changes by providing complementary data that can help differentiate between various depositional environments and climatic conditions. This multi-proxy approach can lead to a more comprehensive reconstruction of past environments, especially in complex regions like arid basins.",

                    "Answer": "Isotope analysis, such as the carbon and oxygen isotopes in carbonates, can provide information on past hydrological and vegetation conditions because they record changes in the environment over time. These isotopic signatures reflect factors like precipitation, evaporation, and plant types that influenced the area's climate in the geological past.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in orbital cycles, such as changes in Earth's tilt and orbit, affect climate patterns over geological timescales. These cycles can induce shifts between lacustrine (lake) and fluvial-eolian (river and wind-driven) environments, as observed in sedimentary records. Such changes are recorded in isotopic data, indicating alternating wet and dry periods influenced by orbital variations.",

                    "Answer": "One potential challenge in collecting isotope data from sediment cores in arid environments such as the Tarim Basin is ensuring the accuracy and precision of isotope measurements due to the complex interplay of factors affecting the isotopic composition, such as past hydrological and vegetational changes. Another challenge may involve the preservation of sediment cores, as arid conditions can lead to erosion or degradation of geological samples. Additionally, the handling of large volumes of sediment required for comprehensive δ11B, δ18O, and CaCO3 analyses may present logistical difficulties.",

                    "Answer": "To enhance the understanding of past environmental changes using isotopic records from sediment cores, a research approach could involve combining high-resolution isotope analysis with other geochemical and sedimentological proxies. This could include calibrating isotopic records with paleoenvironmental models and comparing findings with regional climate and tectonic data. Cross-referencing isotopic data with organic carbon content and other mineral composition analyses could provide a more comprehensive understanding of historical environmental conditions.",
