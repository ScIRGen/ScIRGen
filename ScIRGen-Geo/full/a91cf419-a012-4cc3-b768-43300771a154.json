      "description": "This dataset contains the automatic weather station (AWS) measurements from site No.8 in the flux observation matrix from 14 May to 21 September, 2012. The site (100.37649° E, 38.87254° N) was located in a cropland (maize surface) in Yingke irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1550.06 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity (HMP45AC; 5 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), wind speed and direction (010C/020C; 10 m, towards north), a four-component radiometer (CNR4; 6 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, vertically downward), soil temperature profile (109ss-L; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), and soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates with one below the vegetation and the other between plants, 0.06 m). \nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), air pressure (press, hpa), precipitation (rain, mm), wind speed (Ws_10 m, m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m, °), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation; W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IR_2, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, below the vegetation; Gs_2 and Gs_3, W/m^2), soil temperature profile (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_60 cm, and Ts_100 cm, ℃), and soil moisture profile (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_60 cm, and Ms_100 cm, %).\n            The data processing and quality control steps were as follows. (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min; therefore, there were 144 records per day. The missing data were filled with -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) In this dataset, the time of 0:10 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:10; the data were stored in *.xlsx format. (5) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

        "The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model was successfully applied to estimate evaporation (E), transpiration (T), and evapotranspiration (ET) for land covered with vegetation, which has significantly important applications for the terrestrial water cycle and water resource management. One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
        "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
        "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime. The ground-based measurement data were applied to partition ET into E and T applying the Craig–Gordon model.",

In addition, the soil and canopy sensible heat fluxes were estimated using the series TSEB model, and their latent heat fluxes were calculated while solving the energy balance equations (1) and (2), respectively. The soil and canopy component temperatures were calculated using the images obtained with the thermal camera. To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities. Next, the simulated radiometric temperatures were validated against the surface radiometric temperatures, which were calculated according to the incoming long-wave radiation observed by the four-component radiometer."
