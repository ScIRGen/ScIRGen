            "description": "The dataset is the Landsat surface reflectance products of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau, it is the key input  parameter of many surface geophysical parameters (such as leaf area index, chlorophyll and biomass). The dataset is retrieved based on Landsat level 4 products from China satellite remote sensing ground station, and it is retrived by using the atmospheric correction based on 6S model and BRDF correction model based on C-factor .The RMSE of geometric correction is less than 12m and the RMSD of surface reflectance is less than 5%. And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.The Landsat surface reflectance play an important role in forest, water resources, climate change.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the land surface reflectance result of each scense are stored in a floder including the land surface reflectance band, QA file, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF;the land surface reflectance bands are stored as GeoTIFF format and their named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-BX(X represents the number of bands).TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-B1.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type, so it needs to be mutiplied 0.00001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
