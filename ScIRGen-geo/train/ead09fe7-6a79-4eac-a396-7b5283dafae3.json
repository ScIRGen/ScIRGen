                    "Answer": "The consequences could include changes in water resource availability due to glacier retreat or advance, potentially impacting agriculture and local water supply. Shifts in climate patterns may affect biodiversity and ecosystems, which in turn could influence tourism and local economies. Additionally, variations in weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation could pose challenges for infrastructure and community resilience in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of collecting meteorological and glaciological data in the Lijiang-Yulong Snow Mountain area are to understand the climate and glacier evolution in the Southwest Monsoon region and its impact on local resources and sustainable development. This data collection aims to provide insights into the changes in glaciers, such as mass balance, terminus retreat, and ice temperature, and to analyze meteorological parameters like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. These datasets contribute to assessing how environmental changes affect water resources, ecological balance, and regional development strategies in the area.",
