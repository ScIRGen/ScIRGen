            "description": "The dataset of eddy covariance observations was obtained at the A'rou freeze/thaw observation station from Jul. 14, 2008 to Dec. 31, 2010, in Wawangtan pasture (E100°28′/N38°03′, 3032.8m), Daban, A'rou. The experimental area with a flat and open terrain slightly sloping from southeast to northwest and hills and mountains stretching outwards is an ideal horizontal homogeneous underlying surface. \n     The original observation items included the latitudinal wind speed Ux (m/s), the latitudinal wind speed Uy (m/s), the longitudinal wind speed Uz (m/s), the ultrasonic temperature Ts (°C), co2 consistency (mg/m^3), h2o consistency (g/m^3), air pressure (KPa) and the abnormal ultrasonic signal (diag_csat). The instrument height was 2.81m, the ultrasound direction was at an azimuth angle of 0°, the distance between Li7500 and CSAT3 was 30m and sampling frequency was 10HZ/s. The instrument mount was 3.15m, the ultrasound direction was at an azimuth angle of 86°, the distance between Li7500 and CSAT3 was 22cm and sampling frequency was 10HZ/s.\n     The dataset was released at three levels: Level0 were the raw data acquired by instruments; Level1, including the sensible heat flux (Hs), the latent heat flux (LE_wpl), and co2 flux (Fc_wpl), were real-time eddy covariance output data and stored in .csv month by month; Level2 were processed data in a 30-minute cycle after outliers elimination, coordinates rotation, frequency response correction, WPL correction and initial quality control. The data were named as follows: station name +data level+data acquisition date. As for detailed information, please refer to Meteorological and Hydrological Flux Data Guide and Eddy Covariance Observation Manual.",

Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness of only tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Because the observation scale of LAS matches well with satellite pixel scales and the grid scales of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth at the pixel/grid scale for remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the observed atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."
