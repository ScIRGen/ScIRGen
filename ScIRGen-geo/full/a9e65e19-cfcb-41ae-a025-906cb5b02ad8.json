            "description": "Inland water system and river basin regional dataset are the key hydrological parameters in the study of global change. Waterr distribution is of great significance to the study of the characteristics, morphological characteristics, changes, time distribution of various types of water bodies at the nodes, and the law of regional differentiation. The basic data is downloaded from DIVA-GIS, and is subset and resampled by administrative boundary dataset of all 31 key nodes as the research areas. The data concludes the distribution of lakes and reservoirs (planar River system) and rivers (linear River basin) . Finally, the data of water system and river basin in 31 key node regions are stored and obtained. This data set serves as the research basis for all hydrological remote sensing data and provides hydrological base data for the project. This data set can be updated in real time according to the government information and the changing trend of water system where node is located.",
