La shan au in the study area is located in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region of mesozoic-cenozoic in iminqak, according to the different height and diameter at breast height of iminqak, choose sampling tree installation TDP (Thermal Dissipation SAP flow velocity Probe, Thermal diffusion flow meter), domestic TDP pin type Thermal diffusion stem flow meter, the model for TDP30.The sample sites are TDP1 point and TDP2 point respectively, which are located near the mixed forest station and populus populus station.The height of the sample tree is TDP2 and TDP1 from high to low, and the diameter of the chest is TDP1 and TDP2 from large to small, so as to measure the trunk fluid flow on behalf of the whole area.The installation height of the probe is 1.3 meters and the installation orientation is due east and west of the sample tree.\nThe original observation data of TDP is the temperature difference between probes, which is collected once for 10s and the average output period is 10 minutes.The published data are calculated and processed trunk flow data, including flow rate (cm/h), flux (cm3/h) and daily transpiration (mm/d) per 10 minutes.Firstly, the liquid flow rate and liquid flux were calculated according to the temperature difference between the probes, and then the transpiration Q per unit area of the forest zone was calculated according to the area of Euphrates poplar forest and the distance between trees at the observation points.At the same time, post-processing was carried out on the calculated rate and flux value :(1) data that obviously exceeded the physical significance or the instrument range were removed;(2) the missing data is marked with -6999;Among them, the data of TDP2 was missing due to power supply problems from 1.1-2.8 days, and the data of the third group of probes was missing from 2.8-3.13 days due to the problems of the third group of probes.(3) suspicious data caused by probe fault or other reasons shall be identified in red, and the data confirmed to have problems shall be removed.\nPlease refer to Li et al.(2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Qiao et al.(2015) for observation data processing.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
