            "description": "According to the sample survey data, in August 2013, 30 forest plots were set up in the Tianlaochi watershed, with a plot size of 10 m×20 m. The long side of the plot was parallel to the slope of the hillside, including 26 blocks of Picea crassifolia forest. 2 blocks of Sabina Przewalsskii forest and 2 mixed forests of Picea and Sabina. In the plot, the diameter of the breast of each tree (the diameter of the trunk at a height of 1.3 m) is measured by a diameter tape, and the height of each tree and the height under the branches (the height of the first live branch at the lower end of the canopy) is measured by a hand-held ultrasonic altimeter. The north-south direction and the east-west crown width are measured with a tape measure, and the sample site is positioned by differential GPS.\nThe parallel version of HASM-AD algorithm is used to simulate the classified LIDAR point cloud data. DEM is generated from ground points, DSM is generated from all points, and the height of surface features is obtained by differential operation between DSM and DEM. In forest area, it is called Canopy Height Model (CHM). A circular window with a given search radius is used to find the local maximum value on CHM. If the central pixel value is the maximum value, it is determined as the crown vertex. The pixel attribute value of the tree vertex is the tree height, and the spatial resolution is 1m.",

Nilsson calculated tree height by computing the time interval between the first and last echoes and extracted average tree height using radar data with different laser divergences, indicating that the divergence has minimal impact on tree height extraction accuracy. Hudak et al. studied the applicability of low-density radar point cloud data in large-scale forest parameter extraction, showing that point cloud data with a 250 m sampling interval can effectively extract forest parameters in intensively managed forests in western Oregon. The prerequisite for extracting tree height is to interpolate radar point cloud data to generate DEM and DSM. Previous related studies have not specifically discussed the generation of DEM and DSM, often using classical conventional interpolation methods, neglecting the impact of interpolation methods on the accuracy of the generated DEM and DSM. Research has shown that the HASM method's accuracy in DEM construction is significantly higher than that of classical interpolation methods."
