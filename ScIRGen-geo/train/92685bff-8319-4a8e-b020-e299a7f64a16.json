            "description": "This dataset employs the Climate Adaptive Transfer Learning (CATL) framework to generate a daily-scale dataset of soil moisture in the Tibetan Plateau from 1961 to 2019, with a spatial resolution of 0.05°. The dataset integrates ERA5-LAND reanalysis data with in-situ measurement data provided by the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of soil moisture estimates in data-scarce regions.\n\nThe dataset is developed by selecting source domains with climatic features similar to the Tibetan Plateau and using a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By training within the source domains and then fine-tuning the model for the target domain, namely the Tibetan Plateau, this strategy not only fully leverages the long-term spatiotemporal advantages of the ERA5-LAND dataset but also effectively reduces the inherent error in the data and alleviates the issue of scarce soil water ground station data in the Tibetan Plateau region.\n\nPerformance validation of the dataset shows that it has a higher correlation coefficient (CC=0.755) and lower unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE=0.042) compared to the SMAPL3 data between 2015 and 2019. Moreover, in the historical data reconstruction from 1961 to 2010, the dataset achieved an 11.3% improvement in correlation coefficient and a 1.5% reduction in unbiased Root Mean Square Error compared to the original ERA5-Land reanalysis data. These achievements highlight the high adaptability of the CATL framework to regions significantly affected by climate change and the increased estimation accuracy it provides.",
