            "description": "The dataset of leaf area index in the middle and lower Heihe River Basin at the north of Qilian Mountains (2001-2015) is stimulated by the Hydrological-Ecological Integrated watershed Flow Model (HEIFLOW). HEIFLOW is a three-dimensional distributed eco-hydrological coupling model, integrating the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the Modular Groundwater Flow Model (MODFLOW) and several ecological modules, which can completely describe the hydrological cycle and vegetation ecological process of the basin. For the modeling details of generating this data, please refer to Han et al. (2021), and for the technical details of HEIFLOW  model, please refer to Han et al. (2021), Tian et al. (2018), and sun et al. (2018)",

This includes integrating surface water and groundwater models with ecological modules to simulate interactions between hydrology and vegetation accurately, as demonstrated in the 2001-2015 data for the Heihe River Basin in the northern Qilian Mountains.",

These components work together to comprehensively describe the watershed water cycle and vegetation ecological processes. The challenges may include ensuring accurate calibration of the model parameters, integrating diverse data sources effectively, and managing the computational complexity associated with the three-dimensional simulations.
