Key parameters are established in a parameter table used as input for inversion. Preprocessed surface reflectance data and land cover data are then inputted, and the LAI product is retrieved using the Look-Up Table (LUT) method.",

By establishing parameter tables for key parameters and using pre-processed surface reflectance and land cover data, the method employs a lookup table (LUT) approach to derive LAI products. This method offers a systematic approach to handling large spatial datasets with consistent temporal and spatial resolution (8 days and 1km respectively) from 2000 to 2012, potentially providing enhanced accuracy and efficiency over other methods that may not integrate such diverse parameters or systematic processing techniques.",

The method involves using pre-processed surface reflectance data and land cover data, which are critical for ensuring reliability.
