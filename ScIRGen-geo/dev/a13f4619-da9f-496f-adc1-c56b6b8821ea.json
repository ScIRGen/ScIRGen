            "description": "This data includes bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence data from 25 lakes in the middle of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The sample was collected from July to August 2015, and the surface water was sampled three times with a 2.5 liter sampler. The samples were immediately taken back to the Ecological Laboratory of the Beijing Qinghai Tibet Plateau Research Institute, and the salinity gradient of the salt lake was 0.14~118.07 g/L. This data is the result of amplification sequencing. Concentrate the lake water to 0.22 at 0.6 atm filtration pressure μ The 16S rRNA gene fragment amplification primers were 515F (5 '- GTGCCAAGCCGCGGTAA-3') and 909r (5 '- GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3'). The Illumina MiSeq PE250 sequencer was used for end-to-end sequencing. The original data was analyzed by Mothur software. The sequence was compared with the Silva128 database and divided into operation classification units (OTUs) with 97% homology. This data can be used to analyze the microbial diversity of lakes in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

Additionally, the remote location and harsh environmental conditions require careful planning for sample collection and transportation to the laboratory. The use of specific sampling techniques, such as using a 2.5-liter sampler for surface water and filtration under 0.6 atm pressure, is crucial to ensure accurate data collection.",
