            "description": "Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) plays an important role in global and regional climate and environment changes. The datasets, including vegetation coverage, biological richness index, net primary productivity, soil salinization, soil erosion, water conservation, and air quality, were selected as the indicators for the eco-environmental quality assessment in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The original data were preprocessed, including outlier testing, projection conversion, and raster resampling, and all data scores were normalized between 1-100. We invite 15 experts in the field of eco-environment to determine the weight of each indicator using the AHP method, perform weighted summation on various layers, and obtain the 1km resolution eco-environment quality dataset for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2000-2020). The dataset includes: (1) EQI data in 2000, 2010, 2020; (2) EQI change data during 2000-2020. The dataset is archived in .tif format with a spatial resolution of 1 km, and consists of four data files with 84 MB (Compressed into one file with 27.6 MB). Research papers based on this dataset are published in Earth's Future.",
