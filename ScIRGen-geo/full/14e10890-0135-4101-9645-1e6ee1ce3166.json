            "description": "The data set describes the hypocentre parameters of shallow-focus earthquakes that occurred in the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau area from 1990 to 2014. Accurate seismic focal depth and focal mechanism solutions can provide an elementary scientific basis for deep Earth deformation and seismogenic structure research. The seismic waveform data are from the IRIS website (http://ds.iris.edu/wilber3/find_event). Teleseismic waveform fitting is used in processing data.\n\nThe focal depth error is ±3 km.\nEarthquake number: earthquake number ID for different areas in chronological order\nOrigin Time: mm/dd/yyyy (month/day/year), hh:mm (hour/minute)\nEarthquake location: longitude, latitude, depth\nEarthquake magnitude: moment magnitude (Mw)\nFocal mechanism solution: trend / inclination / inclination angle (strike / dip / slip)\nError: the least squares method is used to determine the variance between the theoretical waveform and the observed waveform (misfit)\nMoho Depth: Moho",
