            "description": "The dataset of airborne Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometers (PLMR) was acquired on 26 July, 2012, located in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The aircraft took off at 9:10 am (UTC+8) from Zhangye airport and landed at 13:40 pm, with the flight time of 4.5 hours. The flight was performed in the altitude of about 2300 m and at the speed of about 220-250 km during the observation, corresponding to an expected ground resolution of about 700 m. \nThe PLMR instrument flown on a small aircraft operates at 1.413 GHz (L-band), with both H- and V-polarizations at incidence angles of ±7.5°, ±21.5° and ±38.5°. PLMR ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ calibrations were performed before and after each flight. The processed PLMR data include 2 DAT files (v-pol and h-pol separately) and 1 KMZ file for each flying day. The DAT file contains all the TB values together with their corresponding beam ID, incidence angle, location, time stamp (in UTC) and other flight attitude information as per headings. The KMZ file shows the gridded 1-km TB values corrected to 38.5 degrees together with flight lines. Cautions should be taken when using these data, as the RFI contaminations are often higher than expected at v-polarization.",

                    "Answer": "When collecting radiometric data using an L-band airborne microwave radiometer, electromagnetic interference can significantly affect the V polarization TB values, although H polarization is less impacted. To mitigate these challenges, it is important to perform 'hot' and 'cold' radiometric calibration before and after data collection flights. Additionally, assessing and correcting for electromagnetic interference in post-processing can help ensure the accuracy of the data.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection involves using an L-band airborne microwave radiometer at a frequency of 1.4GHz, with vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarization information. The radiometer is mounted on an aircraft flying at approximately 2300m altitude and speeds of 220-250km/hr. The data includes TB values with corresponding scan beam ID, incidence angle, location, time stamp (UTC), and flight attitude information. The radiometer data is corrected for 'hot' and 'cold' radiation calibration at the beginning and end of the flight. Electromagnetic interference is considered, with V polarization TB values being more affected than H polarization. Original data is divided into radiometer data and KMZ files that provide 1km grid TB value distribution at an incidence angle of 38.5 degrees. Additional processing may involve dealing with interference effects in polarization data.",

                    "Answer": "The collection of L-band microwave radiometer data at an altitude of approximately 2300 meters and a speed of 220-250 km/hr is facilitated by airborne technology, specifically using an L-band frequency of 1.4GHz with V and H polarization information. Accurate data collection is supported by performing 'hot' and 'cold' radiometric calibrations before and after flights to account for potential electromagnetic interference, which affects V polarization more strongly than H polarization. The data includes information such as TB values, scan beam ID, incidence angle, position, time stamp (UTC), and other flight attitude details, which are critical for maintaining data accuracy.",
