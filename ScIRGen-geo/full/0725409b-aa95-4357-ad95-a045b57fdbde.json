            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Subalpine shrub eddy covariance system (EC) belonging to the Qinghai Lake basin integrated observatory network from January 1 to October 13 in 2021. The site (100°6'3.62\"E, 37°31'15.67\"N) was located near Dasi, Shaliuhe Town, Gangcha County, Qinghai Province. Data missing due to instrument failure. The elevation is 3495m. The EC was installed at a height of 2.5m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (Gill&Li7500A) was about 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. \nThe released data contained the following variables: DATE/TIME, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). The quality marks of sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and carbon flux are divided into three levels (quality marks 0 have good data quality, 1 have good data quality and 2 have poor data quality). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format.

                    "Answer": "The 'eddy covariance method' refers to a technique used for measuring and calculating vertical turbulent fluxes within the Earth's atmosphere. In the context of hydrometeorological studies, it involves the use of devices like sonic anemometers and gas analyzers to measure wind velocities, temperature, and gas concentrations at high frequencies (e.g., 10Hz). The data are processed to compute fluxes of heat, water vapor, and carbon dioxide over a certain period, such as 30 minutes, using specialized software and methods like coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and virtual temperature correction.",

                    "Answer": "The quality evaluation of flux values, such as atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC), helps infer how well the data represents actual conditions. The division of quality markers into three levels (0 for good quality, 1 for acceptable quality, 2 for poor quality) indicates the reliability of the data in reflecting atmospheric conditions. This assessment provides insights into the consistency and variability of atmospheric processes and the influence of environmental factors on flux measurements.",

However, the completeness of the dataset may be affected by instrument failures, leading to missing data. The software requires data to be filtered, such as removing data with instrument errors or during precipitation events, and excluding datasets with more than 10% missing data in 30-minute intervals. This can result in gaps in the data, which are marked as -6999.",

These measurements help analyze the energy balance, momentum transfer, and gas exchange processes in the subalpine shrub environment, which are crucial for understanding the local climate, ecosystem functions, and their responses to environmental changes.",

Additionally, the data undergo quality evaluation focusing on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data is also screened to exclude erroneous instrument readings, data during precipitation and for an hour after, and any 30-minute interval with more than 10% missing 10Hz raw data. The processed data is then published in 30-minute intervals using Eddypro software.",
