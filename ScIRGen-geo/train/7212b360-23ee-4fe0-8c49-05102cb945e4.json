            "description": "Main contents: the dynamic process of ocean continent subduction not only depends on the properties of subducted oceanic plate, but also depends on the properties and state of overlying continental plate, In particular, little is known about the influence of the thermal state of the continental lithosphere on the subduction dynamics. Using two-dimensional thermal mechanical numerical simulation method, the performance of the continental lithosphere with different thermal states in the ocean continent subduction process is discussed The main results and implications are as follows: (1) when the geothermal gradient of the overlying continental crust is low (10 ~ 15 ℃ km − 1), the oceanic plate begins to subduct at a low angle, and then, driven by its own negative buoyancy, the subduction angle gradually increases and rapidly retreats, forming an ocean basin with a width of 600 ~ 1100km, With the continuous retreat of the trench, the horizontal deviatoric stress in the overlying continental plate alternates between positive and negative, lithospheric thinning mainly occurs near the subduction zone, and the surface has obvious extension and subsidence. (2) when the geothermal gradient of the overlying continental crust is higher (greater than 15 ℃ km − 1), the retreat of the oceanic plate promotes the strong extension of the overlying continental plate, The horizontal deviatoric stress in the overlying continental plate is characterized by compression and then tension, resulting in the surface uplift and then slow subsidence. (3) increasing the age of the oceanic lithosphere will accelerate the retreat process of the trench, (4) the movement of the overlying continental plate towards the trench will slow down the retreat of the trench. When the geothermal gradient of the crust is greater than 17.5 ℃ km − 1, the hot continental crust will collapse and thrust to the subducted oceanic lithosphere, This process will also slow down the retreat of the trench. The spatial changes of the subduction process of the paleo Western Pacific plate in the early Cretaceous and their possible influence on the tectonic evolution of the East Asian basin\nIt is considered that the development of the wide rift basin system in the Amur super terrane in the early Cretaceous is related to the slow retreat of the trench and the collapse of the hot crust; The relatively cold North China Craton lithosphere retreated rapidly due to oceanic trench, resulting in the development of passive rift basins on the continental margin",

                    "Answer": "In the context of numerical simulations of subduction dynamics, the 'continental lithosphere thermal state' refers to the temperature gradient within the continental lithosphere, which affects how the overlying continental plate interacts with the subducting oceanic plate. A lower thermal gradient (10-15℃ km−1) leads to low-angle subduction and ocean basin formation, while a higher gradient (greater than 15℃ km−1) results in strong extensional forces on the continental plate, influencing trench retreat and lithosphere thinning.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods for understanding the thermal state of the overlying continental plate in subduction dynamics may involve numerical simulations that assess the impact of different thermal gradients on the continental lithosphere during ocean-continent subduction. In contrast, methods focusing on the subducting oceanic lithosphere's properties often emphasize its age and buoyancy, which directly influence the subduction angle and trench retreat. While the former might require detailed thermal modeling of the continental crust, the latter may rely more on geophysical data to determine oceanic plate characteristics. The interplay between these two approaches highlights the need for comprehensive models that integrate thermal and mechanical properties from both plates to accurately simulate subduction processes.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in the thermal state of continental lithosphere are influenced by factors such as the geothermal gradient and the age of the oceanic lithosphere. A lower geothermal gradient (10~15℃ km−1) results in low-angle subduction with gradual trench retreat and lithospheric thinning near the subduction zone, while a higher geothermal gradient (>15℃ km−1) causes stronger extension of the overriding continental plate and reduced trench retreat. These variations necessitate different data collection methods to accurately simulate the subduction dynamics, including accounting for changes in stress distribution, lithosphere thickness, and surface deformation in the models.",

                    "Answer": "When a dataset considers variations in the thermal state of the overlying continental lithosphere, potential outcomes may include different subduction angles and rates of trench retreat. A lower geothermal gradient may lead to low-angle subduction followed by rapid trench retreat and decoupling of oceanic and continental plates, causing lithospheric thinning and surface subsidence near the subduction zone. Conversely, a higher geothermal gradient might result in strong extension of the overlying continental plate, reduced trench retreat distance, and changes in surface elevation patterns.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to explore how different thermal states of the continental lithosphere affect the ocean-continent subduction process, as the dynamics of subduction depend not only on the properties of the subducting oceanic plate but also on the nature and state of the overlying continental plate. This includes testing the influence of the continental thermal state, the age of the subducting oceanic slab, and the relative convergence rate on subduction dynamics.",
