      "description": "The 4th China Urban Rural Elderly Population Survey was conducted in August 2015, which was a nationwide cross-sectional survey that included 224142 elderly people aged 60 and above in China. We assessed the incidence of diabetes and related conditions through descriptive analysis and chi square analysis of demographic data, living habits, socio-economic factors and complications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to describe the odds ratio (OR) of the incidence of diabetes in different groups. Stratified analysis based on gender, age, and urban-rural region. All data is collected by trained researchers according to standardized protocols. Each questionnaire has a unique number, start and end time, and the investigator's signature on the cover. Due to the large amount of information collected, we removed unnecessary information such as commuting methods and children's work for our research purposes, while retaining information such as demographic characteristics, health status, social participation, family life, psychology, etc.",
      "descriptionCn": "2015年8月开展了第4次中国城乡老年人口调查，这是一项全国性的横断面调查，纳入了224142例60岁及以上的中国老年人口。我们通过对人口学数据、生活习惯、社会经济因素和合并症进行描述分析和卡方分析来评估糖尿病发生率及相关情况。使用单因素和多因素logistic回归分析描述不同组糖尿病发生率的比值比（OR）。基于性别、年龄和城乡区域进行分层分析。所有数据均由训练有素的研究人员按照标准化方案收集。每张问卷的封面上都有唯一的编号、开始和结束时间，以及调查者的签名。由于收集到的信息量很大，我们根据研究目的删除了不必要的信息，如通勤方式、孩子的工作等，保留了人口特征、健康状况、社会参与、家庭生活、心理等信息。\n结果：最终215041例老年参与者（102692例男性和112349例女性）纳入分析。在中国老年人中自行报告的糖尿病发生率约为8.7%，北京发生率最高（20.8%），新疆发生率最低（0.9%）。Logistic回归分析显示城市（P<0.001）、老年（65-84岁，P<0.001）、女性（P<0.001）、高收入（P<0.001）、睡眠质量差（P=0.01）以及其他因素为糖尿病潜在危险因素。\n结论：这项研究显示了中国老年人的糖尿病发生率和潜在危险因素。同时，这些结果为协助政府进行老年人非传染性疾病的控制提供信息。",

        "A growing aging population in China is one of the key challenges facing public healthcare in the country. In fact, China has already become an aging society. In 2019, there were 164.5 million citizens aged 65 or older, including 26 million aged 80 years or more. It is predicted that the total population will reach 1.40–1.44 billion by 2030 and 1.29–1.40 billion by 2050 according to a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CDC). The proportion of elderly individuals aged 65 years or more was continuously increasing, from 6.96% in 2000 to 8.87% in 2010, and 13.50% in 2020; this age group will comprise 20% of the total population by 2033 and 30% by 2050 from the Fifth Population Census to the Seventh Population Census. Meanwhile, age-related diseases such as diabetes and complications will impose a significant burden on family and public healthcare systems. In 2019, it was estimated that 19.3% of people aged 65–99 years (135.6 million, 95% confidence interval (CI): 107.6–170.6 million) live with diabetes globally. Over the next two decades, the number of people with diabetes will grow from 195.2 million to 276.2 million worldwide. In 2015, diabetes cost US$ 1.31 trillion (95% CI 1.28–1.36), or 1.8% (95% CI 1.8–1.9) of the global economy. China has experienced a dramatic increase in diabetes prevalence, from 2.5% in 1994 to 9.7% in 2008, and to 11.6% in 2010. As of 2019, there are 116.4 million adults in China with diabetes, representing approximately 12.8% of its adult population."

      "challenges": [
        "The limitations of this study may include the following aspects. Firstly, this is a cross-sectional study. And potential risk factor analysis is correlation analysis, not causality analysis. Secondly, we do not test blood sugar to distinguish the hidden diabetes and pre-diabetes, nor do we gather information of the control and treatment of diabetes among the elderly. There are biases from the older persons due to recall bias or cognitive impairment. Thirdly, some variables were not evaluated. The dimensions and number of variables were large, and there was a lack of assessment on presence and change of these modifiable lifestyles, before or after the diagnosis of diabetes."

All data were collected by trained study personnel in accordance with standardized protocols. From a total of 224,142 cases, we excluded those with missing data, including 9,084 cases whose diabetes status was not clear and 17 individuals who had more than 10 missing independent variables. The statistical significance of differences was assessed using Chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a post hoc two-tailed Newman–Keuls test when two or more groups were compared. In univariate logistic regression analysis, demographic data (household registration, age, gender and education level), living habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep quality and exercise), socioeconomic factors (medical insurance, gainful employment, poverty, economic status, public benefit activities, spiritual cultural life), and comorbidities (malignant tumor, cataract/glaucoma, hypertension, CCVD, COPD) were analyzed as independent variables.

        "AnswerEn": "In the context of data collection for elderly populations, 'stratified multistage and probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling method' refers to a sampling technique that involves dividing the population into subgroups, or strata, and then performing multiple stages of selection within each stratum. The probability proportional to size (PPS) aspect means that the probability of selecting a sample is proportional to its size, ensuring that larger strata have a higher chance of being selected. This method is used to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population, considering variations in the size of different strata.",
