In this dataset, there are some basic informations about these sites, such as location, longitude, latitude, altitude, material culture and so on. On this Basis, we identified animal remains, plant macrofossil, selected some samples for radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. This dataset provide important basic data for understanding when and how prehistoric human lived in the Tibetan Plateau during the Paleolithic.",

                    "Answer": "Scientific collection of plant and animal remains during archaeological investigations on the Tibetan Plateau involves systematic gathering, identification, and laboratory analysis of biological materials found at excavation sites. This process yields data such as radiocarbon dating, animal and plant macrofossil identification, charcoal identification, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data, which are crucial for understanding the activities and subsistence strategies of Paleolithic communities.",
