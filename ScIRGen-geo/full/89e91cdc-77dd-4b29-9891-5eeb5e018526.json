            "description": "This data set contains in-situ measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature, and precipitation at 34 stations from a wireless Soil Moisture Network within the ShanDian River basin (referred to as the SMN-SDR hereafter). The coverage of the entire network is about 10,000 km2 (115.5-116.5°E, 41.5-42.5°N). The topography of the SMN-SDR is relatively flat, and land surfaces are typically dominated by grasslands and croplands. A total of 34 stations are set up in the network with three sampling scales including 100 km (large scale), 50 km (medium scale), and 10 km (small scale). The soil moisture sensors used are Decagon 5TM with five measuring depths (3, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm) installed for each station. Of the 34 stations, there are 20 stations equipped with HOBO rain gauges. Undisturbed soil samples at each layer of soil for each station were taken to analyze the gravimetric/volumetric water content, bulk density, and soil texture for further specific calibration. The power supply is provided by solar panels and all data can be transmitted wirelessly to a server. The sampling interval of the data recording time is 10 (before June 2019) or 15 minutes (after June 2019).\nThis network can improve the comprehensive observation capabilities of key water cycle parameters in the ShanDian River basin and provide long-term ground reference data for satellite- and model-based soil moisture products.",
            "instructions": "File naming: The in-situ measurement data set of the SMN-SDR is stored in csv format, and the file name is: \"ShandianRiver_XY_5TM/HOBO_SM/TS/PP_xxcm_YYYY-MM-DD_YYYY-MM-DD.csv\".\nwhere, X represents the sampling scales, usually “L” (100km) or “M” (50km), or “S” (10km); Y stands for site number; 5TM/HOBO stands for sensor type, for example, the sensor for soil moisture and soil temperature data is 5TM, and the sensor for precipitation observation is HOBO; SM/TS/PP represents the type of in-situ data, SM is soil moisture, TS is soil temperature, and PP is precipitation; xxcm represents the detection depth, usually \"03cm\", \"05cm\", \"10cm\", \"20cm\", \"50cm\". Note that when the measurement data is precipitation, xxcm does not display.

                "Soil moisture is a key element of the terrestrial water cycle, controlling various hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes. The acquisition of accurate surface soil moisture data is critical for many applications, including drought monitoring, crop yield estimation, flood prediction, and heat-wave forecasting. Considering the strong spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture, point-scale in situ measurements can only obtain precise information over a very small area. Accordingly, in situ measurements are usually too sparse to specifically describe the spatial-temporal variation of soil moisture over large scales. To meet research and application needs, various global-scale soil moisture products have been developed, which can be roughly divided into the following three major groups: (1) Remotely sensed soil moisture directly retrieved from active/passive satellite microwave observations. Microwave remote sensing, especially passive microwave, has become an effective way to estimate soil moisture at large scales due to its strong sensitivity to soil moisture, as well as the advantages of short-term access and all-weather monitoring. Several satellite platforms carrying passive/active microwave sensors have been successfully operated for the past decades, including (but not limited to) low-frequency passive microwave sensors such as SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), high-frequency passive microwave sensors such as AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2) and Chinese Fengyun series satellites, and active microwave sensors such as ASCAT (the Advanced Scatterometer) and Sentinel-1. Based on the observed passive (brightness temperature, TB) and/or active (backscatter coefficient) microwave signals, these platforms have developed corresponding retrieval algorithms and released soil moisture products to the public. (2) Merged soil moisture products estimated by blending multiple separately released microwave remotely sensed products. The most typical case is the CCI (Climate Change Initiative) project. (3) Model-derived soil moisture, including (but not limited to) NASA’s Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Land Surface Reanalysis v5-Land (ERA5-Land) soil moisture products. There are different retrieval procedures, design accuracy, input datasets, and spatial-temporal resolution between the different soil moisture products, with their accuracy affected by different factors. For instance, the quality of satellite-based soil moisture products is hindered by retrieval algorithms, microwave instrument characteristics, topography, climate, and land cover conditions, while the model structure, input parameters, and atmospheric forcing errors are the main factors for the uncertainty of model-based products. The validation of soil moisture products is commonly based on comparison with reference data, which is assumed to be a good representation of ground truth, aiming to calculate their systematic and random errors and obtain quantitative statistics about the quality of soil moisture products. The random error variance of three collocated datasets can be estimated through triple collocation analysis (TCA), without the need for a single high-quality reference data, which is why TCA has been widely used in soil moisture validation studies. Inter-comparison between soil moisture products and dense in situ measurements (namely fiducial reference data or ground-truth) is currently the primary approach used to assess soil moisture products. Several scientific teams have established dedicated soil moisture networks, including the SMAP core validation sites and monitoring networks in the Tibetan Plateau."

                "This study is the first to use in situ measurements from the SMN-SDR to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of commonly used, multi-source soil moisture products. These results are expected to further promote the improvement of satellite- and model-based soil moisture products."

The quality of satellite-based soil moisture products is hindered by retrieval algorithms, microwave instrument characteristics, topography, climate, and land cover conditions, while the model structure, input parameters, and atmospheric forcing errors are the main factors for the uncertainty of model-based products. The inevitable differences in spatial-temporal scale, and the construction of a dense network which is labor-intensive (e.g. repeated measuring) and costly, are the main challenges for ground-based evaluation. Although this approach is capable of solving scale issues and achieving a global-scale assessment, it can only provide relative conclusions between different soil moisture products, since these non-fiducial reference data may inherently contain unknown biases and uncertainties. The use of TCA requires some basic assumptions, which are often violated."

At each station, five Decagon 5TM sensors were installed in a horizontal orientation at different measuring depths (3, 5, 10, 20, and 50-cm) to measure soil moisture and soil temperature. The nominal accuracy (and resolution) of the 5TM sensor are ± 3% m³/m³ (0.0008 m³/m³) for soil moisture and ± 1 K (0.1 K) for soil temperature. A total of 24 near-surface, coarse-resolution soil moisture datasets were used in this study, including 15 based on single-sensor satellite-based products (seven for L-band low-frequency passive microwave observations, seven for C/X-band higher-frequency passive microwave observations, and one for C-band active microwave observation), six based on multi-sensor merged products, and three based on land surface models."

            "findings": [
                "The results reveal that the latest Climate Change Initiative (CCI) -combined product (v06.1, merging extra low-frequency passive microwave data) had the best agreement with in situ measurements from the SMN-SDR, with the lowest ubRMSE (< 0.04 m³/m³) and highest R (> 0.6). Among all single-sensor retrieved soil moisture products, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products performed best in terms of R (> 0.6) and ubRMSE (close to 0.04 m³/m³), with the SMAP-MDCA (Modified Dual Channel Algorithm) being slightly better than the baseline SCA-V (Single Channel Algorithm-Vertical polarization). Importantly, the newly developed SMAP-IB product, which does not use auxiliary data, delivered the best bias statistics and higher VOD values compared with the drier SMAP retrievals, suggesting that the low VOD values (underestimated vegetation effects) may be the major factor causing the dry bias of SMAP products in this study area. It was also found that TCA may systematically overestimate the correlation and underestimate the ubRMSE of soil moisture products as compared with ground-based metrics. Redundant TCA-based metrics from multiple independent triplets could be averaged to increase the accuracy of final TCA estimates."
