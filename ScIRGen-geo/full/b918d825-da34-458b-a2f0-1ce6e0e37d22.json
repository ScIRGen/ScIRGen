            "description": "The SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data were obtained from the Endeavour space shuttle jointly launched by NASA and NIMA in February 2000. The SRTM system on the Endeavour had been collecting data for 222 hours and 23 minutes. It covered more than 80% of the global land surface from 60° north latitude to 56° south Latitude, including the whole territory of China. The radar image data acquired by the program have been processed for more than two years to form a digital terrain elevation model.\nThe raw data of this data set were downloaded from the SRTM data distribution website (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org). For the convenience of using the data, based on the framing of STRM data, we use Erdas software to splice and prepare the STMR mosaic of the Tibetan Plateau.\nThe accuracy is 30 meters, and the data are in geoTIFF format.\nThe raw data of this data set was downloaded from the SRTM data distribution website (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org).\nThe SRTM data provides a file for each latitude and longitude square. There are two kinds of longitude files, which are 1 arc-second and 3 arc-second, denoted SRTM1 and SRTM3, or 30-m and 90-m data. This data set comprises SRTM3 data with a resolution of 90 m, and the version is SRTM V4.1 (GeoTIFF format).",

The project was a joint endeavor of NASA, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the German and Italian Space Agencies and flew in February 2000. At the foundation of modern geosciences, quite literally, is knowledge of the shape of the Earth’s surface. Conventional topographic mapping technologies have produced maps of uneven quality: some with astounding accuracy, some far less adequate. It has proven exceedingly difficult and expensive to produce a global map set or digital elevation model of consistent scale and resolution by conventional means. The emergence, in the 1990s, of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry placed the possibility of efficiently and affordably creating a global digital elevation model within the grasp of spacefaring nations. Interferometric SAR, or InSAR, makes use of phase-difference measurements derived from two radar images acquired with a very small base to height ratio (typically 0.0002) to measure topography."

The operational goal of C radar was to generate contiguous mapping coverage as called for by the mission objectives. X radar was included as an experimental demonstration. As it did not employ ScanSAR, the X band radar had a slightly higher resolution and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than the C band system. The key to successful acquisition of a data set suitable for automated production is to remove the variability and decorrelation due to pass-to-pass observations and to measure the interferometer baseline and other systematic effects accurately at all times during data acquisition."
