The collection area is located in Zhangye rural demonstration base, Ejina Banner, Jiuquan Satellite Center (2011) and other areas. The main measured vegetation is corn. The Lai value of maize was obtained by using lai2000, and the observation was repeated twice in the mode of one up four down. Cd202 was used to obtain the leaf area of each leaf of maize plant, and three maize plants were collected.",
