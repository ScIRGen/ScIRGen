Similarly, the precision of Re-Os isotope data is also defined by the error analysis values. Both methods involve automated data acquisition by analytical instruments, and the processed data precision remains consistent with the analytical precision.",

                    "Answer": "To obtain zircon U-Pb isotopic age data, LA-(MC)-ICPMS testing is used, while Re-Os isotopic data is gathered using the Re-Os isotopic dilution method with TIMS testing. These methods ensure data precision by using analytical instruments that automatically acquire data, and the age data is calculated using ISOPLOT software.
