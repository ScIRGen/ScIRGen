            "description": "The dataset on ecosystem restoration after grazing exclusion was constructed based on the literature on grassland change. The dataset contains 136 studies, mainly focusing on several regions of China's \"Returning Rangeland to Grassland\" program, including 29 sample sites on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The information collected includes data source, soil type, dominant species, grassland type, location, climate, grazing exclusion years, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, above- and below-ground biomass, soil layer depth, soil bulk density, etc. Some important indicators, such as soil carbon stock, soil nitrogen stock, and above- and below-ground biomass carbon, have been further calculated. The dataset is useful for a deeper understanding of the impacts of grazing exclusion on soil and vegetation biomass. The data were derived from relevant literature covering 2005 to 2021. After careful data integration and cleaning, the credibility and accuracy of the data are guaranteed, and the data quality is excellent. The dataset is of great importance for assessing the effects of grazing exclusion policies on grassland ecosystem restoration. In the future, this dataset can be used for the validation of ecological process models, the formulation of grassland management policies, and the guidance of related ecological environmental protection work, providing scientific support for sustainable grassland management.",

                    "Answer": "To construct a dataset assessing the impact of grazing prohibition on ecosystem recovery, one should start by identifying relevant studies from literature spanning a specified period, such as 2005 to 2021. The selection of study sites should focus on areas impacted by projects like China's 'retire grazing and restore grassland' initiative, ensuring a variety of locations, soil types, and grassland types are covered. Data integration would involve collecting information on data sources, geographical locations, soil types, dominant species, climate data, and grazing prohibition durations. Soil and biomass data collection should include measurements of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, above and below ground biomass, soil surface depth, and bulk density. Subsequent calculations to derive critical indicators such as soil carbon and nitrogen storage and biomass carbon would be necessary. Ensuring data accuracy and reliability requires thorough data cleaning and integration processes.",
