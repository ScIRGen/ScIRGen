            "description": "The dataset is the salinity index (SI) products from 1980s to 2019 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the SI equation which is based on the method that the red band and blue band can well reflect the soil salinity.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.SI is usually used to quantitatively evaluate the salinized soil .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the SI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the SI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SI;the NBR is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the SI results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the SI results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "The metadata suggests that using Landsat satellite data for calculating soil salinity indices is effective because it can utilize the reflectance data from red and blue light bands, which are sensitive to soil salinity. The long-term data from the 1980s to 2019 enables monitoring changes over time. Challenges in ensuring data quality and accuracy include the need for cloud, ice, and snow identification, which are addressed by producing quality assurance files.",

                    "Answer": "The successful calculation of salinity indices from Landsat series satellite data in the Tibetan Plateau region is primarily due to the use of surface reflectance data from the red and blue light bands. These bands are effective in reflecting soil salinity, allowing for the production of SI products through the square root of the product of these bands. Additionally, the data quality is enhanced by the identification of clouds and ice/snow, which results in the generation of quality assurance files.",

This method leverages the principle that the red and blue bands effectively reflect soil salinity. The process involves using these bands from the long-term series data of Landsat satellites to produce the SI, which can then be used to quantitatively evaluate soil salinization.",
