            "description": "We compiled the Seismotectonic Map and Seismic Hazard Zonation Map of  Pan-Third Pole region using the ArcGIS platform through data collecting and digitization. The seismotectonic map of Pan-Third Pole region related  central, south, west, and southeast Asia around Tibetan Plateau. The seismotectonic map is replenished with tremendous amount published data and depicts the location, character and name  of the seismogenic faults or active faults and the epicenter of earthquakes with M ≥ 5 from 1960 to 2021. The zonation map shows the mean values of peak ground acceleration (PGA) with 10% probability of being exceeded in 50 years. The two maps can not only be used in the research of active faults and seismic risks in Pan-Third Pole, but also will be applied to the seismic safety evaluation for infrastructure construction.  \n",
