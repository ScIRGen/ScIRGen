            "description": "The distribution map of permafrost and ground-ice around the Arctic is the only data map of permafrost compiled by the international permafrost association in collaboration with permafrost research institutes of several countries in 1997. The map describes the distribution and properties of permafrost and subsurface ice conditions in the northern hemisphere (20°N to 90°N). Permafrost was divided into continuous (90-100%), discontinuous (50-90%), sporadic (10-50%), island (<10%) and non-permafrost by continuous division of permafrost scope. The subsurface ice abundance at the top 20 m is divided by the percentage of ice volume (>20%, 10-20%, <10% and 0%). Published ESRI-shape files are based on 1:10 million paper maps (Brown et al. 1997). The map can be used in related research such as global climate change, polar resource development and environmental protection. The China section is shown in thumbnail. See the reference for more information (Heginbottom et al. 1993).\nThe format of the data is the ESRI shapefile, you can download it on the snow and ice data center (http://nsidc.org/data/ggd318.html).",
