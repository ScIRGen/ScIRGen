In the case of Zhangye, the D_Beijing_1954 datum and Krasovsky_1940 spheroid were utilized, indicating a preference for a system that aligns with regional or national mapping standards in China at the time of data collection.",

                    "Answer": "The digitization process involves converting physical charts into digital formats, such as the ESRI Shapefile format, which includes layers like land use, rivers, and roads. This process requires careful editing, compiling, and drawing by a team of specialists, as seen with the contributions of editors and cartographers listed in the metadata. Additionally, projection information must be accurately maintained, including details like Angular Unit, Prime Meridian, and Datum specifications.",
