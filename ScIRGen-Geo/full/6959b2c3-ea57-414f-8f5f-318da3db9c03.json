            "description": "Water scarcity，food crises and ecological deterioration caused by drought disasters are a direct threat to food security and socio-economic development. Improvement of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management is now urgently required. This article describes major scientific and technological progress in the field of drought disaster risk assessment. Drought is a worldwide natural disaster that has long affected agricultural production as well as social and economic activities. Frequent droughts have been observed in the Belt and Road area, in which much of the agricultural land is concentrated in fragile ecological environment. The relative humidity index is the difference between the amount of precipitation in a certain period of time and the potential evapotranspiration over the same period divided by the potential evapotranspiration.",
            "descriptionCn": "在全球变暖的背景下，干旱发生的频率和强度呈增加趋势，由于干旱灾害所引发的水资源匮乏、粮食危机、生态恶化（如荒漠化）等，直接威胁到国家的粮食安全和社会经济发展，干旱灾害风险评估及应急管理的技术水平亟待提高。“一带一路”沿线区域生态环境脆弱、农业耕地集中、干旱灾害频繁，利用遥感卫星监测大区域的干旱水平及其时空变化，对于科学掌握“一带一路”地区的干旱格局、区域分异特征，及其对农业耕地的影响具有重要的科学和现实意义。相对湿润度指数为某时间段的降水量与同时期潜在蒸散量之差除以潜在蒸散量。",
