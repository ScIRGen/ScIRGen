            "description": "Since the first Industrial Revolution, human activity has profoundly affected all spheres of the earth, and this influence will continue to expand and intensify. As an ecosystem unit with global significance, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is also an important ecological security barrier in China, playing a crucial role in soil and water conservation, biodiversity conservation, water conservation and carbon balance. However, in the past 30 years, with the expansion of the scope and rapid growth of the intensity of human activities on the QTP, a series of ecological and environmental issues caused by human activities have become increasingly prominent and seriously affected the ecological functions of the QTP. The comprehensive spatial dataset that records human activity intensity will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intensity and scope of human activities in the region, reveal the law of change of human activities in the context of climate warming, and have important significance for further quantitative identification of the impact of human activities and climate change on the ecosystem, as well as promoting the sustainable development of the region.\nIn this study, the human footprint index method was adopted to evaluate the intensity of human activity on the QTP, which used six types of spatial data as indicators of human activities, including population density, land use, grazing density, night lighting, railway and road. The dataset records indicators of human activity intensity in the seven phases, namely, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017.  The optimization and adjustment of the human footprint method in this dataset mainly include: (1) Six kinds of data including population density, land use, night lighting, grazing density, road and railway were selected to calculate the intensity of human activities; (2) Adjust the assignment of different land use types; (3) The maximum intensity threshold of population density was set at 50 people/km2, and the logarithmic method was used to assign the value. (4) The cattle and sheep density data were used to characterize the grazing density, and the maximum intensity threshold was set as 1000 sheep units/km2, and the logarithmic method was used to assign the value. (5) The corrected DMSP/OLS night lighting data were used for assigning values; (6) Divide the road into five grades, namely expressway, national road, provincial road, county road and other roads, and assign values respectively; (7) The maximum influence range of railway is set as 3.5km; (8) Using glacier and lake spatial data for quality control .\nThe dataset contains the data from \"Duan, Q., & Luo, L. (2020). A dataset of human footprint over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during 1990–2015. China Scientific Data, 5(3). https://doi.org/10.11922/csdata.2019.0082.zh\", and the newly produced data of 2017.\nThis dataset can provide spatial data for exploring the characteristics and rules of spatial changes of human activities in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and can also provide support for exploring the interaction between human activities and ecological environment in the region. it can play a guiding role in promoting the ecological environment protection and sustainable development of the entire Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

Over the past 30 years, as human activities have continuously increased their impact on the ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the preparation of spatial datasets on human activity intensity has become essential for a deeper understanding of the ecological and environmental effects of human activities in the region. Accurate evaluation of human activity intensity is the foundation for exploring the ecological and environmental effects of human activities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and plays an important role in promoting ecological environmental protection and sustainable development in the region. Currently, the evaluation of human activity intensity mainly relies on statistical analysis methods, making it difficult to generate high-quality spatial data on human activity intensity. Compared to the rapid development of research methods, preparation speed, spatio-temporal resolution, and data quality related to climate change research in recent decades, spatial data related to human activities is still in an exploratory development stage. The human footprint index method, as a method for preparing spatial data on human activity intensity, has been applied and developed at various scales globally since it was proposed by Sanderson et al. in 2002."

                "Alpine ecosystems, which account for only 3% of the world’s land area, are fragile and extremely sensitive to global climate change and human activities. Natural and anthropogenic interferences are key to the development of alpine ecosystem spatiotemporal heterogeneity and affect the composition and functioning of alpine ecosystems. Although recent climate change has primarily contributed to alpine environmental change, human activities also exert important impacts. The alpine ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has undergone universal and significant warming in recent decades, and the rate of warming is approximately twice the global average from 1960 to 2009. Temperature and moisture are considered the two key factors driving the formation and development of alpine vegetation. Previous studies have shown that human activities also cause major disturbances to alpine ecosystems. Increasing human activities, such as increases in human population, land cover and land use change, grazing pressure and engineering construction, have profoundly intensified the threats to alpine ecosystems. The central area of the QTP is its most populated area and is a critical engineering and transportation corridor that connects inland China and the QTP. The QTR is considered a landmark project, as it was the first time in history that railway transport from Golmud in Qinghai Province to Lhasa of the Tibet Autonomous Region had been introduced. The QTR has alleviated traffic bottlenecks that hinder the economic and social development of the QTP. The alpine ecosystem in the QTEC is extremely sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. It is therefore critical to determine how the alpine ecosystem of the QTEC responds to the joint influences of climate and human activities. Related research in this area has mainly focused on alpine vegetation responses to climate change, while human activities, especially the influence of the QTR, have seldom been addressed."

To obtain more insights into the ecological effects of the QTR on the alpine ecosystem in the QTEC, the QTR was used as a trigger factor to investigate long-term vegetation responses to climate and human activities in the QTEC."

Although the warmer and wetter climate trend has proven beneficial in enhancing alpine vegetation greenness, the declining trend of alpine vegetation has been stronger in regions with more intensive human pressures, especially in the grazing areas and the tourist areas around Lhasa. These results suggest that the impact of the QTR on alpine vegetation in Tibet is greater than that in Qinghai and that the spatial extent of the indirect impact of the QTR in Tibet is confined to approximately 30 km from the railway."
