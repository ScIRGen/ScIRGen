                "A vegetation map is a thematic map that primarily reflects plant communities and is an important aspect of vegetation ecology research. The classification of vegetation in mapping is influenced by different methods. Depending on the mapping purpose and working methods, vegetation maps are generally divided into two main categories: comprehensive vegetation maps and specialized (or applied) vegetation maps. With the development of 3S technology, remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and other technologies have been widely applied in cartography, significantly improving mapping accuracy. The Heihe River Basin is located in China's northwest arid region and is the second largest inland river in the country. In the Heihe River Basin, some mapping has been conducted based on remote sensing for ecological zoning, land use, and specific vegetation types, but there is still a lack of high-precision vegetation maps for the basin."

Field surveys were conducted using sampling methods to investigate the plant communities in the designated supplementary survey areas, with plot sizes of 20m × 20m for trees, 5m × 5m for shrubs, and 1m × 1m for herbaceous plants. Landsat imagery with a resolution of 15m from 2000 to 2014 for the Heihe River Basin was downloaded, and all downloaded remote sensing images were mosaicked after geometric correction using topographic maps. Ecological hydrological sample strip data and literature data on vegetation distribution were analyzed and organized to obtain the geographic coordinates of plant communities. In ArcGIS 10.0, the plant community information was digitized using these coordinates. Five east-west routes and four north-south routes were selected to cover as many vegetation types in the mapping area as possible and to fill in gaps. The classification standards, legend units, and system of the 1:1,000,000 China Vegetation Map were used, including four units: vegetation type group, vegetation type, community, and sub-community."
