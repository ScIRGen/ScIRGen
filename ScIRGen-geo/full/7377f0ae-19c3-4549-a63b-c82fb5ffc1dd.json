            "description": "This data set contains daily values of main meteorological elements at 8 sites (Naqu, Amdo, Liangdaohe, Kekexili, Luoma, TouerJiu, Tangula and Budongquan) in Tibet Plateau (TP) westerlies and monsoon belt during 2018-2022. The data was obseved by the AWS at sites continuously and statistical averaged or accumulated. The data passed quality control and some error data was marked and described. The data set in combination with other elements can be used to study the climate change and land surface processes in TP, especially in Northern TP of westerly and monsoon zone.",
