There are many parameters involved in soil and vegetation, including conventional soil physical and chemical parameters, vegetation parameters and biomass parameters. The determination method of parameter value includes sampling measurement, literature and other related databases, as well as calculation through related software. As the soil and vegetation database of SWAT model involves comprehensive parameters, most of them can also be used as reference for other ecological and hydrological models driving data besides SWAT model.",
