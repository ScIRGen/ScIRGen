            "description": "This dataset includes geochemical element data of stone artifacts and rock debris from sites in the northeast of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas. This dataset contains the elemental analysis results, rock types, and color descriptions of all samples. Entrusted the Qinghai Tibet Plateau Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences to conduct ICP-MS testing of trace elements. Weigh around 30mg of powder sample according to the requirements of ICP-MS sample pretreatment, and digest the powder sample with HF and HNO3 according to the requirements. ICP-MS testing of trace elements Li, Be, B, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Th, U, Sn, Cs, Ba; The content of rare earth elements La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu. In order to understand the economy of rock debris raw materials and related human interactions in the northeastern part of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas, 5656 stone artifacts from 18 late Paleolithic and early Mesolithic combinations and 1 Bronze Age site were visually identified, and identified through macroscopic rock types Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyzed the rock debris materials in these areas. Perform principal component analysis on the measured element data. The elements used in lydite are Zr, Rb, and Th, while those used in jasper are V, Sc, Rb, and As. We found that at least four types of lydite and three types of jasper rocks were used in these sites.",

                    "Answer": "ICP-MS analysis, or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, is a technique used for testing trace elements in samples. In the context of geochemical element data collection, it involves preparing powder samples of about 30mg and digesting them with HF and HNO3 before testing them for trace elements like Li, Be, B, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Th, U, Sn, Cs, Ba, and rare earth elements such as La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu.",

                    "Answer": "ICP-MS, used for geochemical element analysis of stone tool raw materials, provides high precision and low detection limits for microelement and rare earth element content analysis. This method involves detailed sample preparation, including using HF and HNO3 for sample digestion, and allows for a comprehensive analysis of elements like Li, Be, B, and rare earth elements such as La and Ce. Alternative methods may differ in terms of preparation complexity, precision in detecting low concentrations, and the range of elements that can be analyzed effectively.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of geochemical elements for analysis in datasets related to stone tool raw materials from archaeological sites in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas is influenced by the need to identify and differentiate between various rock types that were used as raw materials. Elements like Zr, Rb, Th for basalt and V, Sc, Rb, As for jasper are chosen to perform this differentiation effectively. Additionally, the choice is guided by the availability of analytical techniques like ICP-MS and ICP-OES, which can accurately measure these elements.",
