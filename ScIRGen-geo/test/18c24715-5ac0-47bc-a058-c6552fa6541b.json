            "description": "The dataset is a global surface soil moisture product with a spatial and temporal resolution of 0.25°×0.25°/day, independently developed by Hai-Shen Lǚ's team at Hohai University. The raw data sources are SMOS bright temperature product and SMAP level 4 soil moisture product. The SMOS bright temperature records from 2015-2020 were firstly reconstructed with missing data using the DEINOF method, and then LSTM models were constructed to capture the relationship between bright temperature and SMAP IV products under different bioclimatic partitions (GEnS), and then these network models were driven according to the SMOS bright temperature products under different partitions from 2010-2015 to obtain the SMOS bright temperature products based on the LSTM surface soil moisture products, followed by least squares fusion of SMAP level IV products with ASCAT active microwave soil moisture products for 2015-2020, and finally the final study-level surface soil moisture dataset.",

The process includes reconstructing missing SMOS brightness temperature records using the DEINOF method, building LSTM models to capture relationships between brightness temperatures and SMAP products across different bioclimatic zones (GEnS), and driving these models with SMOS brightness temperature data from 2010-2015. The resulting LSTM-based surface soil moisture products are then fused with 2015-2020 SMAP level-four products and ASCAT active microwave soil moisture data using least squares, leading to the final research-grade surface soil moisture dataset.",

This approach allows for the handling of data gaps effectively before applying LSTM models, ensuring a more continuous and reliable dataset. In comparison to other data reconstruction techniques, DEINOF is specifically tailored for datasets with spatio-temporal properties, which might offer advantages in maintaining data integrity and reducing potential biases in soil moisture estimation.",
