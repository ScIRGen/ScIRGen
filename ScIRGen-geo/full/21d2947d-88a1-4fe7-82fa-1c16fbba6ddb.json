            "description": "This project use distributed HEIFLOW Ecological hydrology model (Hydrological - Ecological Integrated watershed - scale FLOW model) of heihe river middle and lower reaches of the eco Hydrological process simulation.The model USES the dynamic land use function, and adopts the land use data of the three phases of 2000, 2007 and 2011 provided by hu xiaoli et al.\nThe space-time range and accuracy of simulation are as follows:\nSimulation period: 2000-2012, of which 2000 is the model warm-up period\nAnalog step size: day by day\nSimulation space range: the middle and lower reaches of heihe river, model area 90589 square kilometers\nSpatial accuracy of the simulation: 1km×1km grid was used on both the surface and underground, and there were 90589 hydrological response units on the surface.Underground is divided into 5 layers, each layer 90589 mobile grid\nThe data set of HEIFLOW model simulation results includes the following variables:\n(1) precipitation (unit: mm/month)\n(2) observed values of main outbound runoff in the upper reaches of heihe river (unit: m3 / s)\n(3) evapotranspiration (unit: mm/month)\n(4) soil infiltration amount (unit: mm/month)\n(5) surface yield flow (unit: mm/month)\n(6) shallow groundwater head (unit: m)\n(7) groundwater evaporation (unit: m3 / month)\n(8) supply of shallow groundwater (unit: m3 / month)\n(9) groundwater exposure (unit: m3 / month)\n(10) river-groundwater exchange (unit: m3 / month)\n(11) simulated river flow value of four hydrological stations of heihe main stream (gaoya, zhengyi gorge, senmaying, langxin mountain) (unit: cubic meter/second)\nThe first two variables above are model-driven data, and the rest are model simulation quantities.The time range of all variables is 2001-2012, and the time scale is month.The spatial distributed data precision is 1km×1km, and the data format is tif.\nIn the above variables, if the negative value is encountered, it represents the groundwater excretion (such as groundwater evaporation, groundwater exposure, groundwater recharge channel, etc.).If groundwater depth is required, the groundwater head data can be subtracted from the surface elevation data of the model. In some areas, the groundwater head may be higher than the surface, indicating the presence of groundwater exposure.\nIn addition, the dataset provides:\nMiddle and downstream model modeling scope (format:.shp)\nSurface elevation of the middle and downstream model (in the format of. Tif)\nAll the above data are in the frame of WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_47N.\nTake heiflow_v1_et_2001m01.tif as an example to illustrate the naming rules of data files:\nHEIFLOW: model name\nV1: data set version 1.0\nET: variable name\n2001M01: January 2000, where M represents month",

This integration allowed for accurate simulation of ecological and hydrological processes over the period 2001-2012.",

This involves using land use data from multiple time periods, such as the years 2000, 2007, and 2011, to accurately simulate and analyze the impact of land use changes on hydrological processes.",

                    "Answer": "Potential inaccuracies or challenges in the simulation of ecological and hydrological processes using distributed models like HEIFLOW can arise from several factors, including the quality and resolution of input data such as land use data, the accuracy of model parameters, the complexity of ecological and hydrological interactions that may not be fully captured by the model, and the spatial and temporal resolution of the model itself. The model uses dynamic land use data with specific temporal snapshots (2000, 2007, 2011), which may not fully capture rapid land use changes. Additionally, any errors in driving data like precipitation and upstream runoff observations can propagate through the simulation, affecting the accuracy of variables like evapotranspiration, soil infiltration, and groundwater interactions.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures involve using dynamic land use data from different years (e.g., 2000, 2007, 2011) to inform ecological hydrological models like HEIFLOW. This allows the model to account for changes in land use over time, which can affect hydrological processes. The model then simulates ecological hydrological processes with a spatial resolution of 1km×1km, ensuring detailed analysis of the river basin's dynamics. These procedures help capture temporal and spatial variations that are critical for accurate simulations.",
