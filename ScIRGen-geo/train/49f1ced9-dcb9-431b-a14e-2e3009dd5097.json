Based on Landsat MSS, TM and ETM remote sensing data, 1: 100,000 Land Use Data of China was compiled within three years by a remote sensing scientific and technological team of 19 research institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was organized by the “Remote Sensing Macroinvestigation and Dynamic Research on the National Resources and Environment\", one of the major application programs in Chinese Academy of Sciences during the \"Eighth Five-year Plan\". This data adopts a hierarchical land cover classification system, which divides the country into 6 first-class categories (cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, urban and rural areas, industrial and mining areas, residential land and unused land) and 31 second-class categories. This is the most accurate land use data product in our country at present. It has already played an important role in national land resources survey, hydrology and ecological research.",

Land-cover change is closely related to the terrestrial surface material cycles and life-support processes, i.e., the interaction between biosphere and atmosphere, biodiversity, biogeochemical cycle and sustainable exploitation of resources. The series of scientific study programs, issued and promoted by IGBP and IHDP in 1995, make the study of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) become one of the hot topics in the global environmental change study. As a developing but booming country, China has formulated a series of policies exerting great influence on the land-use change. In addition, due to varied physical environments and vast land areas, its land-use changes not only influence the social and economic development but also impact the global change accordingly."
