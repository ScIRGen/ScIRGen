            "description": "This dataset includes organic matter data of Wulungu Lake in Xinjiang. The area is a closed terminal lake, fed mainly by meltwater from snow and ice, and today the climate in the area is dominated by westerlies. The collected lake core was divided into samples at 1 cm spacing, freeze-dried and sampled, and tested by Muffle furnace. Take cleaning, drying crucible weighing; Weigh the sample and place it in the crucible. Record the total weight of the sample and crucible. The sample is placed in the Muffle furnace, heated to 550℃ and kept for 2 hours, and the crucible is taken out and cooled in the dryer after cooling to the appropriate temperature. After reaching the constant weight, the percentage of the weight of the burned part to the dry weight of the sample is the burned loss. The burning vector was converted to organic matter content by linear formula. With the superposition of centennial scale changes, the water vapor content has gradually increased since 8000 cal BP. 8000 ~ 5350 cal yr BP forms a permanent lake, the surface of which gradually rises. The humidity increases rapidly between 5350 and 500 cal yr BP, with the wettest climate occurring between 3200 and 500 cal yr BP. After 500 cal yr BP, the lake level drops. The trend of increasing humidity in Holocene indicates that the winter precipitation in northern Xinjiang was on the rise during Holocene.",

The first section was 280 cm in sediment depth and was collected using a self-made piston that was assembled with two rubber plugs (each measuring 60 mm in diameter), four steel plates (each measuring 58 mm in diameter), and a steel pin. The second section was 132 cm in sediment depth and was collected using a UWITEC 60-mm piston. Both sections of core WLG10B were split into two halves: one half was used for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning, and the other half was subsampled at 1-cm intervals and freeze-dried for further investigation. The intact half-core was carefully flattened and then imaged with a line scan camera on an Avaatech XRF core scanner with a resolution of 140 ppcm (350 dpi); it was then covered with Ultralene plastic film (4μm) and analyzed again using the same core scanner. The total organic matter (TOM) content was determined using weight loss-on-ignition measurements at 1-cm intervals. Three samples from different lithological facies and samples from the lakeshore and the Wulungu River were used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD. For grain-size analysis, the sediments were subsampled at 1-cm intervals and pretreated with 10% H2O2 to remove organic matter and then with 10% HCl to remove carbonates. Finally, the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dispersed with 10 ml of 0.05 mol/L (NaPO3)6 on an ultrasonic vibrator for 10 mins. Grain-size distributions (GSDs) between 0.02 μm and 2000 μm were measured using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser grain-size analyzer and assigned to 100 size classes."

From 8000 to 5350 cal yr BP, a permanent lake developed, and the lake level gradually rose. Between 5350 and 500 cal yr BP, the moisture status increased rapidly, with the wettest climate occurring between 3200 and 500 cal yr BP. After 500 cal yr BP, the lake level fell. The trend of increasing Holocene wetness indicates a rising winter precipitation in North Xinjiang during the Holocene. This was due to an increase in upwind vapor concentrations caused by increased evaporation and strength of the westerlies, which were determined by the increasing boreal winter insolation and its latitudinal gradient."

                    "Answer": "The weight loss-on-ignition method involves collecting sediment cores and splitting them into halves. One half is subsampled at 1-cm intervals and freeze-dried. The sample is then weighed before and after being placed in a muffle furnace at 550°C for 2 hours. The weight loss is calculated as a percentage of the dry weight to determine the total organic matter content.",

The intact half-core is carefully flattened and imaged with a line scan camera on an Avaatech XRF core scanner with a resolution of 140 ppcm (350 dpi). It is then covered with Ultralene plastic film (4μm) and analyzed again using the same core scanner to determine the composition.",
