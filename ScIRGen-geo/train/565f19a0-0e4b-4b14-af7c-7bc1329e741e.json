            "description": "The dataset is the Landsat enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products from 2022 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is produced based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the EVI equation which is added background adjusted parameters C1 and C2, and atmospheric adjusted parameter L based on NDVI equation.The depended surface reflectance dataset has taken bidirectional reflectance distribution, the EVI dataset not only eliminates atmospheric effects, but also reduces the differences caused by variations of solar elevation angle,so the EVI dataset has better radiative consistency.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow. Compared with NDVI, EVI has stronger ability to resist atmospheric interference and noise,so it is more suitable for weather conditions with high aerosol content and lush vegetation areas.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the EVI result of each image is stored in a folder including the EVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-EVI\", for example, L8-OLI-131-036-20220326-LSR-BRDF-EVI;the EVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-EVI.TIF\", for example, \"L8-OLI-131-036-20220326-LSR-BRDF-EVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset: the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, ENVI, QGIS and so on, the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become 16-bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be multiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
