By establishing the calibration relationship by fitting the median NPP-VIIRS nighttime light radiance and the DMSP-OLS nighttime light DN values, the DMSP-OLS nighttime light stable data from 1992 to 2013 were calibrated, and the synthesized DMSP-OLS data after 2013 are generated based on NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data.  The spatial resolution is 0.00833 ° (about 1km); Raster data type is GeoTIFF. The grid pixel value is radiance with unit 10 − 9 w ∙ cm − 2 ∙ sr − 1. This data set can be used for the study on human activities in Northern Equatorial Africa and Sahel, such as the analysis of temporal and spatial changes of human activities.",

                "Recently, the northern Equatorial Africa and Sahel region has been a hot spot in global environmental issues. Besides being influenced by climate, such as rainfall variability, the influence of human activities has been critical in determining the impact of recurrent drought spells and in enhancing environmental degradation in the Sahel. Nighttime light remote sensing is a useful technology to capture the temporal and spatial distribution of human activities and has been widely applied in urbanization studies, socio-economic assessments, and natural and humanitarian disasters monitoring. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) acquired a nighttime light data record, spanning from 1992 to 2013, which is the longest available time series of nighttime light data with irreplaceable relevance for multiple applications. Since 2013 the successor of DMSP-OLS is the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) that records nighttime light radiance at unprecedented radiometric resolution and accuracy using a dedicated spectral band with 14-bit radiometric resolution. Compared with DMSP-OLS nighttime light data, the NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data have notably improved in the following aspects: (1) VIIRS has a much finer spatial resolution of 742 m (across full scan) than the 2.7 km (at nadir) of OLS; (2) VIIRS is characterized by a much smaller minimum detectable radiance than OLS; (3) VIIRS has on-board calibration, thus measuring radiance accurately, while OLS does not. (4) VIIRS overcomes the saturation problem, which is evident in OLS data, with a much wider dynamic range. The challenge to construct an extended time series on nighttime light is, therefore, to inter-calibrate the 6-bit OLS data in arbitrary units (DN-s) to the 14-bit very accurate VIIRS radiance."

                "Other studies used daily or monthly DMSP-OLS nighttime light data, which makes it easier to construct a data set of simultaneous observations, but is difficult to obtain. Due to the huge difference in overpass time (9 hours) between the extension data and the original global DMSP-OLS nighttime lights time series, it is difficult to use them to get a consistent DMSP-OLS DN time series. In addition, few studies generated long time series nighttime light radiance data."

We generated a) a time series of calibrated OLS nighttime light radiance data (1992–2013); b) mean annual VIIRS radiance on stable lights at the OLS spatial resolution for 2013–2020; c) synthetic OLS radiance data generated using VIIRS radiance data degraded to match the radiometric specifications of OLS for 2013–2020."

DMSP-OLS measures nighttime light signals with a 6-bit quantization radiometric resolution in arbitrary units, i.e. digital numbers (DNs), at a spatial resolution of 2.7 km (at nadir without geolocation errors), using the panchromatic visible near-infrared (VNIR) band (0.4–1.1 μm).
