            "description": "In various glacial lake outburst floods, the commonly reported disaster impacts include damage to buildings, hydropower projects, farmland, roads, and bridges. We use these indicators to quantify the exposure of glacial lake outburst floods. Except for water and electricity information, all exposed structural features come from the revised and supplemented OpenStreetMap（ https://www.openstreetmap.org/ ）. OpenStreetMap has limited land cover for the entire Qinghai Tibet Plateau. We examined these structures along the simulated 1499 high risk glacial lake outburst flood paths, and found that a large number of buildings, farmland, roads and bridges had not been drawn, especially the villages located in the ravines, such as Xizang, Hindu Kush Mountains and Central Asia, where there were serious gaps. Except for Nepal, the coverage in other regions of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is optimistically estimated to be less than 5%. Therefore, we artificially supplemented the potential exposed structures of the entire Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Considering the uncertainty of the model flood zone boundary, we set a 200 meter buffer zone around the area that may be submerged by glacial lake outburst floods when extracting exposed features from high-precision Maxar Premium images. Finally, we identified a total of 520610 buildings, 1996 square kilometers of farmland, 98630 kilometers of roads, and 6035 bridges within these buffer zones. The reconstructed structural features can accurately reflect the construction level of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau from 2016 to 2020.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of assessing the impact of glacial lake outburst floods on the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas, 'exposure elements' refer to the structures and features that are susceptible to damage from such floods. These include buildings, hydroelectric projects, farmland, roads, and bridges. The dataset quantifies the exposure of these elements downstream of potential flood paths by using indicators that reflect their vulnerability. The exposure elements are identified and supplemented using data from OpenStreetMap and high-resolution Maxar Premium imagery, especially in regions with limited coverage.",

                    "Answer": "The use of high-resolution Maxar Premium imagery allows researchers to manually supplement and verify the data by providing detailed visual information about the landscape. This method helps to identify and map unreported structures such as buildings, roads, and bridges, especially in areas with severe data coverage gaps, like certain regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. By setting a 200-meter buffer around potential flood zones, researchers can accurately document the exposed elements that may not have been captured by existing data sources, thus reflecting the construction levels from 2016 to 2020.",

                    "Answer": "The limited coverage of OpenStreetMap in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions is due to the vast and remote nature of these areas, which results in many buildings, farmland, roads, and bridges not being mapped, particularly in village ravines across regions such as Tibet, the Hindu Kush mountains, and Central Asia. The coverage is particularly low, estimated optimistically at less than 5% outside of Nepal, where coverage is higher. This necessitated manual supplementation of exposure structures across the region.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to quantify the downstream exposure to the impacts of glacial lake outburst floods by using five indicators: damage to buildings, hydropower projects, farmland, roads, and bridges. This helps in understanding the extent of potential damage in these regions and aids in better disaster preparedness and risk management. Due to limited coverage in OpenStreetMap, the dataset is supplemented manually with high-resolution imagery to ensure accurate representation of exposure structures between 2016 and 2020, especially in underrepresented areas like Tibet, the Hindu Kush, and Central Asia.",
