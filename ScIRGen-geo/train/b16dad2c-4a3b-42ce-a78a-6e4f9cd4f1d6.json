            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Hydrometeorological observation network obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Huazhaizi desert steppe station between 22 September, 2012, and 31 December, 2013. The site (100.319° E, 38.765° N) was located on a desert steppe surface in the Huazhaizi, which is near Zhangye city, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1731 m. There are two equipment in the site, and installed by Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAREERI) and Beijing Normal University (BNU), respectively. The installation heights and orientations of BNU were as follows: two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 2.65 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (AV-10T; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.2, -0.6, and -1 m), and soil moisture profile (ML2X; -0.04, -0.2 and -1 m). For the CAREERI installation: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45C; 1, 1.99 and 2.99 m, north), wind speed profile (03102; 0.48, 0.98, 1.99 and 2.99 m, north), wind direction (03302; 4 m, north), air pressure (PTB210; in waterproof box), rain gauge (CTK-15PC; 0.7 m), four-component radiometer (CNR1; 2.5 m, south), soil temperature profile (107; -0.04, -0.1, -0.18, -0.26, -0.34, -0.42 and -0.5 m), and soil moisture profile (ML2X; -0.02, -0.1, -0.18, -0.26, -0.34, -0.42, -0.5, and -0.58 m, 3 duplicates in -0.02 m).\nThe observations included the following: \n(1)\tinfrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_60 cm and Ts_100 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_4 cm, Ms_20 cm and Ms_100 cm) (%).\n(2)\tair temperature and humidity (Ta_1 m, Ta_1.99 m and Ta_2.99 m; RH_1 m, RH_1.99 m and RH_2.99 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_0.48 m, Ws_0.98 m, Ws_1.99 m and Ws_2.99 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_4 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_18 cm, Ts_26 cm, Ts_34 cm, Ts_42 cm and Ts_50 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_2 cm_1, Ms_2 cm_2, Ms_2 cm_3, Ms_10 cm, Ms_18 cm, Ms_26 cm, Ms_34 cm, Ms_42 cm, Ms_50 cm and Ms_58 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The BNU data were averaged over intervals of 10 min, The CAREERI data were averaged over intervals of 30 min. A total of 144 runs per day were recorded in BNU data and 48 records per day in CAREERI data. The BNU data during 30 June, 2013 and 26 July, 2013 were missing during the malfunction of datalogger. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2013-6-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Li et al.

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
