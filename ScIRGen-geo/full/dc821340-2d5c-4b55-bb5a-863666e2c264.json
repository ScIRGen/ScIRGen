            "description": "The samples collected in Geladandong pluton are mainly monzonitic granite, while the rocks collected in Tanggula pass are quartz porphyry. There are some differences in the contents of major elements, trace elements and rare earth elements between the two types of rocks.\nThe samples of biotite quartz syenite porphyry in the south of gangqiqu and biotite syenite in xiertiongna mountain in the north of gangqiqu were collected and analyzed.\nThis data set records the chemical composition and CIPW standard molecules of intrusive rocks exposed in Qiangtang terrane, and the contents of rare earth elements and trace elements. Including Tanggula pass, Geladandong, gangqiqu and maliaoshan.\nIt comes from the field investigation and indoor determination of the scientific research team in this book. It provides basic and reliable data for the study of Petrochemistry in Qiangtang area.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of the Qiangtang terrane, a systematic approach was employed involving field sampling of specific rock types, such as the biotite quartz monzonite porphyry and biotite quartz monzonite. These samples were then subjected to chemical analysis to record their main elements, trace elements, and rare earth elements, providing foundational data for rock chemistry studies in the region.",

                    "Answer": "CIPW standard molecular refers to a method used in geochemical analysis to calculate the normative mineralogy of a rock based on its chemical composition. It helps in understanding the mineral content and characteristics of intrusive rocks by converting the chemical analysis of the rock into a set of standard minerals. This process aids in comparing and classifying rocks even if their actual mineral composition is not directly observable.",

                    "Answer": "The chemical composition and rare earth element content of granitic rocks from the Tangula Pass, identified as quartz porphyry, differ from those in the Galadandong area, primarily consisting of granodiorite. Systematic specimen collection from these locations, followed by detailed rock chemical analysis, highlights the distinctions in primary and trace element characteristics between the two sites, providing a foundational dataset for geochemical studies of the Qiangtang terrane.",
