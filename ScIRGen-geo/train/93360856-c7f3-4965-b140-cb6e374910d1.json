            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements for snow synchronizing with MODIS was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental area on Mar. 19, 2008. Those provide reliable data for retrieval and verification of the snow temperature through airborne and satellite-borne remote sensing approaches.\n     Observation items included:\n     (1)  Snow parameters, such as snow depth by the ruler (five measurements at random each point), the snow surface temperature by the infrared thermometer (several measurements at random), the snow layer temperature by the probe thermometer (10cm as an interval and two times each point), the snow grain size by the handheld microscope (10cm as an interval and three times each point) in BG-B from 12:40-13:00 (BJT) with the satellite overpass on Mar. 19, 2008. 64 points were selected by four groups.\n     (2) Snow density, snow complex permittivity, snow volumetric moisture and snow gravimetric moisture by the Snowfork in BG-A,automatically in coordination with ASD.\n     (3) The snow spectrum by the portable ASD.\n     (4) Snow albedo by the portable radiometer in BG-A.\n     Two files including raw data and preprocessed data were archived.",
