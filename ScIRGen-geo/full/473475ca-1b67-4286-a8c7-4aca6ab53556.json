            "description": "The data in this paper include some major and trace elements, whole rock SR – nd and B-Mo isotopic data of adakitic rocks. The samples were collected from Dexing porphyry deposit in Jiangxi Province, central and eastern China, and Shaxi, Tongshankou and fengshandong porphyry deposits in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The lithology includes granodiorite porphyry and quartz diorite porphyry. B-Mo isotope data were determined by multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC – ICP – MS). Based on the B-Mo isotopic data, combined with the element and Sr Nd isotopic data obtained by predecessors, the genesis of ore bearing adakitic rocks can be defined, and the mineralization mechanism of porphyry can be enlightened.",
