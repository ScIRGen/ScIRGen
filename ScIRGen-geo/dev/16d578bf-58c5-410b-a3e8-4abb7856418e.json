            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) mission was obtained in the Biandukou foci experimental area on May 25, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) the soil temperature in L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6 and L7;\n     (2) roughness measured by the roughness grid board and collected by the digital camera. Files with \"result\" field were processed data, in which the first row was RMS height (cm; one value), the second row was distance (cm), and the third row was correlation function (cm; changed into correlation length when it is 1/e). \n     (3) GPR and TDR data.\n     Five files were included, roughness photos and preprocessed data, the soil temperature, coordinates of quadrates and sampling lines, GPR and microwave radiometer data. All were archived as Excel and .txt files. Those provide reliable ground data for development and validation of soil moisture and freeze/thaw algorithms from active remote sensing approaches.",

The first column shows the root mean square height, which is consistent across data due to surface stability over time. The second column represents distance, and the third column is the correlation function value. The correlation length is determined when the correlation function value equals 1/e, with units in cm. Challenges include poor photo quality due to inexperienced personnel, requiring manual reading of surface profiles at 1cm intervals from photos and writing them into text files. A program then calculates the root mean square height and correlation length for surface roughness.",
