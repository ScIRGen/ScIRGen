            "description": "This dataset is derived from the paper: Deng, W. et al. (2020). Sharp changes in plant diversity and plant-herbivore interactions during the Eocene–Oligocene transition on the southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Global and Planetary Change, 194, 103293. doi:10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103293\nThis data contains herbivore damage patterns on fossil leaves of plant assemblages from the latest Eocene layer and the earliest Oligocene layer in Kajun Village, Markam County, southeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.\nHerbivore damage patterns on fossil leaves are essential to explore the evolution of plant-herbivore interactions under paleoenvironmental changes and to better understand the evolutionary history of terrestrial ecosystems. The Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT) is a period of dramatic paleoclimate changes that significantly impacted global ecosystems, Researchers identified taxonomic composition of the flora, and investigated well-preserved herbivore damage on fossil leaves from two layers(the latest Eocene layer (MK-3, ~34.6 Ma) and the earliest Oligocene layer (MK-1, ~33.4 Ma)) of the Lawula Formation in Markam County, southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), China.\nThe data contains tables of the records of the leaves fossil, the fileds of the tables are as following:\nBasic Code; Database RFID; Family code; Genera code; Species code; Marks; Plant-herbivore; Leaves for damage; FFGs & DTs; Code marks; Hole feeding; Margin feeding; Skeletonization; Surface feeding; Piercing & Sucking; Oviposition; Mining; Galling; Fungal; Incertae Sedis; Boring; Undefined\nThis dataset also contains some figures in the article.",

Researchers classify the damage into various categories, such as hole feeding, margin feeding, skeletonization, surface feeding, piercing & sucking, oviposition, mining, galling, fungal, incertae sedis, boring, and undefined. Each type of damage is marked and recorded using a coding system to facilitate analysis of plant-herbivore interactions and understand the evolution of soil ecosystems during specific geological periods, such as the Eocene-Oligocene transition.",
