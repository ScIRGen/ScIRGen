            "description": "This data is the set of surface dust properties in high mountain and canyon area of Hengduan Mountain, including magnetic data and geochemical data. The analysis of magnetic susceptibility and geochemical elements was completed at the Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University, China. The magnetic susceptibility was measured by Bartington MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter. The geochemical elements were measured by PW2403 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) produced by Philips in the Netherlands. This data provides the characteristics of magnetic susceptibility and geochemical elements of topsoil in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, which plays an important role in understanding the relationship between modern climate factors and magnetic susceptibility of topsoil in the eastern TP, and the source of dust source area, dust transport and atmospheric circulation model in the TP.",
            "instructions": "The data set of surface dust propertiesin high mountain and canyon area of Hengduan Mountain is stored in CSV format. The names of the files are \"magnetic susceptibility of topsoil in the ETP\", \"mean concentrations of trace elements of ETP section\" and \"mean concentrations of major elements of ETP section\". At the same time, the processing results of element data are attached. The data set can be viewed and edited with Excel software in Microsoft office",

Aeolian loess on the TP is a valuable archive for studying the history of dust activities. Identification of TP dust sources will deepen understanding of dust transport and atmospheric circulation patterns and their environmental impacts. However, consensus on the source of TP loess has not been reached, which hinders understanding of dust transport and paleoenvironmental explanations. The eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP) is a typical region of TP loess deposits, where the loess covers a broad area on various geomorphic surfaces, such as river terraces, mountain slopes, and faulted basins. Because the ETP is at the intersection of the Asian monsoon region and is at high altitude, it is very sensitive to climate change and is an important region for the study of dust deposition on the TP and past environmental changes. The broad arid region in Northwest (NW) China and the adjacent interior of Asia produce large amounts of silty material and are one of the largest dust source centers worldwide. These areas have been regarded as important sources of Chinese loess. Recent studies suggested that the dust over the northern TP was mainly transported from the Tarim Basin and the Qaidam Basin."

However, the findings indicate that the dust from these regions was not the main contributing source to the Tibetan Plateau loess, suggesting that the loess is primarily sourced from the Tibetan Plateau interior itself.",

However, complexities such as the broad consistency of elemental characteristics across different regions and the similarity of element contents in surface sediments on the Tibetan Plateau could indicate multiple contributing sources or an internal source, complicating the identification of a single dominant dust source.",

These analyses help in comparing the elemental characteristics of loess deposits with potential source areas. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated by their ability to reveal that the eastern Tibetan Plateau loess is sourced primarily from the TP interior, rather than remote sources such as the Tarim Basin and Qaidam Basin.",
