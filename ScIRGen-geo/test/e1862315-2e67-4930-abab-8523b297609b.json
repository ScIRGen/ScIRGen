            "description": "This data includes the soil microbial composition data in permafrost of different ages in Barrow area of the Arctic. It can be used to explore the response of soil microorganisms to the thawing in permafrost of different ages. This data is generated by high through-put sequencing using the earth microbiome project primers are 515f – 806r. The region amplified is the V4 hypervariable region, and the sequencing platform is Illumina hiseq PE250; This data is used in the articles published in cryosphere, Permafrost thawing exhibits a greater influence on bacterial richness and community structure than permafrost age in Arctic permafrost soils. The Cryosphere, 2020, 14, 3907–3916, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3907-2020https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3907-2020 . This data can also be used for the comparative analysis of soil microorganisms across the three poles.",
            "instructions": "The dataset contains two file types: sequence data (.fastq) and OTU table (.xlsx).\nFile name: the name of the sequence data file is: permafrost age + thaw status+replication ID.read.fq , permafrost age is the age of the perfofrost, including young (< 50 years old), medium (< 300 years old), old (< 3000 years old) and ancient (3000 – 5000 years old); thaw status is the permafrost state, including: permanently frozen, transition and active; replication ID includes 1-4; read is the sequencing direction, including R1 (forward) and R2 (reverse)\nData reading method: the sequence data can be opened by text program (such as Notepad), and the main content is sequencing base quality; the processed OTU table can be opened by MS Excel, and the subject content is OTU table based on 97% sequence identity and species classification information.",
