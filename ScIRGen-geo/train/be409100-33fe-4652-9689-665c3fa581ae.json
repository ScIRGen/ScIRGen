            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of A’rou Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2018. The site (100.464° E, 38.047° N) was located on a cold grassland surface in the Caodaban village, A’rou Town, Qilian County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3033 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45C; 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 25 m, towards north), wind speed profile (010C; 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 25 m, towards north), wind direction profile (020C; 2 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 5 m, towards south), four-component radiometer (CNR4; 5 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 5 m, towards south, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR-LITE; 5 m, towards south, vertically upward), soil heat flux (HFP01SC; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m, 2 m in the south of tower), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (TCAV; -0.02, -0.04 m, 2 m in the south of tower), soil temperature profile (109; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.06, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2, -2.4, -2.8 and -3.2 m, 3 duplicates in -0.04 m and -0.1 m), and soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.06, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2, -2.4, -2.8 and -3.2 m, 3 duplicates in -0.04 m and -0.1 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_1 m, Ta_2 m, Ta_5 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m and Ta_25 m; RH_1 m, RH_2 m, RH_5 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m and RH_25 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_1 m, Ws_2 m, Ws_5 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m and Ws_25 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_2 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (μmol/(s m-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm_1, Ts_4 cm_2, Ts_4 cm_3, Ts_6 cm, Ts_10 cm_1, Ts_10 cm_2, Ts_10 cm_3, Ts_15 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_30 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_60 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, Ts_160 cm, Ts_200 cm, Ts_240 cm, Ts_280 cm and Ts_320 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm_1, Ms_4 cm_2, Ms_4 cm_3, Ms_6 cm, Ms_10 cm_1, Ms_10 cm_2, Ms_10 cm_3, Ms_15 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_30 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_60 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, Ms_160 cm, Ms_200 cm, Ms_240 cm, Ms_280 cm and Ms_320 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The average soil temperature was rejected during February 16 to March 31 and April 15 to May 20 because of broken of the sensor line; Soil heat flux were wrong occasionally during November to December. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018-9-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "The setup involves installing sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed at 1m, 2m, 5m, 10m, 15m, and 25m heights, with a wind direction sensor at 10m, all oriented north. A barometer is placed at 2m, and a tipping bucket rain gauge is mounted on a 28m observation tower. A four-component radiometer is installed at 5m facing south, along with two infrared thermometers also at 5m, oriented vertically downwards, and a photosynthetically active radiation sensor at 5m facing upwards. Soil sensors are buried 2m south of the tower, with soil heat flow plates at 6cm depth, soil temperature sensors from the surface to 320cm depth, and soil moisture sensors at multiple depths, including repeated measurements at 4cm and 10cm. Data quality control involves ensuring complete daily data collection, marking missing data with -6999, removing duplicate records, and excluding data outside physical or instrumental ranges.",

These sensors are installed on observation towers and are complemented by other instruments such as barometers, rain gauges, radiation devices, and soil sensors, which collectively allow for comprehensive environmental monitoring.",
