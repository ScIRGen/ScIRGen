            "description": "Based on the high-quality genomic sequence analysis, the high-quality genome sequences can be obtained. Therefore, through this technology, the project team divides the sequences in the genome sequence sketch into groups that are consistent with the chromosome number of the species, and determines the order and orientation of all sequences in each group. After that, we can combine the reference vines genome, transcriptome assembly sequence (EST sequence), related species and genetic map data The accuracy of grouping and the sequence and direction between sequences were evaluated.",
