            "description": "The Tibetan Plateau (TP), acting as a large elevated land surface and atmospheric heat source during spring and summer, has a substantial impact on regional and global weather and climate. To explore the multi-scale temporal variation in the thermal forcing effect of the TP，The data set of atmospheric heat source/sink in Tibetan Plateau was prepared as a quantitative analysis tool for calculating heat budget of gas column.\nthe atmospheric heat source/sink dataset consists of three variables: surface sensible heat flux SH, latent heat release LH and net radiation flux RC.\nhere we calculated the surface sensible heat and latent heat release based on 6-h routine observations at 80 (32) meteorological stations during the period 1979–2016：air temperature at 1.5 m and surface temperature and wind speed at 10 m  are used to calculate surface sensible heat flux,the latent heat release is estimated precipitation data.The satellite datasets used to calculate the net radiation flux were the Global Energy\nand Water Cycle Experiment surface radiation budget satellite radiation(GEWEX/SRB) and Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy Systems/Energy Balanced And Filled (CERES/EBAF). The monthly shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in GEWEX/SRB and CERES/EBAF were utilized to obtain the net radiation flux for the period 1984–2015 via statistical methods。",

Due to rare observational records and inhomogeneous distribution of meteorological stations over TP, accurately estimating the intensity and change in TP thermal forcing remains a great challenge. In contrast to a cooling trend in other parts of China and the hiatus of climate warming for the global mean since 1998, rapid climate warming still persists over the TP."
