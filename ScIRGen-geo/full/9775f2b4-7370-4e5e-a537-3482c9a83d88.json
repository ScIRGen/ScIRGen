                "The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments has been crucial to study a variety of global land vegetation processes and how they vary in time. Although AVHRR sensors were not originally intended as a climate mission, their early success for vegetation studies was due to a reconfiguration of the instruments to have non-overlapping (“visible”) channel one (0.58–0.68 µm) and (near-infrared) channel two (0.725–1.10 µm) spectral bands. Since spectral vegetation indices are a surrogate for photosynthetic potential, the long record of AVHRR NDVI data has become particularly relevant for continued long-term monitoring of land surface. However, the difficulties in processing AVHRR NDVI data are to properly deal with several limitations of the AVHRR instrument or operation, e.g., vicarious post-launch calibration, atmospheric and cloud correction, and bias correction for the systematic orbital drift during the life of the individual TIROS-N missions. Among-instrument calibration is a prerequisite to observing and documenting the land variability and it is particularly challenging for the AVHRR because, by design, the instrument does not have fully onboard calibration for the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) channels and must rely on external references."

Complicating among-instrument AVHRR inter-calibration of channels one and two is the dual gain introduced in late 2000 on the AVHRR/3 instruments for both these channels. Orbital drift of the NOAA-7 to NOAA-14 satellites carrying AVHRR/2 instruments adds to the challenge since the NOAA satellite overpass times drifted from the nominal 1:30 pm overpass time by as much as 4.5 hours toward evening, creating variable illumination and view angles."

This is necessary because the AVHRR instruments, by design, do not have fully onboard calibration for the visible and near-infrared channels, which requires them to rely on alternative methods to ensure accuracy in capturing vegetation data.",

This drift affects AVHRR data collection by creating variable illumination and view angles, which can influence the consistency and accuracy of the vegetation indices captured over time.",

In contrast, AVHRR/3 instruments introduced a dual gain in late 2000, complicating inter-calibration of the spectral channels, but do not face the same level of orbital drift issues due to the continuation of measurements on different satellite platforms.",
