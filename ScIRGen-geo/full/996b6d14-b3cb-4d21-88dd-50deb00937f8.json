            "description": "This data is the data of automatic weather station (AWS, Campbell company) set up at the top of the mountain in the west slope of Sejila by the comprehensive observation and research station of Southeast Tibet alpine environment of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016. The geographical coordinates are 29.5919 n, 94.6102 e, with an altitude of 4640 m, and the underlying surface is alpine grassland.\nThe data include daily arithmetic mean data of air temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), wind speed (M / s) and air pressure (MB) and daily accumulated value of precipitation. The original data is an average of 30 minutes before October 2018, and an average of 10 minutes after that. The temperature and humidity are measured by hmp155a temperature and humidity probe. The rainfall instrument model is rg3-m, the atmospheric pressure sensor probe is ptb210, and the wind speed sensor is 05103. These probes are 2 m above the ground. In terms of data quality: the obvious abnormal values are eliminated, the battery is damaged due to snow in the first half of 2019, and the data is missing. The missing temperature data is corrected by using the temperature fitting regression of 43900 m at nearby stations, and the data is yellow. Please pay attention when using it; the monitoring of precipitation starts from August 2019. The data station is a high altitude meteorological station in Southeast Tibet, which will be updated from time to time. It can be used by scientific researchers studying ecology, climate, hydrology, glaciers, etc.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in collecting accurate meteorological data in high-altitude regions such as the Tibetan Plateau include harsh weather conditions that can damage equipment, as evidenced by the snow accumulation in early 2019 that damaged batteries and caused data loss. Additionally, the need for regular maintenance and calibration of sensors, such as temperature and humidity probes, rain gauges, and atmospheric pressure sensors, is crucial to ensure data accuracy. Missing data due to equipment failure may require correction using data from nearby stations, which introduces additional complexity.",
