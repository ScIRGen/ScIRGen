The U-Pb isotopic composition of zircon was analyzed by Agilent 7500a ICP-MS instrument and compexpro 102193nm ArF excimer laser source in school of resource and environmental engineering, Hefei University of technology. The laser energy of 80 MJ and repetition rate of 6 Hz are used, and the frequency is 32 μ M spot size and 50 second ablation time. The isotopic ratios of zircons were calculated by ICP msdatacalv. This data can provide data support for future geochemical model analysis of granodiorite (porphyry) in Chizhou area.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable.
