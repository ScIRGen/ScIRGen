                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has an average height of over 4000 m and an area of 2.5 million km² and exerts a profound thermal and dynamic influence on the Asian monsoon and global weather and climate. Due to the low air density and the strong solar radiation, the TP allows more energy from the surface, directly heating the middle troposphere. The exchange between upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) was found over the Tibetan Plateau. As a huge elevated heating source, a rigorous deep convection area, a dynamical pumping and sucking unit, and westerly jet above it, the TP generates an active stratosphere and troposphere exchange (STE) region, forming a short-circuit and pathway for the STE. Due to a lack of high resolution observational data, the structure of the UTLS above the Tibetan Plateau is still insufficiently understood. The occurrence of multiple tropopauses (MT) plays a central role in the structure and features of the tropopause layer which plays a crucial role in the exchange between the troposphere and stratosphere above the TP. Tropopause folds are the key feature and favourable structures for cross-tropopause exchange in the subtropics. The Tibetan Plateau is situated at 28° N–38° N, a region which is significantly influenced by the subtropical jet stream as it moves northward from winter to summer. Due to the high frequency of tropopause folds, stratosphere intrusions should frequently happen over the Plateau."

This study will contribute to characteristics of MT events using the most advanced radiosonde data in this area."

The variation of the stratospheric intrusions and their influence on the vertical ozone distribution need further analyses."

Three sites, Gerze, Litang and Dali, were equipped with a Vaisala DigiCORA III GPS radiosonding system. The radiosondes used were Vaisala RS92 calibrated with local meteorological measurements before releasing. The sounding data contained profiles of temperature, pressure, relative humidity, horizontal wind speed and direction. The radiosonde transmits data to the receiver every 2 s. With an average 5 m s⁻¹ ascending speed, the obtained vertical resolution of the data is about 10 m. The other six sites employed the Chinese meteorological radiosonde system."

The MT frequencies of all the Plateau stations during IOP3 are the lowest compared to the other two periods. This result supports the conclusion of MT occurring in wintertime with a high frequency over the Plateau, which is similar to previous climatological studies."
