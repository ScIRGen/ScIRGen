        "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) strengthens the Asian monsoon circulation on the one hand, but on the other hand it blocks the transportation of warm and humid air from the Indian Ocean to inner Asia, and a downdraft forms on the northern side of the plateau, which contributes to the aridification of inland areas of Asia. The TD is the world’s second-largest shifting sand desert with an area of 3.376 × 10^5 km^2, located in the Tarim basin (TB) of northwest China, which is the hinterland of Eurasia. It has the characteristics of being located far from the sea and exhibiting the driest climate, the rarest vegetation, the most complex dune types, the highest mobility of dunes, the largest proportion of shifting sand areas, the thickest shifting sand layer, and the smallest sand particle size. Its natural features are unique and typical among deserts around the world and aeolian landforms in arid areas. Furthermore, sand and dust weather is common there. Compared to other deserts in the world, the dust aerosols over the TD exhibit a more notable absorptivity. The large amount of dust aerosols in this region affects the local environment and human health, and these aerosols are also transported by high-altitude westerlies to the lower reaches via uplift by the convergence current with the TP topography. This greatly impacts cloud cover and precipitation, surface energy distribution, ice and snow melting in East Asia and even globally, and ecosystem material cycles. It is estimated that the annual emission of dust aerosols in the TD amounts to approximately 187.31 Tg a−1, accounting for approximately 31.0% of that in East Asia, which is an important source area of global dust aerosols."
      ],
      "research objective": [
        "Based on the aforementioned considerations, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive meteorological and environmental observation network over the TD. This observation network could support comprehensive field observation research of the desert meteorology, including studies related to dust storms and their widespread effects, dust emission and transportation, desert land–atmosphere interactions, desert boundary layer structure, remote sensing monitoring, and desert carbon sink in desert areas. More importantly, the establishment of such a network in the TD could enhance the required environmental and meteorological support capabilities serving the scientific and technological needs faced in balancing the development of the social economy and culture in central Asia with sustainable practices."

      "challenges": [
        "The main goal of data quality control is to reduce low-quality observation data as much as possible to obtain real scientific observations. All of the DECON instruments operate in extremely harsh desert environments. Many of these conditions exceed expectations, and the observation instruments are usually pushed to their operating limits. The desert surface exhibits a high fluidity; hence, fine sand particles readily accumulate and erode surfaces. Moreover, the shifting sand changes the measuring positions of the sensors. The extremely low air humidity, intense solar radiation, and high salinity and alkalinity of the sand cause aging, corrosion, and static electricity in the sensors’ electronic components, which affects the measurement results."
