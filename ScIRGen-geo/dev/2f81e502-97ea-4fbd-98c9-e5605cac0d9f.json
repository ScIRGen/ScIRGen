            "description": "This data set is the data set of Lake elements in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai Province, which records the main lake characteristics and water quality sampling and analysis data in detail. There are many lakes in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai Province, which is one of the concentrated distribution areas of lakes in Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The basic characteristics of Lake Development in this area are: large quantity, many types and complex structure. According to preliminary statistics, there are 107 lakes with an area of more than 1km2, with a total area of 3825km2 and a lake degree of about 0.05. The original data of the data set is digitized from the book \"natural environment of Hoh Xil region in Qinghai Province\", which includes 35 main lake characteristic data and 60 lake water chemical analysis data. This data set provides basic data for the study of Hoh Xil area in Qinghai Province, and has reference value for the research in related fields.",
            "instructions": "The data set is divided into two parts, table data and geographical mathematics.\nThe table data is stored in Excel format, including three workbooks, including the list of main lake characteristics, the calculation table of water chemical composition and hydrochemical type, and the list of water trace elements. The main lake characteristics table introduces the longitude and latitude information, altitude, water depth, lake type and lake characteristics of 35 main lakes. The water sample analysis table also records the water sampling information and analysis results in detail.\nThe results are mainly stored in the form of geographic ShapeFile.",
