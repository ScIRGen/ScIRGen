            "description": "SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) is by NASA and the national geospatial intelligence agency (NGA) cooperation to build the global 3 d graphics data project.In February 2000, the SRTM system mounted on the U.S. space shuttle endeavour collected radar image data between latitude 60 ° north and latitude 57 ° south, and acquired radar image data covering more than 80% of the world's land surface.After more than two years of processing, the digital terrain elevation model was made.\nThis data set including the heihe river basin SRTM points picture and Mosaic two kinds of data, and the points of the graph is SRTM version 4 data by the CGIAR - CSI (international centre for tropical agriculture, http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/) treatment, compared with the previous version has greatly improved, including: 1) use a lot of interpolation algorithm, 2) use more auxiliary DEM data to fill the blank spots and blank area, 3) compared with the third version of the data and migration half a yuan.The Mosaic map is obtained by splicing on the basis of sub-map.\nThe sub-charts include srtm_56_04,srtm_56_05,srtm_57_04 and srtm_57_054. The data are 16 bit values representing the elevation value (-/+/32767 m). The maximum positive elevation is 9000 m and the maximum negative elevation is 12,000 m below sea level.Null data is identified by -32767.Divide the file into 24 rows (-60 to 60 degrees) and 72 columns (-180 to 180 degrees) per 5 latitude and longitude squares.",
