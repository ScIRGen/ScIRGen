            "description": "This dataset includes the observation data from 01 Jan. 2020 through 31 Dec. 2020, collected by lysimeters, which are located at 115.788E, 40.349N and 480 m above sea level, near the Huailai Station in East Garden Town, Huailai County, Hebei Province. The land cover around the station was maize crop. \nThe weighable lysimeter was built by UMS GmbH (Germany), with a surface area of 1m2, and a soil column of 1.5 m high. The original data sampling frequency was 1 Hz, and then averaged to 10min for distribution. The precision of the weighing data is 10g (equivalent to 0.01mm). During the crop growth period, a lysimeter is covered by bare soil and another one is covered by planted maize. The soil moisture, temperature and soil water potential sensors are installed both inside and outside of the lysimeter to ensure that the water cycle in the soil column is consistent with that of the field. Different sensors are located at different depths: 5, 50, 100 cm for soil temperature sensors, and 5, 10, 30, 50, 100 cm for soil moisture sensors, and 30 and 140cm for soil water potential sensors (the tensionmeter here can also measure soil temperature at 30, 140 cm). The soil heat flux plates in both lysimeters are buried at 10cm depth.\nThe data processes and quality control according to: 1) ensuring there were 144 data every day, the lost and overrange data were replaced by -6999; 2) deleting the abnormal data due to maintenances; 3) keeping the consistent date and time format (e.g. 2020-01-01 10:30).\nThe distributed data include the following variables: Date-Time, Weight (I.L_1_WAG_L_000(Kg), I.L_2_WAG_L_000(Kg)), Drainage Weight (I.L_1_WAG_D_000(Kg), I.L_2_WAG_D_000(Kg)), Soil Heat Flux (Gs_1_10cm, Gs_2_10cm) (W/m2), Soil Moisture (Ms_1_5cm, Ms_1_10cm, Ms_1_30cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_100cm, Ms_2_5cm, Ms_2_10cm, Ms_2_30cm, Ms_2_50cm, Ms_2_100cm) (%), Soil Temperature (Ts_1_5cm , Ts_1_30cm, Ts_1_50cm, Ts_1_100cm, Ts_1_140cm, Ts_2_5cm , Ts_2_30cm, Ts_2_50cm, Ts_2_100cm, Ts_2_140cm) (C), Soil Water Potential (TS_1_30(hPa), TS_1_140(hPa), TS_2_30(hPa), TS_2_140(hPa)).

The relationship between field evapotranspiration and meteorological factors (net radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed), soil moisture has been studied through multiple regression analysis method. Lysimeter’s representativeness was significantly affected by the growth of the crops within it. As heat can not be exchanged between the soil in lysimeter and the soil outside, the average temperature of the soil in the lysimeter is 9.5% higher than that of the field outside."

It calculates soil evaporation, crop evapotranspiration, rainfall, and leakage during the corn growing season. By combining meteorological factors, it explores the daily and seasonal variation patterns of soil evaporation and crop evapotranspiration. Additionally, it compares and analyzes the observation results of evapotranspiration from the eddy covariance instrument and the evaporation and infiltration instrument to verify the representativeness of the latter. It also preliminarily analyzes the reasons for the differences between the two, providing a reference for future research on agricultural irrigation decision-making and water-saving in agriculture."

            "challenges": [
                "The evaporation and infiltration instrument is a single-point observation tool with a relatively small observation range, thus its spatial representativeness is limited. Therefore, it is essential to verify whether the observation results of the evaporation and infiltration instrument can represent the evapotranspiration values of farmland within the regional scope. Even after energy closure correction, the evapotranspiration measured by the eddy covariance instrument is lower than that of the evaporation and infiltration instrument, which shows an overestimation phenomenon. Strong Xiaoman and others believe that the evaporation and infiltration instrument isolates the water and heat exchange with the surrounding farmland, leading to differences in soil moisture supply and heat exchange within the instrument compared to the surrounding farmland, which may cause the overestimation of evapotranspiration by the evaporation and infiltration instrument."

The experimental area is divided into irrigated land and dry land by the red line shown in the figure. Both irrigated land and dry land are equipped with a 10 m meteorological tower and a 40 m meteorological tower, which are installed with automatic weather stations and eddy covariance instruments. The soil moisture and energy balance systems are installed at the 10 m meteorological tower located in the irrigated land. According to the experimental requirements, one of the two soil moisture instruments remains bare soil for comparison, while the other is planted with corn. To ensure that the growth conditions of corn in the soil moisture instrument are consistent with those of the surrounding farmland corn during the experiment, corn of the variety Zhengdan 958 was planted on one of the soil moisture instruments on May 5, 2012, and May 10, 2013, with the same sowing time, row spacing, and plant spacing as the surrounding farmland. Additionally, regular weeding was conducted in the soil moisture instrument to ensure that the growth of corn inside the instrument was as consistent as possible with that of the surrounding farmland."

The correlativity between evapotranspiration measured by EC and that by lysimeter is very good. The value of lysimeter is 10.5% higher than that of EC.

                    "Answer": "Lysimeter measurements are limited in spatial representativeness due to their single-point observation nature. The surrounding environmental conditions, such as heat and moisture exchange, differ from those within the lysimeter, leading to potential discrepancies in evapotranspiration estimates. This is exacerbated by the isolation of the soil in the lysimeter from the field, affecting heat exchange and resulting in a higher average soil temperature within the lysimeter compared to the field.",

This is due to the lysimeter's isolation from the surrounding soil, which prevents heat and moisture exchange, leading to a higher soil temperature and moisture supply compared to the surrounding field, thus potentially overestimating evapotranspiration.",

Addressing these challenges involves verifying lysimeter data against other measurement systems like eddy covariance and considering the effects of isolation on soil conditions.",

The heat exchange between the soil in the lysimeter and the surrounding area is limited, causing the average temperature inside the lysimeter to be higher. To ensure the data's representativeness, the growth conditions of maize inside the lysimeter should match those of the surrounding fields.",

                    "Answer": "The representativeness of lysimeter data might be limited because it is a single-point observation method with a small observational range. This limitation in spatial representation necessitates verifying whether the lysimeter observations can accurately represent the evapotranspiration values across larger agricultural fields. Additionally, lysimeters isolate soil from surrounding fields, disrupting natural water and heat exchanges, which could lead to overestimated evapotranspiration values as compared to other methods like eddy covariance systems.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in ensuring that lysimeter data reflect surrounding field conditions include maintaining consistent crop growth conditions within the lysimeter and the field, as discrepancies in these conditions can affect the measurements. For instance, heat exchange limitations between the lysimeter soil and external soil can result in higher average soil temperatures inside the lysimeter, which may not accurately reflect conditions in the surrounding fields. Regular maintenance, such as weeding and ensuring similar planting times and spacing, is essential to minimize these discrepancies.",

                    "Answer": "The higher observed evapotranspiration value in lysimeter data compared to the eddy covariance method could be attributed to the isolation of the lysimeter soil from its surroundings, which affects water and heat exchange processes. As a result, the lysimeter may provide a continuous supply of water and heat that is not representative of the natural field conditions, leading to overestimation. The lack of heat exchange with the surrounding soil can also cause the soil temperature inside the lysimeter to be higher, contributing to the increased evapotranspiration measurements.",

Additionally, even after energy balance closure corrections, measurements from eddy covariance instruments tend to be lower than those from lysimeters, indicating a need for cross-verification of results.",
