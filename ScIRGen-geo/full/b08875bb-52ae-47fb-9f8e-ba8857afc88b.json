The nine nodes contain 4cm and 10cm two-layer hydro probe II probes to observe the main variables such as soil moisture, soil temperature, conductivity and complex permittivity; the si-111 infrared temperature probe is set up at 4m height to observe the surface radiation infrared temperature of the underlying surface. The observation time frequency is 5 minutes. This data set can provide spatiotemporal continuous observation data set for remote sensing estimation of key water and heat variables of heterogeneous surface, remote sensing authenticity test, ecological hydrology research, irrigation optimization management and other research.            \nPlease refer to \"2014 middle reaches of Heihe River waternet data document 20141231.

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
