            "description": "The data set mainly includes the major and trace element data of Mesozoic and Cenozoic granitoids and some dykes in the central and western Lhasa massif, as well as leucogranites and some migmatites in the Himalayan massif. This data is mainly used to study the origin of various magmatic rocks related to Neotethys subduction at the convergent plate margin, and to constrain the subduction process; The study of the genesis of various magmatic rocks during the syn collision between India and Eurasia is of great significance to the study of the net growth of continental crust and the genesis of silicon rich continental crust; The study of the genesis of various post collisional magmatic rocks is of great significance to the discussion of the mechanism of post collisional tectonomagmatism and the crust mantle structure; It is of great significance to study the petrogenesis of volcanic rocks in the collision zone and the origin of temporal and spatial variations of enriched components in magma for using petrological evidence to constrain the time limit of Indo Eurasian collision. In addition, the data set also includes the main and trace element data of Menglian batholith granitoids in Menglian Town, Tengchong City, southeast Tibet, the late Triassic granitoids in Yidun terrane in the east of Qinghai Tibet Plateau, the medium basic rocks in Zhegu Town, Shannan City, Cuomei Large Igneous Province, southern Tibet, and the Linzizong volcanic rocks in the east section of Lhasa terrane, which are mainly used to study the origin of large batholiths at the edge of convergent plates and determine the significance of the crustal genetic mechanism of silicon rich continents; The study of the origin of Labanian intermediate rocks in the large igneous province is of great significance to discuss why the large igneous province lacks intermediate rocks; It is of great significance to study the petrogenesis of volcanic rocks in the collision zone and the origin of temporal and spatial variations of enriched components in magma for using petrological evidence to constrain the time limit of Indo Eurasian collision. A total of 469 pieces of major and trace element data were tested, excluding duplicate sample testing. The main and trace elements are tested by XRF and ICP-MS methods respectively, and the testing units are the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and the Analysis and Testing Center of Wuhan Shangpu Analysis Technology Co., Ltd. The data comes from published articles, which are true and reliable. It can be applied to the study of magmatic rock genesis.",
