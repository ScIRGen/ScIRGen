                "Frozen ground is one of the six major components in the cryosphere (Harris et al. 2018) and a unique long-term climate change and geological evolution product (Henry and Smith 2001; Jin et al. 2011). Recently, the permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) considerably degraded in the context of climate warming and increasing anthropogenic activities (Zhao et al. 2004; Ran et al. 2018; Luo et al. 2018a; Qin et al. 2017; Hu et al. 2019), which poses significant influences on the surface energy balance, ecosystem diversity, biogeochemical cycles, hydrology cycles, and greening gas emissions (Frauenfeld et al. 2004; Guo et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2018; Peng et al. 2019; Luo et al. 2018c, 2020; Zhou et al. 2020). Soil freeze depth (SFD) is one of the most important parameters and is an essential indicator of climate change in the cryosphere (Peng et al. 2017), which is vital to both seasonally frozen ground and permafrost. Under climate warming (Ahmed et al. 2020), SFD decreases when the near-surface frozen ground begins to thaw (Frauenfeld et al. 2004; Peng et al. 2017, 2020). Long-term observations of permafrost and SFD are inadequate on the TP, with some exceptions along the Qinghai-Tibet engineering corridor (Wu and Zhang 2008, 2010) and northeastern TP (Luo et al. 2018a, b), at which these observations were aimed at monitoring the stability of engineering projects and the response of eco-environment to climate change (Wu et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2016)."

We aimed at (1) obtaining the spatial and temporal variations of SFD in the UBRB, (2) quantifying climate change and its influence on SFD change over the UBRB, and (3) comparing the results of maximum SFD and frozen ground changes simulated with two respective datasets."

Observations from 11 national meteorological stations over the UBRB and 6 nearby were used to calibrate relevant parameters and evaluate the simulations.

Another monthly air temperature dataset throughout 1900–2017 was extracted from the reanalysis products released by the University of Delaware (UDEL). Daily soil freeze depth was directly measured by thaw tubes at the national meteorological stations across China. Daily air and ground surface temperatures were collected from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). In total, 11 meteorological stations in the UBRB and 6 additional meteorological stations in the adjacent region were selected."

The maximum SFD calculated with the UEA-CRU and the UDEL decreased respectively by about 0.31 m and 0.15 m over the past 116 years. Simulations with both datasets demonstrated that no significant changes of SFD occurred in the past four 30-year periods (i.e., 1901–1930, 1931–1960, 1961–1990, and 1991–2016), while the maximum SFD calculated with the UEA-CRU was smaller than that with the UDEL. All of these features demonstrated a warming trend of frozen ground from 1901 to 2016 in the UBRB."
