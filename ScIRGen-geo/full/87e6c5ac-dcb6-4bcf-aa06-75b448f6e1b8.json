            "description": "The major element test of host rock of luokuidong molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island was completed by Aoshi analytical testing (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd., and the trace element test was completed by the State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The experiment was completed during 2017-2020. In the experiment, fresh, non altered or weakly altered rock samples were selected. After removing the skin, the samples were crushed to 200 mesh without pollution. Lithium metaborate was used to melt the main elements and analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (method code: me-xrf26d). The content range of elements was 0.01% ~ 100%, and the analysis accuracy was better than 5%. Perkin Elmer SCIEX Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used to test trace elements, and the analysis accuracy was better than 5%.\nThis data can provide data support for geochemical model analysis of luokuidong molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island.\nThe above data are published in EI Core Journal of Geoscience, the data are true and reliable, and the data are stored in the form of Excel.",
