            "description": "The dateset of spectral reflectance observations was obtained by ASD Fieldspec FRTM (Boulder, Co, USA, 350nm-2500nm, 3nm for the visible near-infrared band and 10nm for the shortwave infrared band) in the Biandukou foci experimental area from Mar. 7 to 21, 2008. Those provide reliable ground data for objects modelling and background modelling, remote sensing image simulation and scaling.\n     Spectrum of dry and wet soil, the straw, the snow-covered land and the grassland was measured on Mar. 7 and the snow spectrum was measured on Mar. 21. \n     The quadrates of 90m×90m and 450m×450m were compartmentalized into 81 subgrids of 10m×10m and 50m×50m. Based on the resolution of 30m×30m and 150m×150m, the influence of adjacent eight pixels on the center pixel was studied. Section lines of each subgrid were adopted to acquire the pixel spectrum, which were measured more than once for the mean value.\n     The spectrum data were archived in the ASCII format, with the first five rows as the file header and the following two columns as wavelength (nm) and reflectance (percentage) respectively. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro).",

The process includes grid-based spectral measurements to explore sub-pixel spectral spatial variability characteristics and involves setting up measurement points using GPS or measuring ropes. The data collection method also includes pre-measurement preparations like warming up the equipment to stabilize dark current values and recording environmental conditions. Measurements are conducted by walking through the grid and ensuring that the operator and any shadows do not interfere with the spectrometer's field of view. Additionally, reference panels are measured approximately every minute, and results are recorded in ASCII format for further analysis.",

The measurement focuses on analyzing the spectral characteristics of typical ground objects in a remote sensing experiment. The procedure involves setting up test plots, using GPS or measuring ropes to determine measurement points, accounting for dark current, optimizing integration time, and recording environmental conditions. The data is collected in a way that ensures the instrument's field of view is not obstructed by shadows, and measurements are taken approximately every minute with a reference panel to maintain data accuracy.",
