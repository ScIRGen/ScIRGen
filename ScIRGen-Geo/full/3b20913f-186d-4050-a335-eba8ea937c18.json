            "description": "On the basis of previous studies, the petrographic analysis of Panlong Pb Zn deposit was carried out under the electron microscope. Meanwhile, the energy spectrum analysis of scanning electron microscope showed that radial barite was purer than veinlet barite and did not contain Sr isotope. It is considered that radial barite and veinlet barite are products of different stages, and radial barite was formed in the primary sedimentary stage, The veinlet barite was formed in the activation transformation period. Secondly, a series of homogenization temperature and freezing point temperature of fluid inclusions in barite were measured by using hot and cold table analysis of fluid inclusions in barite during primary deposition and activation transformation. Through the analysis of these temperatures, it is found that the average homogenization temperature of barite during primary deposition is 147.2 °， The mean freezing point temperature is - 4.7 °， The average salinity calculated from freezing point temperature is 7.09% NaCl EQV; The average homogenization temperature during the activation period is 138.9 °， The mean freezing point temperature is -7.75 °， The average salinity calculated by freezing point temperature is 10.90% nacleqv. Through comparison with previous studies, it is found that the fluid characteristics of Panlong Pb Zn deposit in primary sedimentary period are very similar to those of SEDEX deposit, and the ore-forming fluid is mainly evaporated seawater; The barite formed during the activation transformation period may be the result of the intrusion of epithermal solution into the transformed ore body or the influence of another late hydrothermal exhalation event after the primary sedimentary mineralization.",
            "descriptionCn": "本研究在前人研究的基础上，在电子显微镜下对盘龙铅锌矿进行了系统的岩相学分析，同时利用扫描电镜能谱分析发现放射状重晶石成分较细脉状重晶石纯净，不含Sr同位素，认为放射状与细脉状重晶石为不同期次的产物，放射状重晶石形成于原生沉积期，而细脉状重晶石形成于活化改造期。其次主要通过对原生沉积期和活化改造期重晶石内的流体包裹体利用冷热台分析，测得重晶石内流体包裹体一系列的均一温度和冰点温度，通过对这些温度分析发现，原生沉积期的均一温度均值为147.2°，冰点温度均值为-4.7°，根据冰点温度推算出的盐度均值为7.09%NaCleqv；活化改造期的均一温度均值为138.9°，冰点温度均值为-7.75°，根据冰点温度推算出的盐度均值为10.90%NaCleqv，通过与前人研究对比分析发现，盘龙铅锌矿原生沉积期流体特征与SEDEX型矿床流体特征十分相似，成矿流体主要是蒸发的海水；活化改造期形成的重晶石可能是原生沉积成矿后，浅成低温热液侵入改造矿体或先存矿体受到了晚期又一次热水喷流事件的影响。",

The primary sedimentary period barite shows a higher average homogenization temperature and lower salinity, resembling evaporated seawater, which aligns with SEDEX-type mineral deposit fluids.

In contrast, the barite from the reactivation period showed a homogenization temperature of 138.9° and a freezing temperature of -7.75°, with a calculated salinity of 10.90% NaCleqv, suggesting that this barite formed due to a later hydrothermal event, possibly involving low-temperature hydrothermal fluids or another thermal event affecting pre-existing mineral deposits.",
