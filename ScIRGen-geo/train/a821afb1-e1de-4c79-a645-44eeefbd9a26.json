Each RNA-seq data is 6G sequencing depth, which can be used to study the effect of high altitude Tibetan population and lowland Han population for gene expression patterns at hypoxic environment.\n2) Data source and processing method: own data, the pair end 150bp sequencing method using Illumina x-ten sequencing platform.\n3) Data quality: 6G data depth, q30 > 90%.\n4) Results and prospects of data application: the data will be used to validate the gene expression pattern of high altitude hypoxia adaptation gene to hypoxia environment at the cell level.",
