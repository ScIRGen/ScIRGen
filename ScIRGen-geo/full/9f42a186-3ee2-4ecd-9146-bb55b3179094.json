            "description": "Global land cover data are key sources of information for understanding the complex interactions between human activities and global change. FROM-GLC (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover) from Tsinghua is the  30 m resolution global land cover maps produced. The  Global land cover data of all 34 key nodes of pan-third pole region are produced through analyse by argis. The classfication system is crop(10), forest(20), grass(30), shrbu(40), wetland(50), water(60), tundra(70), impervious(80), Bareland(90), snow/ice(100), cloud(120). Finally,  This data set serves as the research basis for all remote sensing data and provides baseline data for the project.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of remote sensing data related to global change studies, 'land cover classification system' refers to a framework used to categorize and label different types of surface cover on the Earth, such as forests, grasslands, and water bodies. This classification provides a structured way to interpret and analyze satellite imagery, enabling researchers to assess the impact of human activities and natural changes on the environment. The classification system typically includes categories like farmland, forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, water bodies, tundra, impervious surfaces, bare land, ice and snow, and clouds, which help in understanding the interactions between human activities and global change.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy and quality of land cover data at a ten-meter resolution in key areas of the Third Pole depend on the quality of the FROM-GLC global land cover products. Factors such as the resolution and processing methods used for the FROM-GLC products, the specific characteristics of the 34 key regions within the Third Pole, and the techniques employed to clip and process these regions' vector data can all impact the data collection methods. These aspects are crucial as they form the foundational data for remote sensing research projects in the area.",

This involves applying a first-level classification system that includes categories such as farmland, forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, water bodies, tundra, impervious surfaces, bare land, ice and snow, and clouds.
