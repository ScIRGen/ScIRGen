            "description": "The Tibetan Plateau Subregional Dynamical Downscaling Dataset-Standard Year (TPSDD-Standard) is a high spatial-temporal resolution gridded dataset for the study of land-air exchange processes and lower atmospheric structure over the entire Tibetan Plateau, taking into account the climatic characteristics of each subregion of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the 500 hPa multi-year average of the geopotential height field over the Tibetan Plateau, the year (2014) with the largest pattern correlation coefficient with this geopotential height field is selected as the standard year, which means that it can roughly reflect the multi-year average status of the atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau. The temporal resolution of this data is 1 hour and the spatial resolution is 5 km. Meteorological elements of the dataset include near-surface land-air exchange parameters such as downward/upward long-wave/short-wave radiation fluxes,  sensible heat fluxes, latent heat fluxes, etc. In addition, the 3-dimensional vertical distribution of wind, temperature, humidity, and pressure from the surface to the top of the troposphere is also included. The dataset was independently evaluated by comparing the observed data with the latest ERA5 reanalysis data. The results demonstrate the accuracy and superiority of the dataset, which offers great potential for future climate change studies.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of a specific year like 2014 as a standard year is based on its high spatial correlation with the multi-year average geopotential height field at 500 hPa over the Tibetan Plateau. This allows the year to roughly reflect the long-term average atmospheric conditions in the region. By using a standard year that represents these conditions, the dataset can provide insights into the typical land-atmosphere exchange processes and lower atmospheric structures, thereby offering a foundation for studying long-term climate trends and variability over the plateau.",
