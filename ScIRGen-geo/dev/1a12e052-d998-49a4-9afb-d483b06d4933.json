The production process of this dataset mainly includes : (1) Based on the urbanization level dataset of the World Urbanization Prospects 2018 Revision (1950-2010) and the World Bank (1960-2019),  logistic regression models for different countries are established to calculate the speed of urbanization level. (2) Using the different speed of urbanization in reference countries and regions to further estimate the development trend of urbanization. The dataset is expected to be widely used in future socio-economic development and climate change research. The detailed procedure for generating this dataset can be found in Chen, S., Huang, Q., Muttarak, R., Fang, J., Liu, T., Heng, C., Liu, Z., Zhu, L. (2022).

Among them, \"the SSPscene\" on behalf of the Shared Socialeconomic path.\"XX\" on behalf of the dataset: WB folder is based on the annual historical data from the World Bank, WUP2018 folder is based on the historical urbanization level database from the World Urbanization Prospects. \"SD\" on behalf of uncertainty. For example, ssp1_WB.csv represents the urbanization rate of each country and region in 2015-2100 under the SSP1 scenario calculated based on the World Bank 's historical urbanization rate dataset. The file \"the 100% urbanization level countries and areas_XX \" contains information on countries that achieved 100 % urbanization in 2015. Because these countries have reached 100% urbanization rate in 2015, so there is no further estimate the urbanization rate of the future.

            "challenges": [
                "However, this method contains several issues. First the previous global projections did not develop country-specific models to estimate urbanization level. The estimated values based on such global uniform models may yield inaccurate results when compared to the historical urbanization level. Second, the coefficients in the established model and the identified reference countries for simulating future urbanization level were not updated in an iterative and dynamic fashion. For example, Jiang and O’Neill estimated the future urbanization level by adjusting the speed of urbanization derived from reference countries every 30 years. However, urbanization is dynamic: some countries may change from developing to developed in less than 30 years. Accordingly, the coefficients and reference countries should be updated more frequently. Third, some projections used the logistic fitting model to estimate the urbanization level. Such model assumes that a country’s urbanization level follows an S-shape curve and reaches a saturation stage (usually set to 80%) at which the urbanization level ceases to increase. However, previous studies have found that a country’s urbanization level will continue to increase after reaching the saturation stage, especially in the context of globalization and global change. Dynamically adjusting the saturation value to accurately simulate the changes in urbanization level after the saturation stage is thus a challenge. Fourth, previous studies did not provide a range of uncertainty. In long-term projections, the urbanization level is commonly used as an input in integrated assessment models or coupled earth system models. Therefore, its uncertainty can provide key information for the uncertainty and robustness of the results of these coupled models."

                    "Answer": "Adjusting the saturation value dynamically is challenging because traditional models assume a fixed saturation stage, typically at 80%. However, evidence suggests that urbanization can continue beyond this stage, particularly in the context of globalization. Accurately simulating these changes requires overcoming the assumption of a static saturation point and addressing the variability introduced by global influences.",
