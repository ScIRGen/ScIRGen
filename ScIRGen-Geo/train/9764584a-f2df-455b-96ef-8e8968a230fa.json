      "description": "The “Long-term series of daily global snow depth” was produced using the passive microwave remote sensing data. The temporal range is 1980~2018, and the coverage is the global land. The spatial resolutions is 25,067.53 m and the temporal resolution is daily. A dynamic brightness temperature gradient algorithm was used to derive snow depth. In this algorithm, the spatial and temporal variations of snow characteristics were considered and the spatial and seasonal dynamic relationships between the temperature difference between 18 GHz and 36 GHz and the measured snow depth were established. The long-term sequence of satellite-borne passive microwave brightness temperature data used to derive snow depth came from three sensors (SMMR, SSM/I and SSMI/S), and there is a certain system inconsistency among them. So, the inter-sensor calibration was performed to improve the temporal consistency of these brightness temperature data before snow depth derivation. The accuracy analysis shows that the relative deviation of Eurasia snow depth data is within 30%. The data are stored as a txt file every day, each file is a 1383*586 snow depth matrix, and each snow depth represents a 25,067.53m* 25,067.53m grid. The projection of this data is EASE-Grid, and following is the file header which describes the projection detail.\nFile header:\nncols 1383\nnrows 586\nxllcorner -17334193.54 \nyllcorner -7344787.75 \ncellsize  25,067.53 \nNODATA_value -1",

        "Seasonal snow cover plays an important role in hydrological cycles and climate processes. Snow depth is a significant parameter in climate and hydrologic model simulations. At present, passive microwave remote sensing is the most efficient way to derive snow depth at global and regional scales. The current snow depth or SWE retrieval algorithms have been developed based on the fact that deeper snowpacks have lower microwave brightness temperatures and that the brightness temperature difference (TBD) at 18 GHz and 36 GHz increases with increasing snow depth. But when the snow depth reaches up to a certain threshold, the brightness temperature at 36 GHz begins to increase slowly or keep stable with the increase of snow depth due to the fact that snow depth exceeds the penetration depth of the 36 GHz, resulting in the TBD at 18 GHz and 36 GHz decreases with the increase of snow depth. Therefore, when snow depth is more than this threshold, the lower frequencies (such as 10 GHz and 18 GHz) can be used to retrieve snow depth/SWE."

        "A novel snow depth/water equivalent (SWE) data retrieval algorithm from passive microwave brightness temperature is proposed based on a priori snow characteristics, including the grain size, density, and temperature of the layered snowpack. In this paper, a snow depth/SWE retrieval algorithm of a look-up table was developed based on a priori snow characteristics (stratigraphy, snow grain size, density, snow temperature, and temperature at the snow/soil interface) in Xinjiang, China."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "Static snow depth retrieval algorithms tend to underestimate the snow depth at the beginning of the snow season and overestimate the snow depth at the end of the snow season because the snow characteristics vary with the age of snow cover. The observations of the sparse weather stations are not sufficient for this purpose; therefore, it is important to develop a snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval method from remote sensing data. However, it becomes more difficult to retrieve the snow depth and SWE of a layered snowpack from brightness temperature data because the layered condition is unknown."

        "The snow depth and SWE determined by this new algorithm were validated by snow measurements at thirteen meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China from 2003 to 2010 and compared with existing SWE products from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC), the European Space Agency (ESA), and measurements with a snow course. We used the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data in this study. In this study, we propose a look-up table method to retrieve snow depth and SWE. First, a look-up table between snow properties and passive microwave brightness temperature at AMSR-E frequencies was established using the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks (MEMLS) based on a priori snow characteristics, which come from field measurements and meteorological station data."

        "AnswerEn": "One of the challenges in retrieving snow depth and SWE from remote sensing data is that static algorithms tend to underestimate or overestimate snow depth due to varying snow characteristics with the age of the snow cover. This issue is compounded when the layered condition of the snowpack is unknown, making it difficult to accurately determine snow depth and SWE.",
        "AnswerCn": "从遥感数据中获取雪深和雪水当量（SWE）面临的挑战之一是，静态算法往往由于雪盖的年龄导致雪的特性变化而低估或高估雪深。当雪层的状态未知时，这一问题更加复杂，使得准确确定雪深和SWE变得困难。",

        "AnswerEn": "Validation of snow depth data with measurements from meteorological stations and field measurements is necessary to ensure accuracy. The novel retrieval algorithms for snow depth and SWE need to be compared against actual measurements to determine their bias and root mean squared error. This helps in evaluating the performance of the algorithms and improving them if necessary.",
