            "titleEn": "HiWATER: The multi-scale observation experiment on evapotranspiration over heterogeneous land surfaces  (MUSOEXE-12)-dataset of flux observation matrix（shenshawo desert station) from Jun to Sep, 2012",
            "description": "This dataset contains the automatic weather station (AWS) measurements from Shenshawo sandy desert station in the flux observation matrix from 1 June to 21 September, 2012. The site (100.49330° E, 38.78917° N) was located in a desert surface, which is near Zhangye city, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1594 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity (HMP45AC; 5 m and 10 m, towards north), air pressure (PTB110; 2 m), rain gauge (52203; 10 m), wind speed (03001; 5 m and 10 m, towards north), wind direction (03001; 10 m, towards north), a four-component radiometer (CNR1; 4 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (IRTC3; 4 m,  vertically downward), soil temperature profile (109; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), and soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates, 0.06 m). \nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and Ta_10 m, RH_5 m and RH_10 m) (℃ and %, respectively), air pressure (press, hpa), precipitation (rain, mm), wind speed (Ws_5 m and Ws_10 m, m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m, °), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation; W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IR_2, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3, W/m^2), soil temperature profile (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_60 cm, and Ts_100 cm, ℃), and soil moisture profile (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_60 cm, and Ms_100 cm, %).\n The data processing and quality control steps were as follows. (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min; therefore, there were 144 records per day. The missing data were filled with -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) In this dataset, the time of 0:10 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:10; the data were stored in *.xlsx format. (5) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2016) (for multi-scale observation experiment or sites information), Xu et al. (2013) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "In arid desert environments, data collection methods involve burying soil moisture and temperature sensors at various depths, such as 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm, and 100cm, and placing them 2 meters south of a meteorological tower. These methods may differ from those used in forested or agricultural regions due to variations in soil composition, vegetation cover, and climate, which can affect sensor placement, depth, and the type of sensors used.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in ensuring the accuracy and completeness of meteorological and soil data can include missing data points, redundant records, and outliers that exceed physical or instrumental limits. These can be addressed by ensuring daily data completeness with a specific number of records, marking missing data with placeholders, removing duplicate entries, and filtering out data that fall outside expected ranges. Consistent formatting of date and time is also crucial for maintaining data integrity.",

                    "Answer": "Factors contributing to data inconsistencies or errors during meteorological measurements in desert environments include the harsh and variable weather conditions, which can affect sensor performance and data accuracy. Moreover, the installation and maintenance of sensors, such as ensuring they are correctly oriented and calibrated, play a crucial role. Data processing steps, like removing duplicates, handling missing data, and filtering out physically implausible values, are essential for maintaining data quality.",

                    "Answer": "Atmospheric variables like air temperature and humidity are measured using sensors mounted at different heights (5m and 10m) on an automatic weather station, oriented towards the north. Pressure is measured using a sensor installed at 2m. Data accuracy and consistency are ensured through a process of data quality control, which includes checking for missing data, removing duplicate records, and excluding data that falls outside the physical or instrumental range. The dataset is processed to ensure a uniform date and time format, and missing data are indicated by a specific placeholder (-6999).",
