            "description": "This data is based on the NPP data of Sanjiangyuan from 1988 to 2012, and the trend and turning point of NPP are obtained using SQ-MK test. Based on the differences in trends before and after the transition, six types of NPP change trends were classified (accelerated growth, positive reversal, decelerated growth, negative reversal, decelerated decline, accelerated decline). The SQ-MK method is used to detect monotonic trends and turning points in time series data. It does not assume data distribution, has high computational efficiency, is easy to implement, and can identify changes in direction.This data showcases various trends in grassland NPP from a turning point of view, which can be used to understand the long-term changes in NPP in the Sanjiangyuan grassland and provide reference for evaluating the implementation effect of major projects. This data needs to be analyzed and explained in conjunction with data from other influencing factors.",

Decades ago, climate change and human activities severely degraded the ecosystem in the TRHR. Grassland is the dominant ecosystem type in the TRHR, and it is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and human disturbance. Since the 1970s, the TRHR has experienced continuous vegetation degradation, resulting in biodiversity loss, soil erosion, wetland decline and other ecological problems. To protect and restore the fragile ecosystem, the Chinese government has launched a series of ecological projects. These projects aim to restore the degraded ecological environment through measures such as grazing prohibition, ecological migration, soil improvement and conservation."

In this study, the SQ-MK test was used to detect approximate trend turning points. To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the TNR, RGLGP, and ECRP ecological projects in the TRHR, this study used NPP data from 1988 to 2012. The SQ-MK test and cluster analysis were applied to detect the trend and turning points in NPP to determine their occurrence and nature. The SQ-MK test is used to detect monotonic trends and turning points in time series data. We used the sequential Mann–Kendall trend test (SQ-MK) to identify significant turning points in NPP data series to examine vegetation fluctuations in a short period of time."

The accelerated growth type accounted for the highest proportion among all types of detected turning points. In the ECRP’s window, the positive turns rose rapidly, from 41% in 2005 to 86% in 2008, and it showed the most balanced restoration effects across grasslands. The results of the study can enhance our understanding of the spatio–temporal distribution of the short-term ecological benefits of different ecological projects, thus provide a scientific and timely reference for future planning and adjustment of the conservation and restoration projects."
