            "description": "This dataset includes the emissivity spectrum (8-14 µm) of typical ground objects in Zhangye City, Zhangye airport, desert and farmland at Wuxing experiment area. The data was measured by the BOMEM MR304 FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer).\nA. Objective\nThe objective of the thermal infrared (TIR) spectrum measurement lies in: Radiometric calibration for the airborne TIR sensor, land surface emissivity products validation and collecting typical surface spectrum working as priori knowledge in land surface temperature inversion and ecological and hydrological models.\nB. Instruments and theory\nInstruments:  BOMEM MR304 FTIR, Mikron M340 blackbody, BODACH BDB blackbody, diffused golden plate, Fluke 50-series II thermometer\nMeasurement theory: The target radiance is directly measured by the MR304 FTIR under clear-sky condition while the atmospheric downward radiance is obtained through a diffused golden plate, and emissivity is retrieved by the Iterative Spectrally Smooth Temperature and Emissivity Separation (ISSTES) algorithm\nC. Experiment site and targets\n29-5-2012: Stone bricks, grassland and asphalt, etc at square of Zhangye.\n20-6-2012: Roof of the building in Zhangye, water and sand sample collected from the desert, etc.\n30-6-2012: Cement road at Zhangye airport, desert around the Zhangye airport.\n3-7-2012: Corn leaves, soil and road in the farmland at Wuxing village, Zhangye City.\n4-7-2012: Corn leaves, wheat canopy at Xiaoman town, Zhangye City.\n10-7-2012: Bricks of Runquanhu park, Zhangye City.\n13-7-2012: Corn leaves and other plants at Wuxing village, Zhangye City.\nD. Data processing\nThe original data collected by BOMEM FTIR is firstly calibrated using the calibration data and get the radiance spectrum of the targets and sky (*.rad), then, the radiance data is converted to the easy readably text file (ASCII format).

Factors such as the type of surface being measured (e.g., urban materials, water bodies, desert sand, vegetation) and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) can affect the radiative properties and thus the measurement outcomes. Calibration with blackbody references and the use of diffuse gold plates help standardize measurements, but inherent variability in environmental conditions may still introduce challenges in ensuring consistent data quality across different measurement sites.",

These measurements are processed using radiative transfer equations and high-spectral-resolution temperature and emissivity separation algorithms (ISSTES) to retrieve surface emissivity spectra. This calibration supports the radiative calibration of airborne thermal infrared sensors, validation of emissivity products, and provides prior knowledge for surface temperature inversion and eco-hydrological modeling.",
