            "description": "This dataset contains zircon U-Th Pb analysis data and rare earth element data from the Precambrian Early Paleozoic magmatic and sedimentary rocks of the Lhasa Block in the central Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The data is sourced from the research team led by Zhai Qingguo from the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The paleogeographic reconstruction of continents (or blocks) plays a crucial role in studying and validating the theory of supercontinent cycles. Due to the lack of stable paleontological and sedimentary records, the pre Cambrian paleogeographic reconstruction of ancient land blocks in orogenic belts has always been a difficult scientific problem to solve. This study proposes a new method for paleogeographic reconstruction based on detrital zircon rare earth elements, and further constrains the paleogeographic origin of the Lhasa block on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, promoting further refinement of the global supercontinent reconstruction plan, which is of great significance for studying and verifying the theory of supercontinent cycles. This dataset mainly includes zircon U-Pb analysis data of the Precambrian stratigraphic units in Lhasa and surrounding blocks, as well as zircon trace element data (U-Th Pb and rare earth elements). These data were obtained through LA-ICP-MS multi receiver plasma mass spectrometry, with excellent data quality, and can be used for the study of early formation and evolution of the Tethys in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and paleogeographic reconstruction.",
