            "description": "This dataset contains the ground surface temperature (GST) data of 72 sensors from 39 sites, which were deployed in the southern part of the Headwater Area of the Yellow River (HAYR). The monitoring network of GST was designed to cover various scales: \nI) 800-m elevational transect (4331 to 5085 m a. s. l.) along the National Highway G214 with 19 sites at a spatial resolution of 2-3 km;  \nii) Landscape scale: 8 sites located within 50 square kilometers; \niii) Local scale: 12 sites located within 2 square kilometers, and; \niv) Fine scale: in each site are placed two sensors (plots) at distances ranging from 2 to 16 m.\nThe sensors were placed below four different landcover types (bare ground, alpine meadow, alpine swamp meadow, and alpine steppe) at approximately 5 cm in depth to avoid solar heating. The GST was measured using iButton temperature loggers (DS1922L) with a resolution of 0.0625°C and an accuracy of ±0.5° C (Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., 2019). The record covers one hydrological year from 1 August 2019 to 31 July 2020 in 3 hours resolution. GST data was quality checked and from initially 83 sensors, 11  were excluded from the dataset due to malfunctions or biased data. This dataset complements the sparse observations of GST on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and helps to identify the permafrost thaw patterns and rate of changes at high spatial resolution.",

                "Known as the “roof of the world” or the core of the Third Pole, the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) is the largest and highest plateau in the world due to its complex terrains and an average elevation of 4000 m a.s.l. The QTP is highly sensitive to climate change, and the plateau ecosystems are vulnerable to climate warming because about 55 % of the plateau surface is underlain by seasonally frozen ground (SFG), and 40 % to 46 % by permafrost. In most locations in the world, permafrost monitoring sites have revealed an increasing trend in permafrost temperature. On the QTP, the temperature of permafrost at 6 m in depth increased by 0.43 °C from 1996 to 2006 and at an average rate of 0.02 °C yr −1 from 2006 to 2010. At about half of the permafrost monitoring sites on the QTP, permafrost is warm (> −1 °C), while for about two-thirds of sites permafrost is warmer than −1.5 °C. Earth system models predicted that permafrost thicker than 10 m covers 36 % of the QTP and permafrost will continue to thin at annual rates of up to 21 cm yr−1 under various climate change scenarios. Several models for permafrost distribution have been built and applied for the QTP but with significant across-model differences in model accuracies as compared to in situ observations. However, the borehole networks for permafrost monitoring are sparse on the QTP, which are concentrated solely along the main infrastructure lines; thus, the monitoring results cannot properly validate the permafrost models at diverse spatiotemporal scales. Therefore, the observational networks of ground surface temperature (GST) could represent a solution to better evaluate these models in rugged terrains and at a finer spatial resolution. GST is essential for understanding the surface energy dynamics and flows, water cycles, ecology, ecohydrology, and climate change impacts in the Earth critical zone, especially in cold regions. GST directly impacts the chemical and biological processes of carbon and nitrogen in the soil and establishes the quality of soil resources. GST has been largely used to understand the thermal regimes in the periglacial environment, to understand the hydrothermal and biogeochemical dynamics of the active layer, and to delineate the distribution of SFG and permafrost. GST influences surface water cycles and vegetation growth and can be used as the upper boundary condition for simulating the thermal state of permafrost and active layer thickness. Although GST has been manually measured since the 1950s through the network of the China Meteorological Administration, these earlier measurements were inconsistent with the recent automatic measurements. Furthermore, the manual protocol of historical measurements was highly biased by the presence of snow cover. A high spatial variability of the mean annual GST (MAGST) has been reported in alpine regions due to the large heterogeneity of surface covers, topography, and snow cover conditions. However, few studies compared the variability of MAGST at a small scale, such as 0.5 km2 in the Scandinavian Mountains and Arctic Canada, or distances < 50 m in the Swiss Alps or up to 100 m in southern Norway. Recently, variations in MAGST have also been assessed at small scales on the northeastern QTP, such as 3.5 km2 and at distances from 2 to 16 m and areas of 2 to 50 km 2. Unfortunately, GSTs are still scantly monitored in mountains, while studies have revealed their importance in the cryosphere, ecosystem monitoring, and hazard mitigation. Nevertheless, we lack systematic monitoring of GSTs and an understanding of their fine-scale variability in time and space."

GST was monitored along an 800 m elevational transect, at local and landscape scales (2 and 50 km 2), and at a fine scale at distances of up to 16 m. All sensors were sealed in pouches to enhance their waterproofing and installed at a depth of approximately 5 cm. The measurement period was 1 hydrological year from 1 August 2019 to 31 July 2020, and the temperature was recorded once every 3 h. The raw GST data were processed by adapting the R scripts developed by Way and Lewkowicz (2018) for automated manipulation of data from the iButton loggers. Several statistical parameters were computed to compare the GST from the two plots of each site: the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), the absolute differences in daily GST and MAGST, and the coefficient of determination (R2) from linear regression models. From 11 plots, soil samples were collected for grain size and water content analysis. Samples were weighed before and after being dried at 105 °C for 16 h to determine the water content. The coarse texture represented by gravel (> 2 mm) was quantified by sieving, while the fine texture ( < 2 mm) representing sand, silt, and clay was measured with a Malvern Mastersizer-2000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer."
