            "description": "Based on a recently developed inventory of permafrost presence or absence from 1475 in situ observations, we developed and trained a statistical model and used it to compile a high‐resolution (30 arc‐ seconds) permafrost zonation index (PZI) map. The PZI model captures the high spatial variability of permafrost distribution over the QTP because it considers multi- ple controlling variables, including near‐surface air temperature downscaled from re‐ analysis, snow cover days and vegetation cover derived from remote sensing. Our results showed the new PZI map achieved the best performance compared to avail- able existing PZI and traditional categorical maps. Based on more than 1000 in situ measurements, the Cohen's kappa coefficient and overall classification accuracy were 0.62 and 82.5%, respectively. Excluding glaciers and lakes, the area of permafrost regions over the QTP is approximately 1.54 (1.35–1.66) ×106 km2, or 60.7 (54.5– 65.2)% of the exposed land, while area underlain by permafrost is about 1.17 (0.95–1.35) ×106 km2, or 46 (37.3–53.0)%.",

                "Permafrost is prevalent over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), but mapping its distribution is challenging due to the limited availability of ground‐truth data sets and strong spatial heterogeneity in the region. The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) is the largest and highest plateau in the world with a mean elevation above 4000 m a.s.l. The QTP has the largest extent of permafrost in the low–middle latitudes. Permafrost over the QTP was reported to be sensitive to climate change due, in part, to its high temperatures (normally >−2 °C) and fragile landscape. Its distribution has strong influences on the environment, such as the surface energy balance, hydrological processes, biogeochemical processes, and human systems. Permafrost, a product of cold climates, typically develops beneath the ground surface at depths dependent on site‐specific characteristics such as climate, subsurface water content, and the presence of insulating surface materials. Because of this, permafrost presence or absence is often indiscernible from the surface and its characteristics, such as thermal state or distribution, are spatially heterogeneous. In recent decades, many maps have been produced to estimate permafrost distribution at different scales over the QTP using statistical and (semi‐)physical methods. Applying numerical models to permafrost mapping in mountainous regions is challenging due to the need for high‐resolution meteorological data to drive the model, which is difficult to obtain. Empirical‐statistical models are a simple yet effective approach to estimating permafrost distribution, especially in mountains wherein situ measurements are sparse. Compared with traditional categorical maps, GLMs can estimate permafrost distribution more precisely by introducing continuous permafrost probability indices which range from 0 to 1."

The method developed by Fiddes was used to derive MAAT for areas with hypsometric position smaller than 0.1, corresponding to areas dominated by the upper‐air temperature, such as mountain tops. The method developed by Gao et al. was used for areas with hypsometric position larger than 0.3, corresponding to areas dominated by surface effects. The original SMASCD product with a spatial resolution of 500 m was bi‐linearly interpolated to the unprojected SRTM30 grid. The 16‐day NDVI from MODIS/Terra (MOD13Q1, v006) was used. A 3 arc second (∼ 90 m) DEM was created by spatially averaging the Global Digital Elevation Model version 2 (GDEM2), which has an original resolution of 1 arc second. Subsequently, topographic indices including slope and aspect were calculated for all sites in the inventory using RSAGA. All model fitting and statistical calculations were conducted using the R programming language (version 3.4.3). To assess the performance of the PZI model, we conducted a 10‐fold cross‐validation."
