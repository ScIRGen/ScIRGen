            "description": "This data set mainly includes the whole rock major and trace elements composition of scheelite mineralized granodiorite porphyry from Dongyuan tungsten mine and zhuxiling tungsten mine in southern Anhui Province, the micro temperature measurement results of quartz phenocrysts and fluid inclusions in quartz veins, etc. the geochemical major data are measured by XRF, and the trace elements are measured by ICPMS, with the accuracy of 2% and 5% respectively. The temperature measurement of fluid inclusion is obtained by Linkam micro thermometer. The accuracy of temperature measurement is better than 0.5 ℃ below zero, and better than 1 ℃ above zero. These data are of great significance to explain the diagenetic and metallogenic processes of scheelite deposits, especially the evolution of hydrothermal processes and the accompanying precipitation and metallogenic processes of scheelite deposits. It shows that the alteration and decomposition of plagioclase is the main genetic mechanism of scheelite deposits in this area.",
