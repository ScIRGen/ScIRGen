            "titleEn": "Summer surface air temperature in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Arctic over the past millennium",
            "description": "We utilized 12 datasets covering the period 900–1999 CE, including two summer temperature gridded datasets from the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, two summer temperature series from the Arctic, a summer temperature gridded dataset from the Arctic, six global gridded annual temperature reconstruction datasets, and a last millennium reanalysis dataset with seasonal resolution. We used the optimal information extraction method to reconstruct the summer temperature anomalies in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Arctic over the past millennium (900–1999 CE) with annual resolution. The range of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is 27°N–36°N, 77°E–106°E, and the range of the Arctic is 60°N–90°N. The reconstruction target is the summer (June–August) temperature anomalies (with respect to 1961–1990 CE period) in the instrumental CRUTEM4v dataset. The data can be used to study the mechanism of temperature variability in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Arctic over the past millennium.",
            "instructions": "The data includes 4 Excel tables, \"TP-inst\" and \"Arctic-inst\" are two target temperature data, \"TP-recon\" and \"Arctic-recon\" are two reconstructed temperature data. Variables include Year, reconstruction (Recon), upper and lower uncertainty bounds, and instrumental data (\"TP-inst\" and \"Arctic-inst\").",

                    "Answer": "In the context of reconstructing past climate temperature series, 'optimal signal extraction method' refers to a technique used to derive the most accurate and representative temperature data from multiple sources of past temperature records. This method aims to minimize noise and enhance the true climatic signal, allowing for a reliable reconstruction of historical temperature variations over a specified period, such as the past millennium.",

                    "Answer": "The usage of 12 temperature reconstruction datasets, including regional and global temperature grid reconstructions, implies a methodology that combines diverse data sources to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the temperature variations captured. The optimal signal extraction method suggests an approach focused on isolating the most relevant signals from varied datasets to construct a coherent temperature sequence, particularly for the summer months, and comparing them to historical anomalies based on a reference period (1961-1990 CE). This methodology allows researchers to infer temperature trends and variations in these regions over a millennium.",

                    "Answer": "The selection was based on 12 sets of past millennium temperature data, including temperature reconstruction datasets for the Tibetan Plateau and Arctic regions, grid-based temperature reconstructions, and global temperature reconstructions, which collectively provided a comprehensive basis for reconstructing the summer surface temperature variations with annual resolution from 900–1999 CE. The choice was also influenced by the goal of aligning with CRUTEM4v dataset for observed temperature anomalies from 1961–1990 CE.",

                    "Answer": "Using optimal signal extraction methods to reconstruct past temperature sequences allows for more refined and accurate representations of climate variations over the last millennium in the Tibetan Plateau and Arctic. This approach can enhance our understanding of temperature change patterns and mechanisms over these regions by leveraging multiple datasets, including global temperature grid reconstructions and past millennium reanalysis datasets. The outcomes may include improved climate models and predictions by providing a deeper historical context for temperature fluctuations.",

                    "Answer": "To reconstruct a millennium-long summer temperature series for the Tibetan Plateau and the Arctic, the optimal signal extraction method is utilized. This involves combining 12 different historical temperature datasets, which include two gridded summer temperature reconstruction datasets for the Tibetan Plateau, two Arctic temperature reconstruction series, one Arctic gridded temperature reconstruction series, six global temperature gridded reconstruction datasets, and one millennium-long global reanalysis dataset. The reconstruction targets the anomalies of the June to August average temperatures based on the CRUTEM4v dataset from the 1961–1990 CE period. The selected geographical range for the Tibetan Plateau is (27°N–36°N, 77°E–106°E), and for the Arctic, it is (60°N–90°N). The objective is to accurately reflect the temperature changes and mechanisms over the past millennium in these regions.",
