            "description": "Detailed geochemical analysis of the balustrade basalts has been carried out in this data set, including whole rock major / trace element, Sr nd Pb isotopic analysis, zircon U-Pb dating, Hf isotopic analysis and silicate melt inclusion major / trace element analysis. X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) was used to analyze the main elements, and the data error was less than 5%. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to analyze trace elements in the whole rock, and the error of analysis results was less than 5-10%. The classification and genesis of the basalt can be effectively judged by the characteristics of major and trace elements. The whole rock SR nd Pb isotope was measured by mc-icp-ms. the results include 86Sr / 88Sr, 146nd / 144Nd, 206Pb / 204Pb, 207Pb / 204Pb and 208Pb / 204Pb ratios. SR nd Pb isotope can be used as a good tracer of magma source, which can trace the composition of basalt source. Compared with the whole rock composition, silicate melt inclusions captured by early crystallized minerals can represent the most initial melt composition. In this paper, the composition of single melt inclusion was analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), and the analysis error was less than 5%. From the composition of melt inclusions, it can be judged that the initial melt of basalt is more refractory. Zircon, as a common accessory mineral, has been widely used in U-Pb dating. LA-ICPMS in-situ analysis technique was used to determine the zircon grains in the balustrade basalts. The dating results indicate that the balustrade basalts were formed in the Jurassic period. Zircon in-situ Hf isotope can effectively trace the source of zircon formation. In this paper, high-resolution Nu plasma II MC-ICP-MS is used to analyze zircon Hf isotope. In the process of analysis, 176hf / 177hf ratios of standard zircon (91500) and Penglai zircon are 0.282301 ± 0.000017(2 σ, N = 15) and 0.282915 ± 0.000014 (2 σ,  18), consistent with previous reports. Hf isotopic analysis results show that there are enriched components. Combined with the whole rock element and isotopic composition, it can be concluded that the balustrade alkaline basalt may be formed by partial melting of the overlying lithospheric mantle due to dehydration and metasomatism of subduction slab.",
