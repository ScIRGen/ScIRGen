            "description": "The terrestrial water storage anomalies, which were estimated from the changes of the Earth’s gravity fields detected by the GRACE gravity satellites, integrates changes of each hydrological variable in the vertical direction. It has great significance for water resource management, drought monitoring and land surface water cycle research to integrate GRACE terrestrial water storage anomalies into the land surface model through data assimilation, constraining and improving simulations of hydrological variables. This study develops a terrestrial water storage assimilation system based on the GRACE gravity satellite.  Assimilated terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage data of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau using the numerical simulation and assimilation experiment was generated from August 2014 to July 2017, which realized the effective integration of the vertical hydrological variable's observations with the hydrological components simulated by land surface model.",

                "Soil moisture is one of the most important variables in hydrological, climatological, biological, and ecological processes and plays a crucial role in controlling the exchange of water and heat energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. Due to the spatiotemporal limitations of ground observations and the large uncertainties associated with atmospheric forcing and land surface parameterizations, land data assimilation has become an effective way of synthesizing complementary information from measurements and land surface models (LSMs) into a superior estimate of geophysical fields of interest (e.g., soil moisture). The measurements include microwave brightness temperature (Tb) obtained from satellite sensors. Because of its sensitivity to surface soil moisture, low-frequency Tb has the potential advantage of increasing the coverage of soil moisture measurements. In order to directly assimilate Tb data into an LSM, a radiative transfer model (RTM) is needed as an observation operator that provides a link between the model states and the satellite-observed Tb data. A preliminary evaluation over China demonstrated that this system greatly improved the soil moisture content estimation for the top 10 cm compared to the model simulation without assimilation. It was found, however, that a single observation operator may degrade the final analysis due to its large uncertainties."

Different from previous studies related to land data assimilation, this paper mainly focuses on the impact of the different observation operators (RTMs) on the assimilated soil-water content, and then on the use of the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method of combining forecasts from different models to enhance the assimilation capability of the new system."

The BMA scheme was found to significantly enhance assimilation capability producing the soil moisture analysis, showing the lowest RMSEs and highest correlations with OBS over all areas.
