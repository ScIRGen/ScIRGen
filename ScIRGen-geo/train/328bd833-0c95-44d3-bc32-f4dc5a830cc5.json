            "description": "This data set was acquired by L & K band airborne microwave radiometer on July 8, 2008 in Linze flight area. \nThe frequency of L-band is 1.4GHz, and the backsight is 35 degrees to obtain dual polarization (H and V) information; the frequency of K-band is 18.7ghz, and there is no polarization information. The plane took off from Zhangye airport at 10:00 (Beijing time, the same below) and landed at 13:38. 10: At 23-13:10, the flight altitude was about 1900m and the flight speed was about 230-250km / hr. Among them, 12:21-12:27 low flying Linze reservoir line 1-6 has a relative altitude of 100m and a flight speed of 190km / hr. 12: 56-13:08 low flying desert marking twice (line 1-7, first North to south, then south to North). \nThe original data is divided into two parts: microwave radiometer data and GPS data. The L and K bands of microwave radiometer are non imaging observations. The digital values obtained from the instantaneous observation are recorded in the text file, and the longitude and latitude as well as the aircraft attitude parameters are recorded in the GPS data. When using microwave radiometer to observe data, it is necessary to convert the digital value recorded into the bright temperature value according to the calibration coefficient (the calibration coefficient file is filed with the original observation data). At the same time, through the clock records of microwave radiometer and GPS, we can connect the microwave observation with GPS record and match the geographic coordinate information for the microwave observation. Due to the coarse observation resolution of microwave radiometer, the effects of aircraft yaw, roll and pitch are generally ignored in data processing. According to the target and flight relative altitude (H), after calibration and coordinate matching, the observation information can also be gridded. The resolution (x) of L band and K band is consistent with that of observation footprint. The reference resolution is: L band, x = 0.3H; K band, x = 0.24h. After the above steps, we can get the products that users can use directly.",

The L-band, with its frequency of 1.4GHz and dual polarization (H and V), can provide detailed insight into soil moisture and vegetation structure, while the K-band, with a frequency of 18.7GHz and no polarization, can offer information related to surface temperature and atmospheric conditions.

The microwave radiometer data consists of instantaneous digital values recorded in text files, while the GPS data contains latitude, longitude, and aircraft attitude parameters. Use calibration coefficients to transform the recorded digital values into brightness temperature values; these coefficients are archived together with the original observation data. Next, synchronize the microwave observation with GPS records by matching their respective timestamps, which links the microwave observations to geographic coordinates. Finally, after calibration and coordinate matching, the observation information can be rasterized based on the intended use and flight relative altitude (H).
