            "description": "This dataset includes 6 tree-ring density sequences in the Tianshan Mountains. In this paper, a maximum latewood density (MXD) chronology of Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana) was constructed from the Tien Shan, Central Asia. Correlation analyses indicate that the MXD variations of spruce trees in the Tien Shan are mainly limited by summer temperature variations. The July–August mean temperature was reconstructed for the Tien Shan back to 1615 CE. The temperature reconstruction explained 42.9% of the instrumental variance (1930–2005). This reconstruction successfully captured the past temperature variabilities in the Tien Shan and enabled visualization of the cool climate before 1850s and the climatic warming after the 1850s. Agreement among the temperature series of the Tien Shan and regional temperature records based on MXDs from Eurasia suggested that our reconstruction had good reliability, captured some warm/cold periods, and first principal component of these MXD records showed that there are strong large‐scale temperature forcings in Eurasia. Our study also showed that there is a linkage between temperature changes in Central Asia and the atmospheric circulations of the middle‐high latitude westerly region and the sea surface temperatures of both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.",

                "As one of the largest mountain ranges on the Eurasian continent, Tien Shan stretches some 2,800 km eastward from Tashkent in Uzbekistan, with a mean elevation of greater than 3,500 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Since it is covered by vast glaciers, forests, and grasslands, the Tien Shan mountain range has some significant influences on the ecosystem and climate of Central Asia and provides water, energy, and food for the local people. However, the meteorological records in many areas of the Tien Shan are too sparse to study the different climate patterns in detail. Instrumental climate data only go back a century at best and come from climate stations located at relatively low altitudes, thus providing poor spatio-temporal coverage for climate studies of Central Asia. Therefore, proxy data, like fossil pollens, tree rings, lake sediments, and ice cores, are required to reveal the past climate change over large spatial and long temporal scales. As one of the best high-resolution climate proxy data sources, multiple tree-ring parameters, such as annual ring width, stable isotopes, wood density, and cell structure can be used to reconstruct the history of climatic changes."

                "At the two sites, 94 cores were obtained from 48 trees using 5.1‐mm increment borers in 2006. Following standard dendrochronological techniques (Stokes & Smiley, 1968), all tree‐ring cores of AWL and XBD were mounted in a wooden support, with the tangential surface facing upward and fine sanded to 600 grit (30 microns). A Velmex measuring system at the tree‐ring lab, Institute of Desert Meteorology, China was used to measure annual ring widths (RW) to an accuracy of 0.001 mm. The computer program COFECHA (Holmes, 1983) was employed to assess the cross‐dating quality of the RW series. After completing cross dating of the RW series, the AWL and XBD cores were taken to Switzerland to be processed for X‐ray analysis at the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL studies forest, landscape, biodiversity, natural hazards, and snow and ice. Samples were cut transversely into 1.0‐mm‐thin sections with a twin blade. After placement for 2 hr in a dark room at constant humidity and temperature, photographs of the strips were taken with X‐rays. RW and MXD of the AWL and XBD cores were measured from the photographs using the DENDRO2003 tree‐ring workstation. The MXD series of the five sites were compared to the RW cross‐dating results using the DENDRO2003 tree‐ring workstation. To remove nonclimatic trends and capture more low‐frequency signals, the regional curve standardization method in the computer program CRUST was used in our study (Melvin & Briffa, 2014). After detrending, we combined the MXD series into site chronologies using the arithmetic mean. After putting all original MXD series from the five Tien Shan sites of China and Kyrgyzstan in one file, the original MXD sequences were detrended to construct a composite mean MXD chronology. We also screened the composite MXD chronology in Pearson correlation analysis with the seasonal climate combination from previous July to current September. Based on the results from the climate response analysis, we developed a linear regression equation to reconstruct past temperatures using temperature as the predictand and the MXD index as the predictor. To determine our temperature reconstruction's spatial representation and reveal temperature linkages in different parts of the Eurasian, we calculated spatial correlations of our temperature reconstruction with the CRU gridded temperature data set during the period 1930–2005."

                    "Answer": "Using tree-ring density as a proxy allows for the reconstruction of historical climate data over large spatial and temporal scales, filling in gaps caused by sparse meteorological records. It provides high-resolution climate data that can capture past temperature variabilities and offer insights into historical climate patterns and changes, such as the cool climate before the 1850s and warming after. This method enhances the understanding of large-scale temperature linkages and atmospheric circulations in the region.",

It allows for the development of composite MXD chronologies that capture regional temperature variabilities and large-scale temperature forcings. This integration can lead to more comprehensive reconstructions that correlate well with both regional and Northern Hemisphere temperature records, indicating potential for large-scale climate reconstruction efforts.",

To address these challenges, researchers can utilize proxy data such as fossil pollens, tree rings, lake sediments, and ice cores to reconstruct past climate changes over large spatial and temporal scales. Additionally, expanding the network of high-altitude climate stations and incorporating remote sensing technologies could enhance data reliability and coverage.",
