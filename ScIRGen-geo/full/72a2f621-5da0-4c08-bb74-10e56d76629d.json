            "description": "On 28 August 2012, Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a LiDAR airborne optical remote sensing experiment. Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner  has unlimited numbers of returns intensities measurements including the first, second ,third return intensities. The wavelength of laser light is 1064 nm. The absolute flight altitude is 4800 m with the point cloud density 1.6 point per square meter. Airborne LiDAR-DEM and DSM data production were obtained through parameter calibration, automatic classification of point cloud density and manual editing.",

                    "Answer": "An example of a data collection method used to obtain high-resolution elevation data in a mountainous region is the use of an airborne lidar system. In the Qilian observation area of the upper and middle reaches of the Heihe River, a lidar aerial remote sensing experiment was conducted using a Y-12 aircraft equipped with a Leica ALS70 lidar system. The system operated at a laser wavelength of 1064 nm and captured multiple returns, including the first, second, third, and last echoes. The flight altitude was set at 4800 meters above sea level, with the highest ground point at 3009 meters and the lowest at 2726 meters, resulting in an average point cloud density of 1.6 points per square meter. The data processing involved parameter calibration, automatic point cloud classification, and manual editing to produce DSM and DEM data products.",

DSM represents the earth's surface including all objects on it, while DEM represents the bare ground surface without any objects. These products are formed after processing the point cloud data obtained from lidar, including steps like parameter calibration, point cloud automatic classification, and manual editing.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of the ALS70 LiDAR system and a flight altitude of 4800 meters was likely influenced by the need to obtain high-resolution data with multiple return capabilities (1, 2, 3, and last returns) to effectively capture the topographic and vegetative features of the Qilian observation area. The specific wavelength of 1064 nm and the desired point cloud density of 1.6 points per square meter also played a role in optimizing the data collection for creating detailed DSM and DEM products. Additionally, the flight altitude was chosen to accommodate the varying terrain elevations, with the highest ground point being 3009 meters and the lowest 2726 meters, to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy.",
