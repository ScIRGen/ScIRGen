            "description": "This data set is a geochronological data set of granites in the Hengduan Mountain area, where granites are frequently intrusive and widely distributed, dating from the Precambrian Jinning period to the Cenozoic Himalayan Period.  From east to west, there are four rock belts, namely, kangdian ancient land, Ailaoshan-Jinshajiang, Lincang - Zuogong and Luxi - Tengchong, which are gradually changing from old to new.  The e study on the geological age of granitoids in the above rock belts mainly adopts potassium-argon dilution method and whole-rock rivet-strontium isochron age determination for some rock masses.  The original data of this data set is digitized from the book Granites Geochemistry in Hengduan Mountains. This data set provides data for the study of granite age in Hengduan Mountains and has reference value for the study of related fields.",
            "instructions": "The dataset is stored in Excel format and contains 17 workbooks, which respectively describe the potassium-argon dilution age of granite and rubidium and strontium isotope data of other rocks from different places in the Hengduan Mountains.",

                    "Answer": "The '钾-氩稀释法,' or potassium-argon dilution method, is a technique used in isotopic geochronology to determine the age of granite intrusions. This method involves measuring the ratio of radioactive potassium-40 to argon-40, a stable isotope, to calculate the time elapsed since the rock solidified. It is one of the primary methods used for dating geological formations, providing insights into the timing of granite intrusion activities in regions such as the 横断山区.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using potassium-argon dilution and whole rock Rb-Sr isochron dating are both utilized for studying granite isotopic geological ages. Potassium-argon dilution is commonly used for its ability to date older geological periods, while Rb-Sr isochron dating can provide more detailed information about rock formation and history. Each method may vary in precision and applicability, with potassium-argon often being more suited for broader age ranges and Rb-Sr offering more refined age determinations for specific rock formations.",

                    "Answer": "The use of potassium-argon dilution method and whole-rock rubidium-strontium isochron dating can reveal the age and sequence of granitic rock formations in the region. These methods can help identify the timing of intrusive activities, ranging from the Precambrian Jinning period to the Cenozoic Himalayan period. This information is crucial for understanding the geological history and evolution of the granitic belts in the region, such as Kangdian ancient land, Ailao Mountain-Jinsha River, Lincang-Zuogong, and Luxi-Tengchong, which show a progression from older to younger ages.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of isotopic dating methods in researching the geochronology of granitic intrusions is influenced by factors such as the age range being studied, the geological history of the region, and the specific characteristics of the rock samples. In the context of the Hengduan Mountains, the frequent and widespread granitic intrusions from different geological periods, ranging from the Precambrian to the Cenozoic, necessitate using methods like potassium-argon dilution and rubidium-strontium isochron dating to accurately determine the isotopic geological ages of the granitic rocks.",
