            "description": "This data set is a 30m land use / cover classification product in the Sahel region of Africa every five years from 1990 to 2020. The product is based on a collaborative framework of land cover classification integrating machine learning and multiple data fusion, and integrates supervised land cover classification with existing thematic land cover maps by using Google Earth engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The classification system adopts FROM_ GLC classification system includes 8 categories: cultivated land, forest, grassland, shrub, wetland, water body, impervious surface and bare land. The data set has been verified by a large number of seasonal samples in the Sahel region. The overall accuracy of the data set is about 75%, and the accuracy of change area detection is more than 70%. It is also very similar to FAO and the existing land cover map. The data set can provide data support for the sustainable use of land resources and environmental protection in the Sahel region of Africa.",

                "Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change is a reliable indicator of the combined impacts of climate and anthropic activities on Earth. According to Lambin et al. [1] and Geist and Lambin [5], socioeconomic factors, e.g., population growth, poverty rate, human lifestyle changes, climatic conditions, and specific policies in each location at a given time are the major underlying causes of LULC change in Africa. The severe droughts in Africa in the 1970s and the 1980s exemplify how climate and anthropic activities may threaten natural vegetation growth, water bodies, and other natural resources with subsequent impacts on food security, economic livelihoods, and the social well-being of the continent’s people. In LULC change analysis, it is important to understand whether the detected changes are related to large fractional abundance, the size of the categories at the initial period, or whether transitions are more likely to occur for a particular category. Understanding these mechanisms may offer useful information about the active and dormant categories, i.e., categories with change intensities above or below the uniform intensity line, respectively. Despite the growing number of LULC change analyses at different spatial scales in West Africa and the entire continent at large, there are still gaps in the initial characterization of the change process. According to our global survey, there are existing long-term LULC maps over Africa. However, the classification accuracy and the inconsistency between different products hinder the spatially explicit monitoring of the patterns and processes underlying LULC change in Africa. The Landsat series satellite imagery have provided continuous global observations with a spatial resolution at 30 m since the 1980s, which is valuable for studying the patterns and processes, i.e., spatiotemporal configuration of LULC change over the African continent."

The specific aims of the research were to apply the intensity analysis framework."

By contrast, forestland areas experienced consistent decreases over the entire period, indicating deforestation and degradation. The settlement category also gained actively in all periods. Net losses of wetland and bare land categories were also observed in all of the periods. We observed net gains in water bodies in the 1990–2000 period and net losses in the 2010–2020 period. The simultaneous active gross loss and gain intensity of cropland raises food security concerns and should act as an early warning sign to policymakers that the food security of marginal geographic locations is under threat, despite the massive expansion of cropland observed in this study area."

                "Land cover is an important variable in studies of topics such as changes in environmental conditions, climate and biodiversity. The advent of many 30-m global products, e.g. land cover, cropland, forest, and water in the past few years has seen a new era of global land cover/use mapping in the 30 years after the advent of the first 30-m earth observation sensor. Most of those products use a single dataset, with a few exceptions using multiple datasets. Because of the complexity of the mapping objects, particularly vegetation-cover types, an increasing variety of features in land-cover classification have been considered as an important means of obtaining better-quality land cover maps. However, there are a major disadvantage that the overall resolution will be affected by lowest resolution sources, which means a nominal 30-m product is not necessarily a real 30-m product. Africa is one of the most impoverished but fast-developing regions in the world. Continuous improvements have been made in mapping the African continent using satellite data both at global and continental scales. However, low spatial resolutions and inconsistency among different products indicate that Africa is one of the most difficult regions for global land cover mapping. Previous studies showed discrepancies of up to 60% among satellite-derived cropland extent and statistical records in Africa and highlighted Africa as a mapping priority site with regard to the need for products with higher accuracy."

This information is particularly important for Africa, where food security, biodiversity loss, and climate change still pose threats to the terrestrial ecosystems and livelihoods of the continent.

The comparison above shows that the discrete CGLS-LC100 data performed the best with FAOSTAT records in most of the land cover types except for forest. One of the possible improvements is the generation of fraction layer for the vegetation types. It is particularly important for the area estimation because the mosaic type is one of the major error sources (Liu et al. 2018). However, challenges and further improvements are required. One of the questions is whether the three products achieved the agreement and reliability for the user community.
