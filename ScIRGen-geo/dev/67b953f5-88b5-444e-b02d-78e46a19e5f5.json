            "description": "The High Asia region is an area sensitive to global changes in mid-latitude regions and is a hotspot for research. The lakes in the territory are scattered, and the lake freeze-thaw process is one of the key factors sensitive to global change. Due to the large difference in the dielectric constant between ice and water, satellite-borne passive microwave remote sensing is weather insensitive and has a high revisiting rate; thus, it can achieve rapid monitoring of the freeze-thaw state of lakes. According to the area ratio of the lake and the land surface in the sub-pixels of passive microwave radiometer data, this data set represents the lake brightness temperature information of the pixel (sub-pixel level) by applying the hybrid pixel decomposition method in order to monitor the lake freeze-thaw process in the High Asia region. Thus, by adopting a variety of passive microwave data, time series of lake brightness temperature and freeze-thaw status were obtained for a total of 51 medium to large lakes from 2002 to 2016 in the High Asia region. Using cloudless MODIS optical products as validation data, three lakes of different sizes in different regions of High Asia, i.e., Hoh Xil Lake, Dagze Co Lake, and Kusai Lake, were selected for freeze-thaw detection validation. The results indicated that the lake freeze-thaw parameters obtained by microwave and optical remote sensing were highly consistent, and the correlation coefficients reached 0.968 and 0.987. This data set contained the time series brightness temperature of lakes and the freeze-thaw parameters of lake ice, which could be used to further invert the characteristic parameters of lakes and enhance the understanding of lake ice freezing and thawing in the High Asia region. This database will be useful in the assessment of climatic and environmental changes in the High Asia region and in global climatic change response models. The data set consists of two parts: the passive microwave remote sensing brightness temperature data set of 51 lakes in the High Asia region from 2002 to 2016, with an observation interval of 1 to 2 days, and the lake ice freeze-thaw data set obtained by estimation of the lake brightness temperature. The files are the lake brightness temperature data via the nearest neighbour method and pixel decomposition in the form of a .zip file (12 MB) and the lake freeze-thaw data set for 51 lakes in the High Asia region from 2002 to 2016 in the form of an .xls file (0.1 MB).",

                "The High Asia region is a sensitive area for mid-latitude global change and a hotspot for research. It is dotted with numerous lakes, and the freeze-thaw parameters of lake ice are one of the key sensitive factors in global change. Due to the significant differences in the dielectric constants of ice and water, satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing, which has a high revisit rate and is insensitive to weather conditions, can achieve rapid monitoring of lake ice freeze-thaw states. Research on climate change in the High Asia region has attracted widespread attention from scholars, making it one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change and a hotspot for research. Alpine lakes are very sensitive to climate change, and the timing of freeze-thaw in these lakes is often expected to record and reveal regional climate change characteristics. The High Asia region is characterized by its cold climate and sparse human presence, resulting in a lack of lake monitoring stations, making it difficult to obtain lake ice freeze-thaw parameters, which are typically supplemented through remote sensing methods. Satellite-based passive microwave data has characteristics such as all-time, all-weather capability, and short revisit cycles. Microwave sensing is highly sensitive to phase changes between ice and water, making it particularly suitable for monitoring freeze-thaw research, such as land surface freeze-thaw changes, snow cover changes, and sea ice changes."

                "Due to the coarse resolution of passive microwave radiometers and the serious mixed pixel effect, there are significant limitations in monitoring the freeze-thaw changes of lake ice. Currently, there are only 35 large lakes in the entire Northern Hemisphere that are suitable for monitoring with existing passive microwave pixel scales. In the High Asia region, large lakes such as Qinghai Lake, Namtso Lake, and Selincuo Lake can directly utilize passive microwave data for monitoring. Through data analysis, the passive microwave mixed pixel decomposition method can generally be applied to lakes that occupy more than 0.3 times the area of a single AMSR-E pixel. However, when the lake area is between 0.2 and 0.3 times the AMSR-E pixel, the method is significantly influenced by the shape of the lake, the characteristics of the lake itself, and the geographical environment around the lake, resulting in considerable uncertainty."

These datasets are used to extract brightness temperature values for lake areas, calculate the dynamic area ratio of lakes to their shores, and validate lake ice freeze-thaw parameters. To obtain brightness temperature information for lake areas, the study selects pixels based on the shortest distance from the pixel to the lake center point using AMSR-E, AMSR2, or MWRI data. Due to the low spatial resolution of passive microwave data, a single pixel can capture various types of surface feature information, leading to significant mixing effects. The study employs radiometrically calibrated AMSR-E L2A and AMSR2 L1R brightness temperature data and uses a mixed pixel decomposition algorithm based on the lake/land area ratio to obtain lake brightness temperature data. The long-term brightness temperature curve for lakes obtained using the pixel decomposition method is shown in Figure 6."

However, it suffers from low spatial resolution and mixed-pixel effects. In contrast, optical remote sensing data, like MODIS, offers higher spatial resolution and can provide cloud-free data for validation but is limited by weather conditions and daylight availability. The two methods complement each other, with microwave data providing consistent temporal monitoring and optical data offering higher spatial detail for specific events.",

                    "Answer": "The mixed-pixel decomposition method addresses spatial resolution challenges by accounting for the proportion of lake and land within a pixel, enabling extraction of sub-pixel level lake brightness temperature information. This contrasts with traditional pixel-based methods, which may not effectively resolve mixed-pixel issues due to lower spatial resolution of passive microwave data. The decomposition method provides more accurate monitoring of freeze-thaw states in lakes where the lake area significantly influences the pixel's microwave signal, especially when the lake area is at least 0.3 times the AMSR-E pixel size.",
