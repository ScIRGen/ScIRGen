            "description": "The surface elevation of the ice sheet is very sensitive to climate change, so the elevation change of the ice sheet is considered as an important variable to evaluate climate change. The time series of long-term ice sheet surface elevation change has become a fundamental data for understanding climate change. The longest time series of ice sheet surface elevation can be established by combining the observation records of radar satellite altimetry missions. However, the previous methods for correcting the intermission bias still have error residue when cross-calibrating different missions. Therefore，we modify the commonly used plane-fitting least-squares regression model by restricting the correction of intermission bias and the ascending–descending bias at the same time to ensure the self-consistency and coherence of surface elevation time series across different missions. Based on this method, we use Envisat and CryoSat-2 data to construct the time series of Antarctic ice sheet elevation change from 2002 to 2019. The time series is the monthly grid data, and the spatial grid resolution is 5 km×5 km. Using airborne and satellite laser altimetry data to evaluate the results, it is found that compared with the traditional method, this method can improve the accuracy of intermission bias correction by 40%. Using the merged elevation time series, combining with firn densification-modeled volume changes due to surface processes, we find that ice dynamic processes make the ice sheet along the Amundsen Sea sector the largest volume loss of the Antarctic ice sheet. The surface processes dominate the volume changes in Totten Glacier sector, Dronning Maud Land, Princess Elizabeth Land, and the Bellingshausen Sea sector. Overall, accelerated volume loss in the West Antarctic continues to outpace the gains observed in the East Antarctic. The total volume change during 2002–2019 for the AIS was −68.7 ± 8.1 km3/y, with an acceleration of −5.5 ± 0.9 km3/y2.",

This method involves the use of a modified plane-fitting model to correct for task and ascending/descending orbit biases, which improves the accuracy of task bias correction by 40% compared to traditional methods.

These errors persist even after applying traditional correction methods, which may not fully account for inter-mission biases and ascending/descending orbit discrepancies. By modifying the plane fitting model and employing simultaneous constraints for bias corrections, the accuracy of the mission bias corrections can be significantly improved, as demonstrated by the use of Envisat and CryoSat-2 data to construct an Antarctic ice sheet elevation change time series from 2002 to 2019.",

A long-term time series of ice sheet surface elevation changes is crucial for understanding these impacts. The goal is to create a coherent and consistent time series through improved bias correction methods across different satellite missions, using Envisat and CryoSat-2 data, with enhanced precision in inter-mission bias correction. This approach aids in understanding the dynamics of ice volume loss, particularly in regions like the Amundsen Sea coast, and the differing processes affecting ice volume across various parts of Antarctica.",
