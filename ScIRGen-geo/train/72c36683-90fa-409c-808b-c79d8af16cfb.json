            "description": "The dataset is the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) products of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau. The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the NDMI equation which use the difference ratio between the NIR band and SWIR2 band to quantitatively reflect the water content of vegetation canopy. And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow. NDMI is highly correlated with canopy water content and can be used to estimate vegetation water content, and it is also used to analyze the change of land surface temperature because it is strongly correlated with land surface temperature.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the NDMI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the NDMI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDMI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDMI;the NDMI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDMI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDMI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the NDMI results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the NDMI results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
