            "description": "On 26 July 2012, a Wide-angle Infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner (WIDAS)  carried by the Y-12 aircraft was used in a visible near Infrared thermal Dual-mode airborne remote sensing experiment, which is located in the artificial oasis eco-hydrology experimental area (5×5 km). WIDAS includes an CCD cameras with spatial resolution 0.2 m, a visible near Infrared multispectral camera with five bands scanner (an maximum observation angle 48° and spatial resolution 1 m), and a thermal image camera with spatial resolution 4.8 m.\nThe CCD camera data are recorded in DN values processed by mosaic and orthorectification. The multispectral camera data are recorded in reflectance processed by atmospheric and geometric correction. Thermal image camera data are recorded in radiation brightness temperature processed by atmospheric and geometric correction.",

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
