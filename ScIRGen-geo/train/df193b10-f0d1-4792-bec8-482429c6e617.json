            "description": "The site data of this data set comes from the prehistoric archaeological investigation report of Hexi Corridor compiled and published by Gansu Institute of cultural relics and Archaeology and Peking University School of Archaeology and culture in 2011. Map data comes from the national science and technology infrastructure platform -- National Earth system science data sharing service platform（ http://www.geodata.cn/ ）Including: 90 m resolution DEM of China; China 1:250000 first, third, fourth and fifth river classification data sets; 1 ∶ 4000000 vegetation data set of China; 1 ∶ 100000 desert data set in China. By sorting out the archaeological survey data of Hexi Corridor, applying the methods of cultural distribution boundary value and cultural center of gravity, this paper comprehensively analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution process of ancient culture in this area, and extracts the current environment (elevation, river, vegetation and sand) information of corresponding sites by using GIS technology, It also analyzes the driving mechanism of the evolution of ancient culture in the region. This data set can directly provide some regular support for the ancient and modern evolution of the sites in Hexi corridor.",

This involves analyzing the spatial distribution and temporal changes of cultural sites and their environmental contexts, using methods like cultural distribution thresholds and cultural centers, aided by GIS technology to extract present-day environmental information such as elevation, rivers, vegetation, and desert conditions.",

This approach helps in understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of ancient cultures and their interactions with the environment, enabling the study of cultural evolution and environmental changes in the Hexi Corridor.",

                    "Answer": "To analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of ancient cultural sites in the 河西走廊 region, one can start by compiling archaeological site data obtained from institutions such as the 甘肃省文物考古研究所 and the 北京大学考古文博学院. This involves organizing and interpreting data sourced from historical surveys. Next, integrate this data with modern environmental datasets from platforms like the 国家地球系统科学数据共享服务平台, which provide information on DEM, river classification, vegetation, and desert data. Use GIS technology to extract relevant environmental information such as elevation, river proximity, vegetation, and sand areas for the site locations. Finally, conduct a comprehensive analysis using cultural distribution thresholds and centrality methods to infer the evolution of ancient cultures in relation to environmental changes, while considering ancient human lifestyles to hypothesize about past and present environmental shifts and their underlying causes.",
