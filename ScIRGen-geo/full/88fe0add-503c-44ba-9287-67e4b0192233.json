            "description": "The new data set including environmental indices and OSL dating data  of late Holocene aeolian sediments in Qaidam basin.Nuomuhong culture (~3400–2450 BP) and Tuyuhun (313–663 CE) were unique ancient civilizations that developed in the eastern Qaidam Basin of the north Tibetan Plateau. However, how precipitation variation in the mountain–basin system has affected the rise and fall of these two ancient civilizations is not well understood.Based on analyses of grain size, magnetic susceptibility, Rb/Sr ratio, loss on ignition, and optically stimulated luminescence dates from an aeolian deposit sequence, lowland climate change in the Qaidam Basin during the late Holocene is reconstructed. The climate was relatively dry during ~2500–2300 BP and ~1600–1400 BP and relatively wet during ~2300–1600 BP in the lowlands of the eastern Qaidam Basin, which corresponded well to the gap between the Nuomuhong and Tuyuhun periods.However, the prosperous periods of the Nuomuhong and Tuyuhun were synchronous with high precipitation in the surrounding mountains. Therefore, high precipitation in the surrounding mountains nourished the expansion of oases and then facilitated the development of Nuomuhong and Tuyuhun, which was inconsistent with precipitation variation in the lowlands of eastern Qaidam Basin.

                    "Answer": "In the context of data collection for environmental studies, '光释光测年' refers to optically stimulated luminescence dating, a technique used to determine the last time mineral grains were exposed to light. This method is particularly useful for dating wind-blown sediments and helps in reconstructing past climate changes by providing chronological data on sediment deposition.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method involving grain size, magnetic susceptibility, Rb/Sr ratios, and loss on ignition focuses on analyzing physical and chemical properties of aeolian deposits, which can provide insights into past environmental conditions, such as dryness or wetness. In contrast, luminescence dating techniques provide chronological information, allowing researchers to determine the age of sediment layers. Both approaches are complementary; the former provides contexts and indicators of environmental changes, while the latter establishes a timeline for these changes, crucial for understanding the climatic conditions during the late Holocene in the Qaidam Basin.",

                    "Answer": "The patterns in grain size, magnetization rate, and Rb/Sr ratios indicate shifts in environmental conditions, such as precipitation and wind patterns, that influenced the sediment deposition. Specifically, during periods of relative dryness (2500-2300 BP and 1600-1400 BP), these indicators suggest decreased precipitation and possibly reduced vegetation cover, while the period of relative wetness (2300-1600 BP) suggests increased precipitation, which aligns with the flourishing of local ancient cultures like the Nuomuhong and Tuyuhun civilizations.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of environmental indicators and dating data collection in aeolian sediment layers of the Qaidam Basin is influenced by the analysis of grain size, magnetic susceptibility, Rb/Sr ratios, loss on ignition, and optically stimulated luminescence dating. These methods help reconstruct lowland climate changes during the Late Holocene, revealing periods of relative dryness and wetness that correspond to the intervals of the Nuomuhong and Tuyuhun cultural periods. Additionally, the synchronization of high precipitation in surrounding mountain areas with the flourishing periods of these cultures suggests that changes in lowland precipitation, nourished by mountainous rainfall, contributed to the expansion of oases and the development of these ancient civilizations.",

                    "Answer": "Using these data collection methods allows researchers to reconstruct climatic conditions by analyzing sedimentary sequences, revealing that during the late Holocene, the eastern lowland of the Qaidam Basin experienced periods of relatively dry climate between 2500-2300 BP and 1600-1400 BP, and a relatively wet climate between 2300-1600 BP. This aligns with the cultural periods of Nuomuhong and Tuyuhun, showing that changes in lowland precipitation were synchronized with increased precipitation in surrounding mountainous areas, nurturing the expansion of oases and facilitating the development of these ancient cultures.",
