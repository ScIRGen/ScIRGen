            "description": "The data are major and trace element data, zircon U-Pb dating data, zircon Hf isotopic data and whole rock SR Nd isotopic data of ore bearing syenite in shapinggou, East Qinling Dabie orogenic belt. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The whole rock SR Nd isotopes were obtained by MC – ICP – MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can better constrain the geochronology, diagenetic and metallogenic sources and geodynamic background of the giant molybdenum deposit.",
