All passive microwave products after splicing are extrapolated using cloud motion vectors, and fused with infrared precipitation products from stationary satellites such as GOES, MetSat, and Himawari through Kalman filtering. The high-quality microwave precipitation products of the FY-3 series satellites can effectively supplement the errors caused by microwave observation gaps in IMERG, providing a more reliable dataset for global precipitation research.

                "Precipitation provides water resources but can also cause disasters. The amount, intensity, and frequency of precipitation have significant impacts on ecosystems, people’s health, and socioeconomic systems. However, due to its spatiotemporal discontinuity, accurately estimating precipitation remains a great challenge. To estimate global precipitation at the required spatial and temporal resolutions, active microwave and passive microwave (PMW) observations from low-Earth-orbit satellites and infrared observations from geostationary satellites must be integrated. Precipitation radar (active microwave) systems onboard low-Earth-orbit satellites can directly detect the intensity and location of precipitation, but the obtained data are too sparse and are primarily used to calibrate PMW retrievals. Infrared sensors onboard geostationary satellites have high temporal resolution but cannot penetrate clouds and can only sense cloud-top features. PMW sensors on low-Earth-orbit satellites have a low temporal resolution but can penetrate clouds and capture information from precipitation particles, making them the core of global precipitation products. The aging issue of the current global precipitation constellation has further limited the availability of PMW data, thus limiting the quality of IMERG products. This issue can be addressed by including more satellite PMW data that have not yet been adopted in the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation, such as data from the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellites, into the current products and analyses."

After merging the FY-3 and IMERG products, the diurnal cycles of the precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity became closer to those of the gauge observations. The RMSE and bias results indicate a noticeable improvement in the errors associated with the PMW gap in the IMERG product after the FY-3 data were added, and the quality of the merged data was greatly enhanced. The machine learning retrieval method proposed in this paper can provide high-quality PMW precipitation products based on FY-3 satellites. The RMSEs of FY-3C, FY-3D, and FY-3E are smaller than those of IMERG by approximately 9.9%, 18%, and 19.5%, respectively. The high-quality PMW precipitation products from the FY-3 satellites can supplement the gap in PMW observations in the IMERG constellation. The accuracy of the global precipitation data therefore improved by 16% based on the RMSE in reference to the hourly observations collected during a whole year at 400 weather stations in China, Europe, and the United States. The overestimation of precipitation in the IMERG product decreased by 32%, and the overestimation of intensity decreased by 63%."
