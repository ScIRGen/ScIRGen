            "titleEn": "HiWATER: The multi-scale observation experiment on evapotranspiration over heterogeneous land surfaces (MUSOEXE-12)-dataset of flux observation matrix (No.5 eddy covariance system) from Jun to Sep, 2012",
            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from site No.5 eddy covariance system (EC) in the flux observation matrix from 3 June to 18 September, 2012. The site (100.35068° E, 38.87574° N) was located in a cropland (maize surface) in Yingke irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1567.65 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3 m; the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500) was 0.17 m.\nRaw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Edire post-processing software (University of Edinburgh, http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/abs/research/micromet/EdiRe/), including spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. Moreover, the observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC), which was proposed by Foken and Wichura [1996]: class 1 (level 0: Δst<30 and ITC<30), class 2 (level 1: Δst<100 and ITC<100), and class 3 (level 2: Δst>100 and ITC>100), representing high-, medium-, and low-quality data, respectively. In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day; the missing data were replaced with -6999. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m^3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m^3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m^2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m^2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m^2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xlsx format.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance method is a data collection technique used to measure surface fluxes of gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide. It involves using instruments such as an ultrasonic anemometer and a CO2/H2O analyzer to capture data at high frequencies (e.g., 10Hz). This method calculates fluxes by analyzing the covariance between vertical wind speed and scalar quantities like CO2 and H2O concentrations. The process typically includes several data processing steps, such as despiking, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic temperature correction, and density correction, to ensure accurate flux measurements.",

                    "Answer": "The data quality evaluation methods for eddy covariance flux measurements involve assessing atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics, which are specific to flux measurements. This includes tests such as atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity (ITC) evaluations. The quality is marked with identifiers ranging from 0 to 2 based on these evaluations. In comparison, other meteorological data collection techniques might use different criteria for quality evaluation, such as calibration checks, sensor drift analysis, or instrument error monitoring, which may not specifically address turbulence or atmospheric stability.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives include understanding surface evapotranspiration at multiple scales, assessing the impact of different surface conditions like crops (e.g., corn) on fluxes, and improving the accuracy of flux measurements through data processing techniques such as coordinate rotation and frequency response correction.",

                    "Answer": "The preprocessing of eddy covariance flux observation data involves several steps to ensure data quality and accuracy, including: removing outlier values, correcting for delay time, performing coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), applying frequency response corrections, correcting for ultrasonic virtual temperature, and applying density (WPL) corrections. Additionally, quality evaluation of flux values is conducted, focusing on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data selection criteria include discarding erroneous instrument data, excluding data one hour before and after precipitation, removing data with more than 3% missing in original 10Hz data per 30 minutes, and excluding nighttime weak turbulence data where u* is less than 0.1 m/s. Suspicious data due to instrument drift are marked in red. The average observation period is 30 minutes, with missing data marked as -6999.",
