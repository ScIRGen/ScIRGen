            "description": "By archaeological investigation and excavation in Tibetan Plateau, we discovered 14 Paleolithic sites, including 151,  Baishiya karst cave，Meilongdapu cave, Hejishihuotang and Tangda. In this dataset, there are some basic informations about these sites, such as location, longitude, latitude, altitude, material culture and so on. On this Basis, we identified and analysed stone artifacts, animal remains and plant fossil, and obtained a batch of dating data of uranium series, radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence. This dataset provide important basic data for understanding when and how prehistoric human lived in the Tibetan Plateau during the Paleolithic.",

                    "Answer": "Factors contributing to these challenges include the remote and high-altitude locations of the sites, which can make access and excavation difficult. Additionally, the preservation conditions can vary, affecting the integrity of the artifacts and remains. Precise scientific collection and identification are needed to distinguish between different types of stone tools and faunal remains, which requires specific expertise and laboratory analysis. The variability in sedimentation and geological activity in the region could also impact the stratigraphy and context of the findings.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of conducting archaeological surveys and excavations at Paleolithic sites on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are to gather fundamental information about the sites' geographical and cultural attributes, such as latitude, longitude, elevation, cultural properties, and cultural relics. Additionally, the aim is to scientifically collect, identify, and analyze stone artifacts and faunal remains from these sites. This is done to obtain uranium-series dating data, carbon-14 dating data, luminescence dating data, and to analyze the types of stone artifacts and raw materials, as well as to identify the distribution of faunal remains. The data collection methods are influenced by these objectives as they ensure a comprehensive and rigorous approach to understanding the activity history and subsistence patterns of Paleolithic ancestors on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

During these activities, scientific collection, identification, and laboratory analysis of stone tools and faunal and floral remains are conducted. These processes yield uranium series dating data, carbon-14 dating data, and optically stimulated luminescence dating data, providing essential insights into the history and subsistence patterns of early inhabitants.",
