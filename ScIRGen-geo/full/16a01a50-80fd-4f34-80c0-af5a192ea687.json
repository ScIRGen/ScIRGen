            "description": "The data is the land cover data of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, with a spatial resolution of 300 meters and a temporal resolution of years. The data includes three periods of 1995, 2005 and 2015. The data is in grid format (TIFF), using the 2000 national geodetic coordinate system, and can be opened using software tools such as ArcGIS and envi. The original data comes from the European Copernicus climate change service data center. With reference to the \"land cover classification system\" developed by the food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the global land cover types are divided into 22 categories. Because of its high accuracy, consistency and annual update, this data has been widely used in the fields of land use and human activity change monitoring worldwide. Based on the original data, this data is obtained in ArcGIS through clipping, projection, accuracy verification, and quality audit by a second person. The data quality is reliable.",

This data typically includes various categories of land cover types such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, urban areas, and bodies of water, among others. The data is often collected using remote sensing technologies and can be used for monitoring changes in land use and human activities over time. The land cover data is generally provided in raster format, like Tiff, and is characterized by spatial and temporal resolutions, such as 300 meters and annual updates, respectively.",

This data, which follows the 'Land Cover Classification System' developed by the FAO, is then processed using ArcGIS by performing steps such as clipping to the specific region of interest, re-projecting to the 2000 national geodetic coordinate system, and validating precision. After these processes, the data undergoes quality assurance checks by a second individual to ensure reliability. The outcome is a high-accuracy, consistent dataset suitable for monitoring land use and human activity changes.",
