            "description": "Plateau medicine and human physiology research in Kekexili area of Qinghai Province, the data are from the comprehensive scientific investigation of Kekexili area carried out from May to August 1990. With the human marching into the plateau area, plateau medicine, a main branch of environmental medicine, is quietly rising. Although the research of plateau medicine has gone through more than a century (1987), many mechanisms remain unresolved. Medical scientists have organized academic mountaineering for many times to carry out Alpine medical investigation (West JB, 1982; Wu T, y, 1992). However, most of them are limited to observing the changes of the internal environment of the aircraft through the intense movement of climbing mountains, which is far from the daily life and labor of human beings on the plateau. After almost all the mountains in the world have been conquered by human beings, there are still a few highland hinterlands that have not been set foot in. Hoh Xil is such a \"no man's land\" on the earth. The magical color and adventurous career are attracting brave explorers. The effects of high altitude hypoxia, low temperature, low humidity and strong ultraviolet on human body are the most attractive research fields in Applied Physiology.",

                    "Answer": "A comprehensive scientific expedition conducted from May to August 1990 in the Qinghai Kekexili region serves as an example. This expedition focused on observing physiological changes in humans due to high-altitude conditions, such as low oxygen levels, low temperature, low humidity, and strong ultraviolet radiation. The study was part of an effort to understand human adaptation in high-altitude environments, distinguishing itself from prior studies that were limited to observing changes during intense mountain climbing.",

These conditions can impact the body's internal environment, and examining data on these variables can reveal insights into the mechanisms of acclimatization and adaptation in high-altitude settings.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity of collecting data in high-altitude regions such as Qinghai Kekexili is influenced by several environmental factors including low oxygen levels, low temperatures, low humidity, and strong ultraviolet radiation. These factors make it challenging to simulate the typical living and working conditions of humans in high-altitude areas, as opposed to the more intense physical activities like mountain climbing often used in studies. Additionally, the remoteness and inaccessibility of these regions add to the difficulty of data collection.",

These factors may lead to physiological responses that are difficult to replicate or control in laboratory settings, complicating the interpretation of data. Additionally, the harsh conditions may affect the performance and reliability of data collection equipment, potentially leading to errors or data loss.",
