            "description": "This dataset includes quartz OSL dating, AMS 14C dating, grain size and magnetic susceptibilities for the Maerkang loess section in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The quartz OSL dating and the grain size and magnetic susceptibility were measured at the Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University. The pretreatment of AMS14C samples were conducted at the Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), and the AMS measurements were conducted at Peking University. The dataset provides a detailed chronology, dust deposition and paleoenvironmental histories since the MIS 3 of the Maerkang loess in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The results provide new evidence for a better understanding of the history of environmental change and dust activities on the Tibetan Plateau since MIS 3.",
