            "description": "This data is the major and trace elements of Cretaceous monzonite, biotite, zircon U-Pb isotopic dating data and zircon Lu Hf isotopic data in Chuzhou area of the lower Yangtze River metallogenic belt. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The major elements of biotite were obtained by EPMA analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can better understand the petrogenesis and put forward more solid constraints on the geological evolution of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",
