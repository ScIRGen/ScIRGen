            "description": "（1）An Ms 6.0 earthquake struck Changning county, Sichuan basin, SW China on 17 June 2019, which caused huge casualties and economic losses. Four Ms greater than 5.0 events subsequently occurred around the Changning source area, three of which occurred within one week. In order to better understand the mechanism of these moderate-sized earthquakes, we determine 3-D high-resolution velocity models around the source area simultaneously relocating earthquakes using double-difference tomography. In the present study, we use a total of 53,487 P-wave and 52,527 S-wave arrival times from 8818 events recorded at 39 seismic stations. Our results show that focal depths of the Changning mainshock and most aftershocks are ~5–10 km, and they form a fault plane with a steep dip angle. Most earthquakes are underlain by the zone with low Vp, low Vs, and high Vp/Vs anomalies, reflecting the existence of fluids there. These results suggest that the Changning mainshock and other moderate-sized earthquakes might be associated with the influence of fluids that could decrease effective normal stress on the fault planes. These fluids might be related to the hot and wet mantle upwelling in the big mantle wedge due to the deep subduction of the Indian plate down to the mantle transition zone. A clear high-to-low velocity transition zone is observed at ~10 km depth beneath the Gongxian and Xingwen swarms, which matches well with the detachment layer revealed by deep seismic soundings in the area. All these results suggest that the structural contrast could control the mainshock generation and aftershock extension.\n（2）The Tanlu fault zone is the most significant active fault in eastern China, which generated the great 1668 Tancheng earthquake (M 8.5). It is still unclear whether or not there is a link between the great earthquake generation and the upper-mantle structure. To address this issue, we study P-wave upper-mantle tomography beneath eastern China using 44,047 teleseismic P-wave arrival times. Our results show that at depths<150 km, high-velocity (high-V) anomalies appear west of the Tanlu fault zone, whereas low-velocity (low-V) anomalies are visible east of the fault zone. Strong lateral heterogeneities are revealed along the fault zone. At depths of 230–470 km, northwest of the Tanlu fault zone, there are obvious low-V anomalies that may reflect hot and wet mantle upwelling, whereas to the east high-V anomalies are visible, which may reflect the detached Eurasian lithosphere (downwelling). In the mantle transition zone (MTZ), both high-V and low-V anomalies are revealed, and the widespread high-V anomalies may reflect the stagnant Pacific slab. Beneath the hypocenter of the 1668 Tancheng earthquake, intermittent low-V anomalies are revealed in the upper mantle down to the MTZ depth, which may reflect hot and wet mantle upwelling flow. Integrating the present results with previous findings, we deem that the Tancheng earthquake was affected by fluids from the hot and wet mantle upwelling associated with the lithospheric delamination. Complicated mantle convection, including both upwelling and downwelling flows, may occur under the Tanlu fault zone in the big mantle wedge above the stagnant Pacific slab in the MTZ.\n（3）Since the occurrence of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms8.0), many researchers have conducted extensive seismological and geophysical observations and investigations and obtained important results about the Longmenshan fault zone.\nCrustal structure inferred from local tomography shows that seismic velocity exhibits significant changes across the Wenchuan earthquake hypocenter from the south to the north. To the south, obvious low-velocity (low-V) anomalies exist, whereas strong lateral heterogeneities are revealed to the north, which may explain why the aftershocks extend northeastward. The Wenchuan earthquake occurred at the boundary between high-velocity (high-V) and low-V anomalies and a significant low-V zone is revealed below the mainshock hypocenter, suggesting that the nucleation of the Wenchuan earthquake was related to partial melts and/or fluid effects and associated with the reduction of effective normal stress on the fault plane, due to high temperature and high pressure in the Longmenshan fault zone caused by the India-Asia collision. The upper-mantle structure inferred from teleseismic tomography shows that the Longmenshan fault zone is located in the transition zone from low-V anomalies beneath the Songpan-Ganzi block to high-V anomalies beneath the Sichuan basin. This structural feature extends down to 200−300 km depths. High-V anomalies in the mantle transition zone are connected with those in the upper mantle beneath the Burma arc, indicating that the Wenchuan earthquake could be associated with upwelling of hot and wet materials in the big mantle wedge formed by the deep subduction of the Indian plate. These results suggest that the generation of the Wenchuan earthquake was related to structural heterogeneities in not only the crust but also the upper mantle.  In addition, the Wenchuan earthquake may be related to the lower crustal flow, crustal shortening and Zipingpu Reservoir triggering.",
            "descriptionCn": "（1）2019年6月17日，中国西南部四川盆地长宁县发生6.0级地震，造成巨大人员伤亡和经济损失。随后，长宁震源区周边发生了4起大于5.0 Ms的地震事件，其中3起发生在一周内。为了更好地理解这些中等规模地震的发生机制，我们利用双差层析成像技术，在震源区周围进行了地震重定位，同时建立了三维高分辨率速度模型。在本研究中，我们使用了39个地震台站记录的8818个地震事件的53487个P波和52527个S波到时间。结果表明，长宁主震和大部分余震震源深度约5～10km，形成一个陡倾角的断层面。大多数地震都在低Vp、低Vs和高Vp/Vs异常带的下方，反映了那里存在流体。这些结果表明，长宁主震和其他中等规模地震可能与流体降低了断层面有效正应力的影响有关。这些流体可能与印度板块向地幔过渡带的深俯冲导致大地幔楔中的热湿地幔上涌有关。在巩县群和兴文群下方约10km深处，观察到一条明显的高低速过渡带，与该区深部地震探测揭示的滑脱层吻合较好。这些结果表明，构造对比可以控制主震的产生和余震的扩展。\n（2）郯庐断裂带是我国东部最重要的活动断裂带，发生过1668年郯城8.5级地震。目前尚不清楚大地震的发生与上地幔结构之间是否存在联系。为了解决这个问题，我们利用44047个远震P波到达时间研究了中国东部地区的P波上地幔层析成像。结果表明，在深度小于150km时，郯庐断裂带以西出现高波速异常，而断裂带以东出现低波速异常。沿断裂带显示出强烈的横向不均质性。在郯庐断裂带西北部230～470km深处，存在明显的低波速异常，可能反映了热湿地幔的上涌，而在东部，高波速异常是十分清晰的，可能反映了拆沉的欧亚岩石圈（下降流）。地幔转换带既有高波速异常，也有低波速异常，大范围的高波速异常可能反映了滞留的太平洋板块。在1668年郯城地震的震源下，上地幔至地幔转换带深度出现了间歇性的低波速异常，反映了热湿地幔上涌流。综合目前的研究结果和以往的研究结果，我们认为郯城地震是受岩石圈拆沉引起的热湿地幔上涌流体的影响。在郯庐断裂带下方，地幔转换带中滞留的太平洋板块上方的大地幔楔可能发生复杂的地幔对流，包括上升流和下降流。\n（3）汶川地震后, 为认识发震机理, 在龙门山断裂带及周边地区开展了丰富的地震学和地球物理学等方面的 野外观测与研究工作, 获得了有意义研究成果. 近震成像获得的地壳结构显示, 以汶川主震震中为界, 龙门山断 裂带南北两侧波速存在明显差别, 以南地区为明显低波速异常, 而以北地区为显著横向不均匀性, 这也许可以解 释汶川地震的余震为何向东北方向延伸. 汶川主震发生在高低波速异常的边界, 且其下方存在低波速高泊松比异 常. 这一结果表明, 印度-欧亚板块的碰撞挤压在龙门山断裂带附近形成的高温高压导致了部分熔融或流体作用, 降低了断层面处的有效正应力, 因而诱发了汶川地震. 远震成像获得的上地幔结构显示, 龙门山断裂带处于松潘甘孜地块下方的低波速异常向四川盆地下方的高波速异常的过渡区, 且这种结构延伸至200~300 km深度, 而在地 幔转换带中的高波速异常与缅甸弧下方的上地幔高波速异常相连接, 说明汶川地震的发生与印度板块深俯冲而形 成的“大地幔楔”结构中的低波速异常所代表的热湿上涌等动力学过程密切相关. 因此, 本文认为汶川地震不 仅与地壳结构密切相关, 而且还受上地幔异常结构的影响. 另外, 汶川地震还可能与下地壳流、地壳缩短和紫坪铺 水库触发等动力学过程有关.",

These insights can help in identifying the causes of earthquakes, such as fluid-induced stress changes and deep mantle processes, which are crucial for understanding earthquake mechanisms and improving prediction models.",
                "AnswerCn": "高分辨率速度模型可以揭示诸如断层面深度和结构、地壳中流体的存在以及流体在降低断层面有效法向应力中的作用等细节。这些见解有助于识别地震的成因，例如流体诱导的应力变化和深地幔过程，这对于理解地震机制和改进预测模型至关重要。",

                "AnswerEn": "Exploring the relationship between mantle structure and earthquake occurrences through seismic tomography in regions like southern China is significant because it helps understand the mechanisms behind earthquakes, such as those induced by fluid presence that reduce effective normal stress on fault planes. This understanding can facilitate the identification of tectonic controls on earthquake generation and propagation, as seen in the Sichuan Basin and the Tanlu Fault Zone. Additionally, it sheds light on the impact of deep mantle dynamics, like subduction and upwelling processes, on seismic activity.",

Data is collected from multiple seismic stations, as exemplified by the recording of 8818 earthquake events using 39 stations, capturing P and S wave arrival times. The analysis involves studying velocity anomalies, such as low Vp, low Vs, and high Vp/Vs, which can reflect geological features like fluid presence or fault activities.",
