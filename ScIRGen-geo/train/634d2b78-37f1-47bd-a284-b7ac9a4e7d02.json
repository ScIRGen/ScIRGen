This method allows for detailed ground truth data collection, enhancing the accuracy of satellite-derived temperature estimates. However, the reliance on handheld devices could lead to variability in measurements due to human error or environmental factors, potentially affecting data reliability. The systematic collection approach, with measurements taken at regular intervals and synchronized bands, helps mitigate some of these challenges by providing a structured and repeatable data collection framework.",
