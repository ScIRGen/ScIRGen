            "description": "Glacier surface albedo is a key parameter in the process of glacier mass and energy balance. The data include annual mean glacier surface albedo and annual minimum glacier surface albedo for each year of the 2000-2020 ablation period (June-August) in the  High Mountain Asia. Based on the MODIS 500m resolution daily snow albedo products (including MOD10A1 and MYD10A1), firstly, mean-synthesis was applied to the morning star data MOD10A1 and afternoon star data MYD10A1, followed by interpolation and null-filling using mean-filtering for data within a ±2 day window, and finally based on the minimum and mean methods to obtain the annual mean albedo and annual minimum albedo for glaciers in High Mountain Asia were obtained based on the minimum and mean methods. Compared to the original data, the accuracy and coverage of the data are greatly improved. It can provide ice surface albedo input data for studying the relationship between glacier albedo and matss balance and for glacier models.",

                "Glaciers are sensitive to global climate change and are indicators of climate change (Benn and Lehmkuhl, 2000). During the period from 1961 to 2016, it has been estimated that the magnitude of global glacier mass loss contributed 27 ± 22 mm to sea level rise (Zemp et al., 2019). The High Mountain Asia (HMA) has the largest area and the widest range of mountain glaciers in the middle and high latitudes. The glacier area reaches 97,605 km2 (Hugonnet et al., 2021), HMA includes central Asia, Southwest Asia and Southeast Asia, and studies have shown that these regions have experienced glacier mass loss in recent years (Shean et al., 2020; Hugonnet et al., 2021). The dynamics of mass balance can cause changes in glacier area and regional runoff, which can have a significantly impact on regional hydrological and water resources, particularly in the HMA (Chaturvedi et al., 2014; Lutz et al., 2014). Several methods have been used to measure glacier mass balance, including field measurements, model retrievals, geodetic measurements and ice surface parameter methods (Bamber and Rivera, 2007). Some scholars have combined field measurements and mass balance models (Machguth et al., 2006; Konz and Seibert, 2010) to study mass balance over a long time series (Michlmayr et al., 2008; Huss, 2012; Zemp et al., 2013). However, in some regions with harsh environmental conditions and poor transportation, field measurements are limited. In recent years, remote sensing data have been combined with geodetic methods to calculate the change of glacier surface elevation and mass balance retrieved (Kääb et al., 2012; Brun et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018).",
                "Albedo is directly related to solar radiation, which provides the main source of energy for glacier melting, and the solar radiation absorbed by the glacier surface is determined by a combination of incident solar shortwave radiation and the glacier surface albedo. Therefore, the magnitude of glacier surface albedo is a key parameter of the glacier mass and energy balance process, and it directly affects the annual mass balance. Greuell and Oerlemans (2005) pointed out that the minimum albedo method has good applicability for glaciers with small accumulations. For larger glaciers, the mean albedo method has better applicability than the minimum albedo method, and the mean albedo method is also well correlated with mass balance such as in Svalbard and Greenland. Studies have shown that global glacier surface albedo has decreased since the 21st century, and as the glacier surface albedo decreases, it can accelerate melting and mass loss in glacial regions.",
                "Annual changes in glacier albedo may be a good proxy for mass balance. The albedo –mass balance relationship was assessed by establishing a statistical relationship between measured annual albedo by satellite observations and in situ measured mass balance at four glaciers. The harmonic model can be applied to interpolate and fill data with obvious seasonal variation characteristics, such as the normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature."

However, for large-area glaciers, it is difficult to establish the relationship between the annual mass balance and albedo due to the difficulty in obtaining the measured glacier mass balance. MODIS products suffer from data discontinuities in time and space due to cloud cover. In the Tibetan Plateau, the annual average cloud coverage observed by MODIS exceeds 40%.",
                "Increasing temperatures, decreasing precipitation, and deposition of light-absorbing impurities such as black carbon or mineral dust could cause the reduction in glacial albedo, and can accelerate glacier melting.",
                "Glacier mass balance from DEMs and MODIS-retrieved surface albedo has some uncertainties, leading to some uncertainties in the relationship between mass balance and albedo changes. This study found that the linear relationship is not applicable to W Kunlun, E Kunlun, Qilian Shan, Inner Tibet, and W Himalaya, which have no seasonal variations or unique albedo characteristics."

Then, the glacier-wide albedo changes from 2000 to 2016 were calculated based on the albedo index with the best relationship obtained, and constructing a linear relationship between albedo changes and mass balance retrieved by Brun et al., 2017 using the DEM method. Glacier mass balance in HMA is calculated from 2000 to 2020 from the constructed linear relationship.

The study shows that except for five regions, W Kunlun, E Kunlun, Qilian Shan, Inner Tibet and W Himalaya, the remaining 11 regions all have negative glacier mass balance, with an average glacier mass change of−0.225 ± 0.040 m w.e.a−1 from 2000 to 2020.",
