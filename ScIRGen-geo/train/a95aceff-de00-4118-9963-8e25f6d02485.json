            "description": "The station data information of 21 regular meteorological observation stations in Heihe River Basin and surrounding areas and 13 national benchmark stations around Heihe River provided by Heihe plan data management center are used to make statistics and collation of daily wind speed and calculate the monthly wind speed data of 1961-2010 for many years. The spatial stability analysis is carried out to calculate the variation coefficient. If the variation coefficient is greater than 100%, the geographical weighted regression is used to calculate the relationship between the station and the geographical terrain factors, and the monthly wind speed distribution trend is obtained; if the variation coefficient is less than or equal to 100%, the common least square regression is used to calculate the relationship between the station wind speed value and the geographical terrain factors (longitude and latitude, elevation, slope, aspect, etc.) The trend of monthly wind speed distribution is obtained, and the residual after removing the trend is fitted and corrected by HASM (high accuracy surface modeling method). Finally, the monthly average wind speed distribution of the Heihe River Basin in 1961-2010 is obtained by adding the trend surface results and the residual correction results. Time resolution: monthly average wind speed for many years from 1961 to 2010. Spatial resolution: 500M.",

                    "Answer": "Geographic weighted regression is a spatial analysis technique used to explore relationships between variables and their geographical context. In analyzing wind speed data, it is applied when the coefficient of variation exceeds 100%, to calculate the relationship between wind speed at meteorological stations and geographic terrain factors, such as latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, and aspect, thus determining the trend of monthly wind speed distribution.",

If the coefficient of variation is high, geographic weighted regression helps in understanding the spatial distribution trend of wind speeds. Otherwise, ordinary least squares regression can be employed to evaluate the connection between wind speed values and geographical factors. These methods allow researchers to discern underlying patterns and influences in the wind speed data over the decades, ultimately providing insights into the spatial distribution and trends of wind speeds in the region studied.",

                    "Answer": "The variability in wind speed data collection across different meteorological stations in the Heihe River Basin may be influenced by several factors, including the geographic and topographic characteristics like latitude, elevation, slope, and aspect. The spatial stability of wind speed data is analyzed through the calculation of the coefficient of variation. If the coefficient of variation exceeds 100%, a geographically weighted regression is used to calculate the relationship between station data and geographic topographic factors to determine the monthly wind speed distribution trend. If it is less than or equal to 100%, ordinary least squares regression is employed. Additionally, the residuals after removing the trend are fitted and corrected using the High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method (HASM) for more accurate distribution results.",

This involves calculating the distribution trend of monthly wind speed over a multi-year period, identifying spatial variations, and refining the results through methods like High Accuracy Surface Modeling to achieve an accurate representation of wind speed distribution from 1961 to 2010 at a spatial resolution of 500 meters.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves obtaining daily wind speed data from 21 conventional meteorological observation stations and 13 national benchmark stations around the Heihe River Basin. The data is statistically organized to compute long-term monthly average wind speed for each station from 1961 to 2010. Spatial stationarity analysis is conducted by calculating the coefficient of variation. If the coefficient is greater than 100%, geographically weighted regression is used to determine the relationship between station data and geographical and topographical factors, establishing monthly wind speed distribution trends. If the coefficient is 100% or less, ordinary least squares regression is used for the same purpose. Residuals after trend removal are corrected using the High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method (HASM). Finally, the trend surface results and corrected residuals are combined to obtain the spatial distribution of long-term monthly average wind speed from 1961 to 2010, with a spatial resolution of 500 meters.",
