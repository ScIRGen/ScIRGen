            "description": "一.An overview\nThe 1:100,000 soil database in the upper reaches of the Yellow River was tailored from the 1:100,000 soil database in China.The 1:100,000 soil database of China is based on the 1:100,000 soil map of the People's Republic of China compiled and published by the national soil census office in 1995.The database adopts the traditional \"soil genetic classification\" system, and the basic mapping unit is subcategories, which are divided into 12 classes of soil, 61 classes of soil and 227 classes of soil, covering all kinds of soil and its main attribute data in China.\n二. Data processing instructions\nThe 1:1 million soil database of China was established by the soil resources and digital management innovation research team led by shi xuezheng of nanjing soil research institute, Chinese academy of sciences, after four years.The database consists of two parts: soil spatial database and soil attribute database.The establishment of the database was funded by the knowledge innovation program of the Chinese academy of sciences and completed under the leadership of liu jiyuan and zhuang dafang.\n三. data content description\nThe soil spatial database, 1:1 million digitized soil maps of the country, is based on the 1:1 million soil maps of the People's Republic of China compiled and published by the national census offices in 1995.The digitized soil map faithfully reflects the appearance of the original soil map and inherited the mapping unit when the original soil map was compiled. Most of the basic mapping units are soil genera, which are divided into 12 classes, 61 classes and 235 subclasses. It is the only and most detailed digitized soil map in China.\nThe soil attribute database, whose attribute data is quoted from the soil species record of China, is divided into six volumes, and nearly 2,540 soil species are collected.Soil property data can be divided into soil physical properties, soil chemical properties and soil nutrients.Soil physical properties soil particle composition and soil texture, soil chemical properties such as PH value, organic matter, soil nutrients include all N, all P, all K and effective P and effective K.\n四. Data usage instructions\nSoil types and soil properties are an important content in the study of physical geography. With the help of 1:100,000 soil database in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the type, quantity and spatial distribution of soil resources in the upper reaches of the Yellow River as well as the soil environment and characteristics can be understood and analyzed.This data set is of great significance for the early warning of large-scale soil erosion and the prediction of natural disasters in the upper reaches of the Yellow River.",
            "instructions": "File name: data is stored in vector SHP format. The file name is \"ysoil. SHP\", which stands for soil data in the upper reaches of the Yellow River.Properties are stored in the form of an MDB database, with the file name \"soil properties database. MDB\", which contains property data of the soil in the upper reaches of the Yellow River.\nData reading mode: vector data SHP can open and read spatial data and properties with Arcgis, Qgis and other software;The MDB database can be opened by office.",

                    "Answer": "The classification system used in a soil dataset, such as the 'soil genesis classification' system, influences the understanding of soil distribution by providing a structured framework to categorize soil types. This system, which divides soils into 12 orders, 61 suborders, and 227 subcategories, allows researchers to systematically analyze soil diversity and its spatial distribution. Understanding these patterns can help infer environmental implications, such as soil fertility, erosion risks, and the potential for agricultural productivity, thereby aiding in environmental management and planning.",

The database is divided into a soil spatial database and a soil attribute database, which incorporates data from the '中国土种志'. The spatial database represents a digital soil map that maintains the original map's cartographic units, while the attribute database includes data on soil physical properties, chemical properties, and nutrients.",
