The dataset was produced based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method by fusing six satellite-derived evapotranspiration products including RS-PM (Mu et al., 2011), SW (Shuttleworth and Wallace., 1985), PT-JPL (Fisher et al., 2008), MS-PT (Yao et al., 2013), SEMI-PM (Wang et al., 2010a) and SIM (Wang et al.2008). The input variables for the evapotranspiration products include MODIS products, MERRA meteorological data, and China Meteorological Forcing Dataset.",

In contrast, MERRA-2 meteorological reanalysis data provide atmospheric data with potentially coarser spatial resolution but integrate a wide range of atmospheric variables.

Additionally, the integration process must effectively handle the discrepancies in input data sources like MODIS, MERRA-2, and regional meteorological datasets while maintaining the precision of the product's resolution at 0.01°.",
