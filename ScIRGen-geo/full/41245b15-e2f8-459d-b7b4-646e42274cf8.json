            "description": "On 25 July 2012, Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a LiDAR airborne optical remote sensing experiment. Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner has unlimited numbers of returns intensities measurements including the first, second ,third return intensities. The wavelength of laser light is 1064 nm. The absolute flight altitude is 5500 m with the point cloud density 1 points per square meter. Airborne LiDAR-DEM and DSM data production were obtained through parameter calibration, automatic classification of point cloud density and manual editing.",

                    "Answer": "Lidar aerial remote sensing in the context of ecological hydrology experiments refers to the technique of using laser scanning technology from an aircraft to gather detailed information about a landscape. In this case, it involves using an aircraft equipped with a Leica ALS70 system to conduct lidar surveys, capturing data at a laser wavelength of 1064nm with multiple return echoes (1,2,3, and last). The data collection is performed at different absolute flight altitudes, resulting in a point cloud density of 1 point per square meter, which is then processed through calibration, automatic classification, and manual editing to produce digital surface models (DSM) and digital elevation models (DEM).",

The use of specialized equipment, such as the Leica ALS70 with a wavelength of 1064nm and multiple echo capabilities, highlights the technological rigor required. The division of the study area into different flight altitudes and the execution of lidar flights at absolute altitudes of 4800 and 5500 meters suggest careful planning to optimize data capture. Additionally, the creation of DSM and DEM data products from the point cloud data involves parameter calibration, automatic classification, and manual editing, indicating a comprehensive approach to ensuring data quality and reliability.",

                    "Answer": "Using airborne LiDAR systems like the ALS70 can result in high-accuracy DSM and DEM data products due to the detailed point cloud density achieved (1 point/m²). However, variations in flight altitudes (4800 and 5500 meters) may affect the resolution and accuracy of the landscape representation, as higher altitudes might lead to less dense point clouds, potentially impacting the precision of terrain modeling, especially in complex topographies like the Hulugou area.",
