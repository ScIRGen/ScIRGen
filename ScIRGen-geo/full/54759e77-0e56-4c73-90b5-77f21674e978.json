            "description": "Data overview: from September 23 to September 30, 2005 and from November 5 to November 9, 2005, the remote sensing Office of hanhanyuan Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences measured 21 hydrological sections between Yingluoxia hydrological station and zhengzhengxia hydrological station in the middle reaches of Heihe River. \nData acquisition process: using two sets of zhonghaida hd8080 GPS receivers and one set of DS3 level of Southern surveying and mapping company, combining GPS and leveling. Section survey mainly includes two steps. Firstly, two differential GPS are used to select high-precision control points on both sides of the river bank or on one side of the selected section, and two GPS receivers are used to observe for 30 minutes simultaneously. Then, on the basis of these control points, the level is used for continuous measurement of the section. According to the river width, a certain number of sounding plumb lines are arranged on the section to measure the water depth and the starting point distance of each sounding plumb line. The measuring points are relatively dense in the main channel part, and the beach is relatively sparse. The distance between the two points of the main channel part is 2m. This data can provide the key basic data for the hydrological simulation of surface groundwater in the middle reaches of Heihe River.",
