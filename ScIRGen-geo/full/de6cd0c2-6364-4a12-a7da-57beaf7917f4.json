            "description": "Surface melting is the primary reason that affects the mass balance of Greenland ice sheet. At the same time, ice and snow have high albedo, and  ice sheet surface melting will cause the difference of radiation energy budget, and then affects the energy exchange between sea-land-air. The high-resolution ice sheet surface melting product provides important information support for the study of Greenland ice sheet surface melting and its response to global climate change. This dataset combined microwave radiometer product and optical albedo product, the daily, winter (June-August) averages and July averages of the former are used for layer-stacking, then Gram-Schmidt Spectral Sharpening was adapted to fuse the layer-stacking results with MODIS GLASS albedo product. The spatial resolution of fusion-results has been downscaled from 25 km to 0.05˚. By employing a threshold-based melt detection approach for each fusion-results pixel, Greenland ice sheet surface melt daily product for 1985, 2000, 2015 (DSSMIS) was generated. The spatial resolution of DSSMIS is higher than that of published data sets at home and abroad. Combined with the advantages of radiometer and albedo data, the spatial details characteristics are enhanced and consistent with the extraction range of the original radiometer products, effectively reducing the noise of the radiometer. DSSMIS’s data type is integer, where 1 is melted, 0 is not melted, 255 is masked area besides Greenland ice sheet, and the data set is stored as *.nc.",
            "instructions": "File name: the surface melting data is stored in NC format. The file name is \"antarcticcdailysurfacemeltyyyy-yyyy. NC\", where yyyy-yyyy represents the year. For example, ‘antarcticcdailysurfacemelt1985-1986.nc’ represents the NC file, which describes the surface melting range of the Antarctic ice sheet from July 1, 1985 to June 30, 1986. The NC file contains four variables: melt and polar_ Stereographic, x and y, respectively represent the melting pixel value, coordinate system information, X coordinate and Y coordinate in the projection coordinate system.\n\nData reading method: all NC files in the dataset can be directly read by panoply program （https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/download/ ）, select the variable melt , create the XY coordinate axis corresponding to the variable x and variable y for browsing, and change the time to browse the melting range of different dates. If you want to save it as a separate picture for display or analysis, you can use the \"multidimensional tool - create NetCDF grid layer\" tool in ArcGIS program to process the results and generate a file in TIF format, including the melting range of all days in the corresponding year. You can change the display time by opening \"enable time in this layer\" in the \"attribute - time\" tab. In addition, you can also select GDAL, NCO, CDO and other tools to open NC files or convert them to other formats.",

                "Understanding surface melt over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is important for evaluating the effect of the changing global climate on humanity, and for forecasting sea level rise. Global sea levels are rising, and current predictions suggest that the rate of sea level rise will continue to accelerate. Mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) currently contributes about 0.72 mm/yr to global sea level rise, and along with Antarctica, is predicted to become the dominant contributor to global sea level rise within the century. The mass balance quantifies the total mass change of the GrIS and is directly proportional to mean global sea level. It has been shown that the rate of GrIS mass loss is increasing and could contribute to 7-21 cm increase in Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) by the end of the century. Both the Surface Mass Balance (SMB) and glacier discharge (ice deposited from outlet glaciers directly into the ocean) contribute significantly to the mass balance of the GrIS, and the two are correlated. The SMB includes positive mass contributions from precipitation as well as loss due to evaporation and sublimation in addition to the dominant meltwater runoff loss. Current forecasts, which include uncertainties in basal friction, the lubrication of discharging ice, suggest large uncertainty in the future Greenland mass balance. Accurate knowledge of the current state of the GrIS SMB is thus imperative to predict the possible rate of future global sea level rise. Surface mass loss is expected to increase significantly in the 21st century, compared to discharge, and the SMB is the dominant contributor to uncertainty in GMSL predictions. One of the most direct methods of measuring mass change is by gravimetry from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. GRACE-derived estimates have their own sources of uncertainty, particularly glacier isostatic adjustment or postglacial rebound and tidal aliasing. Also GRACE measurements typically need more than 5 years of integration to achieve sufficiently accurate estimates of GrIS mass-change. Mass balance can also be studied from laser or radar altimetry but these techniques also have uncertainties introduced by the required knowledge on density distribution over the GrIS. Satellite data have been used to map surface melt on the GrIS, particularly passive microwave, radar backscatter, and visible imagery. However, these methods only provide maps of binary information on melt versus non-melt, and are unable to provide quantitative information about volumetric liquid water. In Houtz et al. (2019) a new method was introduced for the simultaneous retrieval of snow/firn mass-density and snow liquid water content from passive L-band radiometry."

In this study, we expand corresponding retrievals to the entire GrIS, and show: density, liquid water column, and integrated surface liquid water estimates. We show that liquid water column, down to the penetration depth of L-band microwaves, can be calculated from SMOS-based retrievals using a physically deterministic Emission Model (EM). By integrating retrieved liquid water over time and area we estimate the volume of melt water on the GrIS as a function of time and as an annual total. We discuss how this quantified total melt water relates to the GrIS surface mass loss and thus to the SMB, and we also discuss the limitations of the algorithm and uncertainty contributions."

We also only consider a period in the assumed dry snow period (the first 90 Days of the Year (DoY)) in which we assume the firn/snow to be dry, as surface wetness can significantly increase the firn/snow permittivity and therefore change the Brewster angle. For a SMOS orbit i the instantaneous water column at a single pixel Wc, i can be calculated as: Wc , i = WS ⋅ twet. The instantaneous water column Wc, i can now be summed over all observations, and normalized by the number of observations, to obtain annual (yr) liquid water column Wc, yr. The value of Wc, yr is computed for each GrIS pixel on the SMOS Equal-Area Scalable Earth version 2.0 grid (EASE-grid 2.0) (Brodzik et al. 2012)."
