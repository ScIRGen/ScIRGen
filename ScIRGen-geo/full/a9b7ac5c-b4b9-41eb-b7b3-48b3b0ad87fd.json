                    "Answer": "Landsat remote sensing data refers to satellite imagery collected by the Landsat program, which is used to observe and record the Earth's surface. In the context of cataloging glacial lakes, it involves using this imagery to identify and measure glacial lakes in a specific region, such as Nepal, particularly those with an area greater than 0.01 km² as of the year 2000.",

                    "Answer": "The cataloging of ice lakes using Landsat remote sensing data aims to reflect the status of ice lakes larger than 0.01 km2 in the Nepal region as of 2000. This effort is supported by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the United Nations Environment Programme/Regional Resources Centre for Asia and the Pacific (UNEP/RRC-AP) to effectively monitor and manage the geographical and environmental attributes of ice lakes.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures for using Landsat remote sensing data include selecting appropriate imagery that reflects the current state of glacial lakes, ensuring that the lakes have an area greater than 0.01 km², and covering the specific region of interest, such as Nepal. The data should be processed with the correct projection information, using Lambert conformal conic projection, Everest (India 1956) ellipsoid, and India datum. Proper preprocessing steps include setting the scale factor and standard parallels, and ensuring the data is within the specified minimum and maximum X and Y values for the grid zones.",
