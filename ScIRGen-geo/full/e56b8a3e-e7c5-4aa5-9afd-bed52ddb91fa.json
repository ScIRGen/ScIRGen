            "description": "This data includes whole-rock major and trace geochemical data, zircon major elements data, and whole-rock Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition data. The samples were collected from the Kangba dome in southern Tibet. The major elements in the whole rock were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) glass melting sheet method; The trace elements in the whole rock were dissolved by mixed acid dissolution method and tested by Quadrupole Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICPMS); The major elements of zircon were analyzed by electron microprobe; For the analysis of Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition of the whole rock, the accurate content of three elements is determined by quadrupole ICP-MS, and then the isotopic ratio is determined by MC-ICP-MS. The data obtained show that Kangba leucogranite is crystallized from highly evolved magma that has experienced strong crystallization differentiation. Strong hydrothermal exsolution has occurred in the diagenetic process, and the isotopes of the magmatic system have migrated to varying degrees in the process of hydrothermal fluid. It is also obviously contaminated by the surrounding rock.",

Additionally, Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions are determined by quadrupole ICP-MS for accurate elemental content and multi-collector ICP-MS (MC-ICP-MS) for isotopic ratios.",
