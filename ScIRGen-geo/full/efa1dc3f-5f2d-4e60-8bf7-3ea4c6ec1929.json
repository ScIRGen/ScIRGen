            "description": "The data from the Digital Mountain Map of China depicts the spatial pattern and complex morphological characteristics of mountains in China from a macro scale, including the mountains’ spatial distribution, classification, morphological elements and area ratio. It is a set of basic data that can be used for mountain zoning, mountain genetic classification and resource environment correlation analysis. \nMountains carry great natural resource supply, provide ecological service and regulation functions, and play an important part in eco-civilization construction and socioeconomic development in China. Lately，Prof. Li Ainong of the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS, developed this data set based on the spatial definition of mountains, an a topography adaptive slide window method for the relief amplitude. The data include:\n(1) Spatial distribution of mountains in China; (2) Mountain classification; (3) Main mountain ranges (with range alignment, relief grade and ridge morphology); (4)Main mountain peaks; (5)Mountain proportion table of the provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities of China; (6) Contour zoning data; (7) General situation of mountain formation; (8)Mountain division and zoning data; (9) List of main mountain peaks. The spatial resolution of the original DEM source is about 90m. And the boundaries of mountains have been revised with multisource remote sensing data, which has good spatial consistency with the relief shading map. The cartographic generalization accuracy of mountain ranges and relevant features is 1:1 000 000. Mountain features in this data set have higher spatial resolution and pertinence, which are available for the zonality of mountain environment and mountain hazards, and the spatial analysis for ecological, production and living spaces in mountain areas, surpporting macro decision-making on mountain areas' development in China.\np",
