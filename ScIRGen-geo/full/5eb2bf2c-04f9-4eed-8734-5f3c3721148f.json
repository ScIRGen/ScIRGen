            "description": "This data set is based on the lightning location data calculation of TBB products, cloud classification (CLC) products and world wide lightning location network (wwlln) in the full disk area detected by fy-2e satellite (fy-2e) from 2010 to 2018 to establish the lightning storm cloud feature data set. The algorithm used for wwlln lightning clustering is DBSCAN algorithm. According to Hutchins et al. (2014), it is required that the number of lightning in each lightning cluster in the thunderstorm cloud is greater than 2 and all fall within the radius of 12 km. The data set includes thunderstorm cloud time and location information, thunderstorm cloud shape (long, short axis, rotation angle, etc.) information represented by fitting ellipse, cloud area representing thunderstorm cloud structure, statistical value of black body temperature (TBB), included flash information, and included strong convection core, lightning cluster information and other data information.",
            "instructions": "File naming: it is stored in the structure data format of mat format data. The file name is \"yyyymmdd_hhmm.mat\", and yyyymmddhhmm respectively represents the time corresponding to the data (universal time, UTC): year, month, day, hour, minute, for example, 20100112_ 0000 means 0:00 on January 12, 2010.\nData reading method: the format of data file is mat file, which is a standard binary file and the standard format of MATLAB data storage. When reading data, you can directly use matlab to read. Some codes for data reading are as follows:\n%Reading of single parameter\nfilepath=’\\dataset\\YYYY\\YYYYMMDD_ hhmm. mat’;% Data path\nload(path);% Open the data file\nArea=TSC(1). Area；% Read the area of the first thunderstorm cloud\nWWLLN_ lon=TSC(1). WWLLNstroke(:,8); % Read the longitude information of all lightning in the first thunderstorm cloud\nS52_ Area=TSC(1). S52(2).

These processes must ensure that each lightning cluster within a thunderstorm cloud contains more than two lightning events within a 12 km radius, which requires precise and consistent data collection and processing methods.",
