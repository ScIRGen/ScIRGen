            "description": "The land use / land cover data set of Heihe River Basin in 2011 is the Remote Sensing Research Office of Institute of cold and drought of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the remote sensing data of landsatm and ETM in 2011, combined with field investigation and verification, a 1:100000 land use / land cover image and vector database of Heihe River Basin is established.            \nThe data set mainly includes 1:100000 land use graph data and attribute data in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin.            \nThe land cover data of 1:100000 (2011) in Heihe River Basin and the previous land cover are classified into six first-class categories (cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, urban and rural residents, industrial and mining land and unused land) and 25 second-class categories by the same hierarchical land cover classification system. The data type is vector polygon and stored in shape format.\nLand cover classification attributes:            \nLevel 1 type     level 2 type     attribute code      spatial distribution location            \nCultivated land: plain dry land 123 is mainly distributed in basin, piedmont, river alluvial, proluvial or lacustrine plain (poor irrigation conditions due to water shortage).            \nThe upland and land 122 is mainly distributed in the hilly area, and generally, the plot is distributed on the gentle slope of the hill, as well as on the top of the ridge and the base.            \nThe dry land 121 is mainly distributed in the mountainous area, the hillside (gentle slope, hillside, steep slope platform, etc.) and the Piedmont belt below 4000 m above sea level.            \nWoodland: there are woodland (Arbor) 21 mainly distributed in high mountains (below 4000 meters above sea level) or middle mountain slopes, valley slopes, mountain tops, plains, etc.            \nShrub land 22 is mainly distributed in the higher mountain area (below 4500m), most of which are hillside, valley and sandy land.            \nSparse forest land 23 is mainly distributed in mountainous areas, hills, plains and sandy land, Gobi (Loamy, sandy conglomerate) edge.            \nOther forest lands 24 are mainly distributed around the oasis ridge, riverside, roadside and rural residential areas.            \nGrassland: high cover grassland 31 is generally distributed in mountainous area (gentle slope), hilly area (steep slope), river beach, Gobi, sandy land, etc.            \nThe middle cover grassland 32 is mainly distributed in dry areas (low-lying land next door and land between Sandy Hills, etc.).            \nLow cover grassland 33 mainly grows in dry areas (loess hills and sand edge).            \nWater area: channel 41 is mainly distributed in plain, inter Sichuan cultivated land and inter mountain valley.            \nLake 42 is mainly distributed in low-lying areas.            \nReservoir pond 43 is mainly distributed in plain and valley between rivers, surrounded by residential land and cultivated land.            \nGlaciers and permanent snow cover 44 are mainly distributed on the top of (over 4000) mountains.            \nThe beach land 46 is mainly distributed in the valley, piedmont, plain lowland, the edge of river lake basin and so on.            \nResidential land: urban land 51 is mainly distributed in plain, mountain basin, slope and gully platform.            \nRural residential land 52 is mainly distributed in oasis, cultivated land and roadside, tableland, slope, etc.            \nIndustrial and mining land and traffic land 53 are generally distributed in the periphery of cities and towns, more developed traffic areas and industrial mining areas.            \nUnused land: sand 61 is mostly distributed in the basin, both sides of the river, the river bay and the periphery of the mountain front Gobi.            \nGobi 62 is mainly distributed in the Piedmont belt with strong wind erosion and sediment transport.            \nSalt alkali 63 is mainly distributed in relatively low and easy to accumulate water, dry lakes and lakeside.            \nSwamp 64 is mainly distributed in relatively low and easy to accumulate water.            \nBare soil 65 is mainly distributed in the arid areas (mountain steep slopes, hills, Gobi), and the vegetation coverage is less than 5%.            \nBare rock 66 is mainly distributed in the extremely dry stone mountain area (windy, light rain).            \nThe other 67 are mainly distributed in the exposed rocks formed by freezing and thawing over 4000 meters, also known as alpine tundra.\nProjection parameters:\nProjection ALBERS\nUnits METERS\nSpheroid Krasovsky\nParameters:\n25 00 0.000 /* 1st standard parallel\n47 00 0.000 /* 2nd standard parallel\n105 00 0.000 /* central meridian\n0 0 0.000 /* latitude of projection's origin\n0.00000 /* false easting (meters)\n0.00000 /* false northing (meters)",

                "The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is a typical arid inland river basin in northwestern China. The water from the Heihe River is important to agricultural production and ecosystem stabilization in the middle and lower reaches of the HRB and is highly sensitive to climate change and human activities in the area. Human activities have therefore become the dominant driver of changes in the water resources of the HRB over the last 60 years. With large-scale developments in the use of both water and land resources, human-induced water shortages have become a serious environmental, economic and social problem. To prevent further ecosystem deterioration and to restore the environment in the lower reaches, the Chinese Government implemented the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP) in 2000."

                "A substantial increase in the farmland inevitably led to the over-extraction of groundwater and a transfer of water from ecosystems. The over-extraction of groundwater has resulted in declining groundwater levels in particular areas of the middle reaches. The declining groundwater levels and the reduction in ecological water led to the reduction of shrub forests and an increase in grassland desertification in particular areas of the middle reaches. In the field survey, we found that a large area of Elaeagnus forest exhibited drought stress or partial die-out in the tree farms of Jiulong Jiang. This effect was probably due to declining groundwater levels and ecological water. The expansion of farmland areas in the middle reaches will present a severe challenge for local governments when continuous low-flow years occur. This trend may also threaten the sustainability of the entire river basin."

The farmland expansion increased the water resource stress; thus, groundwater was over-extracted and the ecosystem was degraded in particular areas.
