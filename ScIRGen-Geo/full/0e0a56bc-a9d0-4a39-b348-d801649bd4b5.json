      "description": "The long-term evolution of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) could be observed from Landsat series of satellite data since the 1970s. However, the seasonal cycles of lakes on the TP have received little attention due to high cloud contamination of the commonly-used optical images. In this study, for the first time, the seasonal cycle of lakes on the TP were detected using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with a high repeat cycle. A total of approximately 6000 Level-1 scenes were obtained that covered all large lakes (> 50 km2) in the study area. The images were extracted from stripmap (SM) and interferometric wide swath (IW) modes that had a pixel spacing of 40 m in the range and azimuth directions. The lake boundaries extracted from Sentinel-1 data using the algorithm developed in this study were in good agreement with in-situ measurements of lake shoreline, lake outlines delineated from the corresponding Landsat images in 2015 and lake levels for Qinghai Lake. Upon analysis, it was found that the seasonal cycles of lakes exhibited drastically different patterns across the TP. For example, large size lakes (> 100 km2) reached their peaks in August−September while lakes with areas of 50−100 km2 reached their peaks in early June−July. The peaks of seasonal cycles for endorheic lakes were more pronounced than those for exorheic lakes with flat peaks, and glacier-fed lakes with additional supplies of water exhibited delayed peaks in their seasonal cycles relative to those of non-glacier-fed lakes. Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as the westerlies, Indian summer monsoon, transition in between, and East Asian summer monsoon, were also found to affect the seasonal cycles of lakes. The results of this study suggest that Sentinel-1 SAR data are a powerful tool that can be used to fill gaps in intra-annual lake observations.",
      "descriptionCn": "青藏高原由于高云覆盖，通常用来监测湖泊面积的光学遥感影像数据，如Landsat只能用来监测湖泊年尺度面积变化，而对湖泊季节变化研究了解较少。使用Sentinel-1 SAR数据，对青藏高原大于50平方公里湖泊月尺度面积进行了提取。研究显示，湖泊的季节变化显示出截然不同的模式，面积较大的湖泊（> 100 km2）在8-9月达到峰值，而较小的湖泊（50-100 km2）面积在6-7月达到峰值。封闭湖泊面积的季节峰值更突出，而外流湖的季节峰值更平缓。冰川补给湖相对于非冰川补给湖显示了延迟的面积峰值。同时，大尺度的大气环流，如西风、印度季风、和东亚季风也影响着湖泊面积的季节变化。此研究为监测湖泊面积年内变化弥补了空白。",

The SAR data provides the capability to observe under cloud cover, offering more frequent and reliable data for understanding seasonal dynamics.
