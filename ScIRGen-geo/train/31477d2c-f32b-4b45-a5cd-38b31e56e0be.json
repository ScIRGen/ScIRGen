            "description": "This data set includes major and trace elements and zircon U-Pb isotope data of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in Baoshan block, Tengchong, Yunnan Province. The sampling time is 2018, and the area is near lameng Town, Baoshan District, Tengchong, Yunnan. The rock samples include 8 sedimentary rock samples. This data provides key information for understanding the evolution of the middle Tethys structure between Tengchong and Baoshan, and limits the closing time of the middle Tethys ocean to the late Jurassic, which is of great significance for discussing the evolution process of the Tethys structure. The whole rock major and trace elements of rock samples were tested by fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), and zircon U-Pb was dated by laser ablation plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS). The testing units include Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Institute of Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The related articles of this data set have been published in the Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, and the data results are true and reliable.",

                    "Answer": "锆石U-Pb定年 refers to a dating method used to determine the age of zircon minerals within rock samples by measuring the ratios of uranium to lead isotopes. In geological data collection, this technique is carried out using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and it provides crucial information regarding the timing of tectonic events, such as the closure of the Tethys Ocean during the Late Jurassic period.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of techniques like XRF, ICP-MS, and LA-ICP-MS is influenced by the need for accurate measurement of major and trace elements and precise zircon U-Pb dating. These methods provide crucial data for understanding the tectonic evolution of areas like the Tengchong-Baoshan block in Yunnan and help constrain the closure time of the Meso-Tethys Ocean to the Late Jurassic, offering significant insights into the Tethyan tectonic evolution.",

                    "Answer": "Using multiple analytical techniques like XRF, ICP-MS, and LA-ICP-MS allows for comprehensive data collection on major and trace elements as well as isotope dating, which can lead to a more detailed and accurate understanding of the Tethyan tectonic evolution. This approach can help constrain the closure time of the Meso-Tethys Ocean to the Late Jurassic, providing critical insights into the tectonic processes in the Tengchong-Baoshan block in Yunnan, thereby enhancing the overall understanding of Tethys evolution.",

                    "Answer": "The instrumental and procedural steps for collecting and analyzing zircon U-Pb isotopic data include sampling sedimentary rock from the target region, such as near Laimeng Town in the Tengchong Baoshan area. The collected rock samples are then analyzed for major and trace elements using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For zircon U-Pb dating, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is employed. Challenges in this process may include ensuring accurate sample preparation, avoiding contamination, and obtaining precise measurements from the instruments involved.",
