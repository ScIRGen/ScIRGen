                    "Answer": "In the Heihe River Basin, data collection for annual ecological surveys in various desert types involves setting up observation sites in eight distinct areas, including mountain-front desert, mountain-front gobi, midstream desert, midstream gobi, midstream sand desert, downstream desert, downstream gobi, and downstream desert. Each site is 40m x 40m, where three fixed 20m x 20m large plots, named S1, S2, and S3, are used for periodic shrub surveys. Additionally, each large plot contains four fixed 5m x 5m small plots, named A, B, C, and D, for herbaceous plant surveys.",

                    "Answer": "An 'annual ecological survey' refers to a systematic study conducted at the end of the growing season, typically in late September to early October, to assess and record the ecological characteristics and conditions of vegetation in various types of deserts. This involves establishing observation plots, performing regular shrub surveys in larger plots, and conducting herbaceous surveys in smaller plots across multiple sites with different desert classifications.",

                    "Answer": "The design of the systematic surveying method is influenced by the need to conduct comprehensive ecological investigations across different desert types, including mountain-front desert, mountain-front gobi, mid-stream desert, mid-stream gobi, mid-stream sandy desert, downstream desert, downstream gobi, and downstream desert. Each observation field is structured into 40m×40m plots, with further subdivisions into 20m×20m major sample plots for shrub investigations and 5m×5m minor sample plots for herbaceous plant investigations. This structure allows for consistent, detailed ecological data collection across varied desert environments.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of conducting annual ecological surveys in different desert types along the Heihe River Basin is to understand the ecological dynamics and vegetation patterns across various environments, including mountain front deserts, mountain front gobi, midstream deserts, midstream gobi, midstream deserts, downstream deserts, downstream gobi, and downstream deserts. These surveys aim to capture changes in vegetation by examining both shrubs and herbaceous plants in designated plots, thereby contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the region's ecological status.",

                    "Answer": "To conduct periodic shrub surveys in diverse desert types, each of the 8 observation fields, including various desert and gobi types across upstream, midstream, and downstream regions, is structured with fixed large sample plots measuring 20m×20m named S1, S2, and S3. In these plots, regular surveys are conducted to monitor shrubs.",
