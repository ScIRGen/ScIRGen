This data set can also be used to force macro-scale hydrological and dynamic vegetation model in the region. The procedure to generate the data set is based on Cuo et al. (2013) published in Journal of Climate. The source data collected to generate the gridded data set come from China Meteorological Agency and NOAA-GHCND. In total, 446, 435, 966 and 427 stations were used to generate grids of temperature maxima, temperature minima, precipitation, and wind speed, respectively. The area coverage of the data set is 24.125-41.875N，69.625-105.875E.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) exerts significant influence on regional and global climate through thermal and mechanical forcing. As a headwater region of the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong Rivers, the northern Tibetan Plateau (NTP) provides water for more than a billion people and numerous ecosystems in China and Southeast Asia. Near-surface air temperature increases in the recent decades have been documented over the TP based primarily on isolated station observations. Changes in precipitation over the TP, however, do not show consistent and plateau-wide trends both temporally and spatially. The lack of consistent trends in station records of precipitation likely reflects the consequences of multiple drivers acting in numerous ways and differentially affecting climatic variability in various parts of the region. Gridded data interpolated from station observations can be used to examine regional climate change in a more spatiotemporally complete manner than is generally possible with station records alone. Over the TP, with a surface area larger than Greenland and complex terrain, it is often challenging to generate gridded climate data of good quality."
