            "description": "This data set is daily land surface BRDF kernel coefficients product over Tibet plateau region from 2002 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0.0042° x0.0042°. The MODIS reflectance data product was used to retrieve the Extended Multi-Sensor Combined BRDF Inversion (EMCBI) Model which has coupled with topographic effects with assistance of a BRDF priori-knowledge. The daily BRDF was retrieved in a 5-day period to collect multi-angular information from MODIS observations. MODIS landsurface reflectance data (MOD09GA and MYD09GA) are downloaded from the official website. the daily resolution BRDF is synthesized with a period of 5 days. Compared with similar products, it has more advantages in capturing rapidly changing surface features, and has better temporal and spatial continuity with the shortest composition period. It can effectively support angular effects correction and the BRDF-related parameters' retrieval.",
