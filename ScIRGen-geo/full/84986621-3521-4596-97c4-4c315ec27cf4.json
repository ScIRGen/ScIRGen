                "The Tibetan Plateau includes, from north to south, the Qiangtang, Lhasa, and Himalaya terranes, and has a complex geological history. The Lhasa terrane is an important constituent of the Tibetan Plateau, and underwent a complicated series of subduction events during the formation and consumption of the Neo-Tethys and the subsequent collision between India and Asia. The early Mesozoic igneous rocks in the southern Lhasa subterrane previously regard as a result of southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic lithosphere. In recent years, however, there are growing evidences that they formed in northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan slab. The Sangri Group, which is found within the central–eastern segment of the southern Lhasa subterrane, is important because it is regarded as a product of early Neo-Tethyan subduction. The volcanic–sedimentary sequence of the Sangri Group is irregularly distributed within the central–eastern segment of the southern Lhasa subterrane, where it trends E–W for ~800 km from Sangri to Saga counties. The characteristics of the sedimentary sequence and types of fossils indicate that the Sangri Group was deposited in a nearshore or shallow sea environment on a continental shelf. The volcanic rocks of the Mamuxia Formation are a 1500-m-thick sequence of basaltic andesites, andesites, and dacites with adakite-like geochemical signatures."
