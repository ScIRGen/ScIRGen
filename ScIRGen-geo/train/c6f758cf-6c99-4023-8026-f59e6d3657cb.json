            "description": "This is a monthly grided dataset (1°×1°) of the oceanic moisture contributions to precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau during 1979–2015, which was produced by using the atmospheric reanalysis product to drive the forward Eulerian moisture tracking model (WAM-2). We tracked the evaporation from global oceans (‘oceans’ in Masks.nc), the western oceans dominated by the westerlies (‘western oceans’ in Masks.nc), and the Indian Ocean dominated by the Indian monsoon (‘indian ocean’ in Masks.nc), and quantified their contributions to precipitation over the plateau from two aspects: absolute contribution (mm, equivalent water height in each grid) and relative contribution (%, ratio of oceanic moisture contribution to each grid). Due to date uncertainties, we used three high-resolution global atmospheric reanalysis products (ERA-I, MERRA2, and JRA55) in the moisture tracking, and we suggest the users of this dataset pay attention to the uncertainties among the different simulations.",
            "instructions": "The dataset is stored in nc format. 'Oceanic moisture contribution_ ERA-I.nc' is the dataset of oceanic moisture contribution simulated by WAM-2 driven by ERA-I. Therein, the variables ‘oceans_*’, ‘western_ oceans_*’ and ‘indian_ ocean_*’ represent the moisture contributions from global oceans, the western oceans, and the Indian Ocean, respectively. The variables ‘*_absolute’ and ‘*_relative’ represent the absolute and relative moisture contribution. For example, the variable ‘indian_ocean_absolute’ represents the absolute contribution of moisture from the Indian Ocean. ‘Masks.nc’ contains the mask data of the global oceans, the western oceans and the Indian Ocean used in the moisture tracking simulations.",

Water vapor evaporation from global oceanic source regions, including areas dominated by westerlies (western oceans) and the monsoon-driven Indian Ocean, is tracked. The contribution of this vapor to precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau is quantified in terms of absolute contribution (equivalent water height in mm) and relative contribution (percentage contribution). The procedure employs three high-resolution global atmospheric reanalysis datasets (ERA-I, MERRA2, and JRA55) to account for uncertainties, and it is recommended to consider differences in results from these datasets.",
