                    "Answer": "Data collection using digital soil mapping methods, as applied to the Heihe River Basin, involves creating spatial distribution maps for key hydrological parameters based on soil-landscape models and enhanced regression tree predictions. This approach offers a spatial resolution of 90 meters and uses TIFF format for data such as saturated water content, field capacity, wilting point, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. In contrast, traditional field survey techniques often involve direct soil sampling and measurements, which can provide high accuracy at specific points but may lack the broad spatial resolution and efficiency of digital mapping methods. The enhanced regression tree method used in digital mapping leverages major soil-forming factors as environmental variables, potentially offering more comprehensive spatial coverage and predictive capabilities compared to traditional methods.",

This approach can lead to more precise mapping of attributes such as saturation water content, field capacity, wilting point, and saturated hydraulic conductivity in the Heihe River Basin.",
