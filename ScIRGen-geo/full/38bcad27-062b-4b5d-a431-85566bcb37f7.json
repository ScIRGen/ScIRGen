            "description": "The dataset is the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) products of 2022 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is produced based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the SAVI equation which is added soil adjusted parameters S based on NDVI equation.The depended surface reflectance dataset has taken bidirectional reflectance distribution, the SAVI dataset not only eliminates atmospheric effects, but also reduces the differences caused by variations of solar elevation angle,so the SAVI dataset has better radiative consistency. And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow. SAVI is stable in the sparse vegetation area, but is not sensitive in the dense vegetation area .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the SAVI result of each image is stored in a folder including the SAVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI\", for example, L8-OLI-131-036-20220326-LSR-BRDF-SAVI;the SAVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\", for example, \"L8-OLI-131-036-20220326-LSR-BRDF-SAVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset: the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, Envi, QGIS and so on, the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be multiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "The need for incorporating soil adjustment factors arises because traditional vegetation indices like NDVI can be influenced by soil brightness, which affects the accuracy of vegetation assessments. In regions with sparse vegetation or varying soil reflectance, such as the Tibetan Plateau, the inclusion of a soil adjustment factor in the calculation of the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) helps mitigate these influences, resulting in more consistent and reliable data.",

This is achieved by incorporating a soil adjustment factor into the calculation, which reduces atmospheric effects and differences in reflectance due to varying solar angles, offering a more stable index in sparsely vegetated areas while being less sensitive in areas with dense vegetation cover.",
