The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The data of silicate melt inclusions were obtained by LA-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. The research results have certain guiding significance for limiting the initial failure time and possible mechanism of NCC.",
