      "description": "The alpine region of Asia is the third pole in the world, and it is called the \"Asian water tower\". Affected by climate warming, glaciers continue to lose money, which has profoundly changed the supply-demand relationship of glacial water resources. In order to systematically understand the response of glaciers to climate change, the project reveals the relationship between the change of glacier material balance and climate factors through the sensitivity of glacier material balance. The data includes two maps: the sensitivity distribution map of material balance to temperature and precipitation and the climate sensitivity zoning.\nIn the past 70 years, there have been significant differences in the evolution sequence of glacier material balance among mountain systems in the high mountain region of Asia. The glaciers in the Karakoram and West Kunlun regions have shown a stable state, and the material balance is a weak positive balance, while the Himalayas, Tianshan and Qilian Mountains have shown an accelerated trend after 1990. This is mainly due to the sensitivity of material balance to temperature and precipitation. The monthly scale material balance model is driven by 0.5 ° resolution era5 temperature and precipitation data, and the material balance calibration parameters of 43 monitored glaciers are 1 ° from 2000 to 2016 × The parameters are spatially constrained by the 1 ° aster material balance data, and the material balance sequences of 95085 glaciers in the high mountain region of Asia from 1951 to 2020 are reconstructed by using the method of extrapolation of spatial parameters. The sensitivity of glacier material balance to temperature (± 0.5K, ± 1K, ± 1.5k) and precipitation (± 10%, ± 20%, ± 30%) is analyzed, In combination with the influencing factors of glacier material balance (distribution of summer temperature, ratio of summer precipitation, distribution of glacier types, distribution of clear sky solar radiation in summer, etc.), the glacial climate sensitivity in the high mountain region of Asia is classified and divided into four categories, as shown in Fig. 4: the main control area of air temperature: the temperature is the main control factor of glacier material balance change, and precipitation occupies a secondary position; Precipitation control area: the glacier is mainly controlled by precipitation, and the temperature in the glacier area is lower than 0 ° C throughout the year; Temperature and precipitation control area of accumulated glacier in winter: refers to that the glacier is mainly supplied by precipitation in winter, and the change of material balance of the glacier is the result of the joint action of temperature and precipitation; Summer cumulative glacier temperature and precipitation control area: refers to the supply mode of glacier is summer precipitation, and the material balance of glacier is the result of the joint action of temperature and precipitation.",
      "descriptionCn": "亚洲高山区是世界第三极，称之为“亚洲水塔”，受气候变暖的影响，冰川持续亏损，深刻改变了冰川水资源的供需关系。为了系统认识冰川对气候变化的响应程度，项目通过冰川物质平衡的敏感性，揭示冰川物质平衡变化与气候因子之间的关系。数据包括两张图：物质平衡对气温的敏感性和物质平衡对降水的敏感性图，冰川气候敏感性分区图。\n在过去70年亚洲高山区各山系的冰川物质平衡演化序列差异显著，喀喇昆仑和西昆仑地区的冰川呈现出稳定态，物质平衡为微弱的正平衡，而喜马拉雅山、天山和祁连山在1990年之后出现加速退缩的趋势。这主要归因于物质平衡对气温、降水等敏感性。利用0.5°分辨率的ERA5 气温和降水数据驱动月尺度的物质平衡模型，通过43条监测冰川的物质平衡率定参数，2000-2016年的1°×1°ASTER物质平衡数据对参数进行空间约束，利用空间参数外推的方法重建了1951-2020年亚洲高山区95085条冰川的物质平衡序列，分析了冰川物质平衡对气温（±0.5k、±1k、±1.5k）和降水（±10%、±20%、±30%）的敏感性，根据物质平衡的空间敏感性差异，结合冰川物质平衡的影响要素（夏季气温的分布、夏季降水的比率、冰川类型的分布、夏季晴空太阳辐射分布等），对亚洲高山区的冰川气候敏感性进行归类划分，主要分为为4类： 气温主控区：指气温是冰川物质平衡变化的主要控制因素，降水占据次要位置； 降水控制区：指冰川主要受降水控制，全年的冰川区气温低于0℃； 冬季累积型冰川气温、降水控制区：指冰川主要受冬季的降水补给，冰川的物质平衡变化是气温和降水共同作用的结果； 夏季累积型冰川气温、降水控制区：指冰川的补给方式是夏季降水，冰川的物质平衡是气温和降水共同作用的结果。",

        "High Mountain Asia (HMA) is known as the Asian water tower, as it constitutes the largest concentration of glaciers and ice caps outside the polar regions, accounting for approximately 30% of the total area of all mountain glaciers on Earth. Due to ongoing climate change, most of the glaciers in HMA have suffered remarkable mass loss, becoming vulnerable and unsustainable due to their higher ablation than accumulation in these regions. The mass balance spatial heterogeneity loss has been obvious across HMA in recent decades, with extremely negative mass balance leading to marked glacier thinning in Tian Shan and Hengduan Shan. Nevertheless, the current climate factors do not fully explain the mass balance differences, such as the Karakoram Glacier Anomaly, as numerous gaps remain in our knowledge of regional glacier behavior and the interactions of glaciers with complex topography. Spatial heterogeneity of the mass balance within HMA is driven by different atmospheric circulation patterns, which transform the annual distribution and source of precipitation. It has been pointed out that the currently stable regional mass balance of Karakoram Anomaly glaciers might be attributable to topographic factors. The effect of complex topography on glacier mass balance reflects the influence of topographic shading. By obstructing solar illumination, topographic shading exerts a direct impact on solar radiation reaching the glacier surface and has a significant effect on glacier mass balance."

        "Therefore, in this study, we used the glacier outlines and raster data (SRTM DEM, slope and aspect) to calculate the topographic shading of all 97,965 glaciers within HMA during the ablation period, which is regarded as a major index of the influence of complex terrain on the mass balance."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "However, there is a lack of any systematic assessment of this influence across HMA. However, the problem still exists that climate factors are not able to explain the difference in mass balance under the same climate conditions at a smaller scale."

      "methods": [
        "Here, we used the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM data with a resolution of 90 m that covered all the glaciers within HMA, together with data on the glacier slope and aspect. We calculated the grid topographic shading by ray tracing according to the location between the grid and solar beam. Glacier surface topographic shading was calculated following the workflow shown in Figure 2 using the DEM and glacier outlines dataset. To obtain the glacier slope and aspect data, we transformed the DEM data from geographical coordinates to Asia North Lambert Conformal Conic projection coordinates, which is the projection data used to calculate the slope and aspect of glaciers within HMA. Finally, we obtained hourly glacier topographic shading data for all glaciers within HMA during the ablation period following the above steps."

Glacier surface topography was extracted from the SRTM DEM version 4 for the region 65–110° E and 25–55° N, fully covering all the glaciers in HMA. The glacier-wide geodetic mass balance data were calculated from the rate of elevation change extracted from a linear fit of multitemporal DEMs obtained from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which covers most glaciers within HMA, except Altay and Sayan."

The topographic shading contributed to the protection of the smallest glaciers from solar illumination. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the topographic shading and mass balance in these small north-facing glaciers. This indicates that complex terrain can affect the spatial distribution of the mass balance by altering the solar illumination pattern."

Employing a combination of satellite data sources, like ASTER and RGI 6.0, to expand spatial coverage and improve temporal resolution can also be beneficial. Additionally, implementing advanced modeling approaches that incorporate both topographic and climatic variables, along with improved calibration techniques using a larger number of monitored glaciers, can further refine mass balance estimates.",
        "AnswerCn": "增强数据集的覆盖范围和准确性可以通过整合高分辨率数字高程模型（DEM）数据来实现，例如具有90米分辨率的SRTM DEM，以更好地考虑地形特征。采用多种卫星数据源的组合，如ASTER和RGI 6.0，以扩展空间覆盖范围并提高时间分辨率也会有所帮助。此外，实施先进的建模方法，结合地形和气候变量，并使用更多监测冰川进行改进的校准技术，可以进一步精确质量平衡估算。",
