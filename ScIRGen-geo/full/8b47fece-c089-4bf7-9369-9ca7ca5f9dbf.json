            "description": "In the year of 2018, we collected the samples at Taxkorgan county, Kashgar district, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwestern China. Taxkorgan county is where the Pamir Plateau located in China. Nearly all this county is on the plateau. The average elevation of this county is more the 4000 m above the sea level. And the lowest part of the county is 3100 m above the sea level. In total, 204 samples were collected in Pamir Plateau this time. The samples collected from several different species which including cattle, yak, sheep, goat, donkey, horse and chicken. Each samples have 3-4 repetitions. For each animal, we recorded the id number, species, sex, date of sample collection, GPS coordination and elevation. Also three mateched images, i.e. from head, hoof or feet and whole body, were took for each animal. All the samples taken from the animal are the blood samples. They were keep into the refrigerator until they were finally tranfered and stored in the germplasm recourses bank.",

In the Pamir Plateau, factors such as varying altitudes (with average altitudes over 4000 meters and specific low-altitude sites like the county town at 3100 meters), logistical challenges, and the necessity to document and photograph each sampled animal could also play significant roles in determining collection sites.",
