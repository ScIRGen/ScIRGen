                    "Answer": "'Tree ring-based hydrological reconstruction' refers to a method of estimating historical hydrological data, such as river flow, by analyzing tree ring records. In this context, tree rings are used to reconstruct the May-August average flow rates of a river by establishing a linear transformation equation between the observed flow rates and the tree ring data, thus providing insights into past water resources over a long historical period, such as from 1753 to 2017.",

                    "Answer": "Inaccuracies in the tree-ring data used to reconstruct historical river flow rates could be caused by a variety of factors, such as variability in tree growth conditions over time, changes in local climate that may not be directly related to river flow, potential errors in the sampling and cross-dating process of tree rings, or limitations in the linear conversion equations used to translate tree-ring data into estimated flow rates.",

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves using tree-ring data to establish a linear conversion equation between tree-ring measurements and river flow data from observational periods. This conversion is then applied to reconstruct historical river flow data over a specified period, such as from 1753 to 2017, focusing on average flow rates from May to August.",
