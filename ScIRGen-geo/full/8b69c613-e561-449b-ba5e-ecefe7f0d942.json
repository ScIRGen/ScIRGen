            "description": "The 30 m / month vegetation index (NDVI / EVI) data set of Heihe River basin provides the monthly NDVI / EVI composite products from 2011 to 2014. This data uses the characteristics of HJ / CCD data of China's domestic satellite, which has both high time resolution (2 days after Networking) and spatial resolution (30 m), to construct multi angle observation data set. The average composite MC method is used as the main algorithm for synthesis, and the backup algorithm uses VI method. At the same time, the main observation angles of the multi-source data set are used as part of the quality descriptor to help analyze the angle effect of the composite vegetation index residue. The remote sensing data acquired every month can provide more angles and more observations than the single day sensor data, but the quality of multi-phase and multi angle observation data is uneven due to the difference of on orbit operation time and performance of the sensor. Therefore, in order to effectively use the multi-temporal and multi angle observation data, before using the multi-source data set to synthesize the vegetation index, the algorithm designs the data quality inspection of the multi-source data set, removing the observation with large error and inconsistent observation. The verification results in the middle reaches of Heihe River show that the NDVI / EVI composite results of the combined multi temporal and multi angle observation data are in good agreement with the ground measured data (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.092). In a word, the 30 m / month NDVI / EVI data set of Heihe River Basin comprehensively uses multi temporal and multi angle observation data to improve the estimation accuracy and time resolution of parameter products, so as to realize the stable standardized products from scratch and better serve the application of remote sensing data products.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
