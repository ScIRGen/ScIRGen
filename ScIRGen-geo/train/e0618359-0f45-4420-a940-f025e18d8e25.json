            "description": "Biodiversity is the sum of the ecological complex formed by organisms and their environment and various ecological processes related to it. It is expressed at all organizational levels of the life system, including genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity. The higher the habitat quality, the better the biological habitat environment and the higher the biodiversity. In some studies, the habitat quality index was used to characterize biodiversity (Xiao Qiang et al. 2014). Habitat quality index (HQ) is a dimensionless comprehensive index to evaluate the habitat suitability and habitat degradation degree of regional land use types. Cultivated land, roads, towns and rivers are used as habitat stress factors to form sensitivity parameters. For the production of biodiversity products, the biodiversity modeling of ecosystem in national barrier area is studied based on land use data and invest model. Invest model has the advantages of less input data, large output data and quantitative analysis of abstract ecosystem service functions. It is an important means of biodiversity assessment at present. Based on the actual situation of land use in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, five land use types with great impact of human activities, paddy field, dry land, urban land, rural residential area and other construction land, are selected as threat factors. Taking the land use data as the input variable of the invest model, the land biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau with a resolution of 1 km from 2000 to 2020 is estimated based on the parametric model.",

                    "Answer": "In the Tibetan Plateau, habitat quality indices are employed to assess land use types and the degree of habitat degradation, which are crucial for biodiversity modeling. These indices consider factors such as cropland, roads, towns, and rivers as stressors, and they are used as sensitivity parameters in models like InVEST. The model employs land use data to evaluate biodiversity at a 1 km resolution from 2000 to 2020, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity patterns in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The use of Habitat Quality Index in assessing biodiversity suggests that there is a significant relationship between different land use types and patterns of biodiversity. The index evaluates habitat suitability and degradation levels based on land use data, indicating that areas with high-quality habitats correspond to higher biodiversity. By including factors such as farmland, roads, urban areas, and rivers as stressors, this approach highlights how human activities impact biodiversity. The modeling of biodiversity using the InVEST model, which leverages land use data, allows for quantitative analysis of ecosystem services and biodiversity patterns over time, providing insights into how land use changes influence biodiversity trends on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2000 to 2020.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goal of using the InVEST model for estimating terrestrial biodiversity in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of habitat quality by assessing the suitability and degradation of habitats based on land use data. This approach aims to quantify biodiversity by incorporating various human impact factors like cropland, roads, urban areas, and rivers as stressors, enabling a detailed analysis of ecological processes and ecosystem services that contribute to biodiversity at multiple organizational levels, including genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity.",

These are used as input variables in the InVEST model. The model evaluates habitat suitability and degradation levels by integrating these land use data, which are then used to estimate biodiversity across the Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2020 at a 1km resolution. The InVEST model is chosen for its ability to conduct quantitative analysis of abstract ecosystem services with minimal input data and substantial output data.",
