            "description": "The data includes the runoff components of the main stream and four tributaries in the source area of the Yellow River. In 2014-2016, spring, summer and winter, based on the measurement of radon and tritium isotopic contents of river water samples from several permafrost regions in the source area of the Yellow River, and according to the mass conservation model and isotope balance model of river water flow, the runoff component analysis of river flow was carried out, and the proportion of groundwater supply and underground ice melt water in river runoff was preliminarily divided. The quality of the data calculated by the model is good, and the relative error is less than 20%. The data can provide help for the parameter calibration of future hydrological model and the simulation of hydrological runoff process.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing RNA-seq data from both highland Tibetan and lowland Han placental tissues allows researchers to examine gene expression differences that may arise due to adaptive responses to hypoxic environments. This approach can reveal specific genes that are differentially expressed in response to low oxygen levels, enhancing our understanding of genetic adaptations in diverse human populations. The data generated can help identify patterns of gene expression that are unique to populations living in high-altitude areas compared to those in low-altitude regions, contributing valuable insights into human adaptation and evolutionary biology.",

This approach enables the generation of RNA-seq data for studying gene expression differences by providing sufficient sequencing depth (6G per sample) and high-quality data with Q30>90%. This allows for the exploration of gene expression patterns in high-altitude Tibetan and lowland Han populations in response to hypoxic conditions.",

The anticipated challenges in collecting such data may include ensuring consistent sequencing depth across samples, maintaining high data quality (e.g., Q30>90%), and addressing potential biological variability between populations. These challenges could impact the quality and application of the data by affecting the accuracy and reliability of the gene expression patterns observed, which are crucial for studying adaptations to high-altitude hypoxic environments.",
