            "description": "This dataset includes the retrieved soil moisture products from the airborne PLMR microwave radiometer on 30 June, 7 July, 10 July, 26 July and 2 August, 2012 (UTC+8), in the HiWATER artificial oasis eco-hydrology experimental area of Heihe river basin. The soil moisture (SM), vegetation water content (VWC) and surface roughness (Hr) are simultaneously retrieved based on six brightness temperatures at three incidence angles (7°, 21.5°, 38.5°) and with dual polarization (H and V), by using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. The spatial resolution of the soil moisture products is 700 m, which represent the ~5 cm surface soil moisture according to the L-band observation wavelength. This dataset is in the format of asc, and with UTM projection (47°N). The validation against the eco-hydrological wireless sensor network observations and artificial synchronized observation shows that the total accuracy of this dataset can achieve 0.05 cm^3/cm^3, and that of the products on 7 July and 10 July even less than 0.04 cm^3/cm^3. This dataset can be helpful for the land surface process/hydrological process simulation and data assimilation, surface flux estimation, artificial irrigation management and spatial scaling research.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

                "Soil moisture is one of important variables in the climate and hydrology research． Microwave remote sensing now has been the main method to obtain soil moisture at regional scale, and L band is the optimal band for microwave soil moisture retrieval. Soil moisture, or soil humidity, is one of the core variables of the global climate system. The spatial and temporal distribution and dynamic changes of soil moisture have significant impacts on the heat balance between land and atmosphere and atmospheric circulation. In the context of climate change, the interaction between soil moisture and the climate system and its impact on climate change and human activities have received increasing attention. Conventional soil moisture ground observation methods such as drying methods, time domain/ frequency domain reflectometers, etc., consume a lot of manpower and material resources, making it difficult to conduct long-term, multi-frequency continuous observations, and even more unable to meet the needs of large-scale, near-real-time measurements. Among them, microwave remote sensing not only has the ability to observe all-weather and all-day, but also has unique advantages in retrieving soil moisture due to its high sensitivity to soil moisture and its ability to penetrate vegetation. Passive microwave remote sensing infers surface parameters and their states by measuring the microwave radiation brightness temperature of objects. The main spaceborne passive microwave radiometers include SMMR, SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR-2, and the SMOS satellite's L-band synthetic aperture radiometer. The main problem faced in model inversion is that there are too many parameters, and the number of unknown parameters in the model is more than independent observations, resulting in ill-posed inversion. The low-frequency L band can penetrate vegetation with moderate coverage (4-5 kg/m2), obtain microwave radiation information of the underlying soil, and is more suitable for retrieving soil moisture."
