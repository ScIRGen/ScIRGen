            "description": "This is the LAINet dataset measured in the corn field at the Xiaoman irrigation district (from 25 June, to 24 August, 2012). The time used in this dataset is in UTC+8 Time.\nInstrument: LAINet- A wireless sensor network for leaf area index measurement, Beijing Normal University\nMeasurement Mode: LAINet observation system is formed by 3 kinds of sensor nodes, they are respectively (1) node below the canopy, sensors up-looking are used for measure the transmitted radiation through the canopy, which are deployed horizontally; (2) node above canopy: sensors up-looking are used for measure the total sun incident radiation, which are deployed horizontally; (3) sink or router node, which is designed for receiving and transmitting data measured by the above node and below node.\nData Processing: the original data obtained from sensors is received by sink nodes, and forms the original dataset in days after pre-processed. The observation for transmittance of the canopy is acquired by calculating the ratio of the radiation through the canopy and the total incident radiation above the canopy at different sun elevation angles during a day. The retrieval of LAI is based on the multi-angle transmittance data.\nLAINet dataset is composed of original LAI data, LAI data after calculating the mean value in 5 days interval and the longitude and latitude of the measurement nodes. All the data are stored in the format of Excel. As for the data after calculating the mean value in 5 days, we take the number of aggregation nodes as the name of the sheet. Data saved in a sheet is from an sink node which receives the measurement data from the child nodes. The original data records the LAI of every node in the observation day. In the sheet of two kinds of data above, the meaning of the column is as follows: DOY, node one, node two, â€¦, and node N.",

                    "Answer": "The leaf area index data patterns are inferred from the ratio of radiation passing through the canopy to the total incident solar radiation, measured at different solar angles. These patterns can indicate changes in canopy density, growth stages, or health of the vegetation. Variations could also reflect environmental factors such as weather changes, soil moisture, or nutrient availability influencing plant growth. The multi-angle data collection helps to enhance the accuracy of LAI estimation, showcasing the dynamic interactions between the canopy and environmental conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The use of wireless sensor networks in leaf area index observations is driven by the need for precise measurement of radiation at different canopy levels. The LAINet observation system includes nodes placed under and above the canopy to measure transmitted and incident radiation, respectively. This setup allows for accurate calculation of canopy transmittance and leaf area index through the ratio of below-canopy transmitted radiation to above-canopy incident radiation across various solar angles.",

                    "Answer": "Using a multi-node LAINet system, which includes under-canopy, above-canopy, and convergence nodes, allows for more comprehensive data collection. This approach can improve the accuracy of leaf area index data by capturing variations across different angles and solar radiation conditions. The combination of multiple sensors helps in computing the canopy transmittance more effectively by averaging over different conditions, which might not be possible with a single-node system.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection involves using a wireless sensor network with three types of sensor nodes: beneath-canopy nodes for measuring transmitted radiation, above-canopy nodes for measuring incident solar radiation, and convergence nodes for receiving and forwarding data. The raw data from sensors are received by convergence nodes and preprocessed to form a daily dataset. The canopy transmittance is calculated as the ratio of transmitted radiation to incident radiation at different solar angles. Leaf area index is retrieved using multi-angle transmittance data.",
