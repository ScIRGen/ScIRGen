            "description": "This data set mainly includes zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, in-situ Hf isotopic data, whole rock major and trace geochemical data and Sr Nd isotopic data of granites along the southeast coast. The data were analyzed and tested by authoritative laboratories at home and abroad, and the data quality met the standard. Based on the data, the genesis of typical granites in the early Yanshanian continental margin arc (Jincheng granite in Fujian Province and fanyindong granite in Zhejiang Province) is defined. Combined with the existing research data of the early Yanshanian magmatic rocks along the southeast coast, the early Middle Jurassic continental margin arc magmatic belt in Southeast China is determined, and the specific time limit for the transition between the Pacific Ocean and the Tethys is determined, This provides a new understanding of the early history of the subduction of the paleo Pacific plate.",
