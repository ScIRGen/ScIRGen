This dataset typically includes information derived from digital elevation models (DEMs), such as those collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and is used to identify and analyze hydrological features like rivers and lakes, as well as to define the boundaries of sub-basins for research and management purposes.",

                    "Answer": "The need to use auxiliary data like reference rivers and lakes arises from the complexity of accurately delineating hydrological features in topographical datasets. The Tibetan Plateau's varied elevation and intricate water systems require precise data to correctly extract river networks and sub-basin boundaries, which can be challenging without supplementary information to guide the analysis.",

                    "Answer": "The goal of delineating and analyzing sub-basins such as the AmuDayra, Brahmaputra, and Ganges using SRTM DEM data and auxiliary hydrological data for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is to enhance the understanding of hydrological processes and water resource management within the region. This approach allows for detailed watershed modeling, which is essential for addressing challenges related to water availability, flood risk, and ecological conservation in the diverse and ecologically sensitive environments of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using interferometric synthetic aperture radar SRTM DEM data collected in 2000 along with reference data of rivers, lakes, and other water systems. The ArcGIS hydrological model is then utilized to analyze and extract the river networks. This allows for the division of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into 12 sub-basins, including AmuDayra, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Hexi, Indus, Inner, Mekong, Qaidam, Salween, Tarim, Yangtze, and Yellow. The external boundary of the study area is determined based on the 2500-meter contour line.",
