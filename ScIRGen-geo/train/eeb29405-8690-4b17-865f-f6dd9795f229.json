                    "Answer": "A sand desertification development degree map in the context of geographic information systems typically includes various thematic layers stored in formats like ESRI Shapefile, such as desertification maps, rivers, marshes, roads, lakes, and residential areas. It also involves data attributes related to desertification, such as the degree of desertification, sand landform types, grassland, woodland, woodland density, and farmland. The projection information is crucial, including details about angular units, prime meridian, datum, spheroid, and axes dimensions to ensure accurate spatial representation.",

                    "Answer": "The conversion process involves digitizing the printed maps, which may include scanning the maps at a high resolution, georeferencing them using the specified projection information (D_Beijing_1954, Krasovsky_1940), and then manually tracing or using software to delineate features such as sand dunes and vegetation types. These features are then categorized according to the provided attributes, such as sandification degree, shapes of sandy areas, grassland, woodland, woodland density, and farmland. Ensuring accuracy requires careful attention to the original legend and map scale (1:50000), as well as validation against any available ground truth data.",
