            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace data of granodiorite, zircon U-Pb dating data, zircon Lu Hf isotopic data, molybdenite Re Os isotopic data and in-situ Pb isotopic data of different sulfides in shangjinshan W-Mo polymetallic deposit in Jiangnan tungsten metallogenic belt. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. Re Os isotopic data of Molybdenite were obtained by ICP-MS, and in-situ Pb isotopic data of sulfide were obtained by fla MC ICPMS. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can study (1) rock and metallogenic age（ 2) The genesis and source of granodiorite related to mineralization（ 3) The relationship between granodiorite and tungsten mineralization（ 4) Magmatism and possible tectonic environment of W-Mo mineralization.",
