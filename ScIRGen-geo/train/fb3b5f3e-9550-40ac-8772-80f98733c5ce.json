            "description": "Pusangguo is a high-grade copper polymetallic deposit dominated by skarn. It is the only large copper lead zinc cobalt nickel deposit in the Gangdise metallogenic belt (GMB); There are few records of magmatic rocks related to the deposit, and its petrogenesis and geodynamic background are not clear. In order to explore these problems, we provided zircon u – Pb ages, Hf isotope, whole rock geochemistry and Sr – nd – Pb isotope data of Busan fruit biotite granodiorite (PBG) and Busan fruit diorite porphyrite (PDP) in the deposit.\nEntrusted the analysis and testing center of Beijing Institute of geology of nuclear industry and the State Key Laboratory of geological process and mineral resources of China University of Geosciences (Beijing);\nThe fresh rock samples were ground to 200 mesh without pollution for analyzing the main and trace elements and Sr nd Pb isotopic values of the whole rock. Zircon U-Pb Dating: Zircon was glued to the slide with double-sided adhesive, covered with PVC ring, and then epoxy resin and curing agent were fully mixed and injected into the PVC ring. After the resin is completely cured, the sample target is stripped from the glass slide, ground and polished, and then the sample on the target is photographed by reflected light and transmitted light under microscope and cathode fluorescence photography. According to the cathodoluminescence, reflected light and transmitted light photos of zircon, the appropriate (interested) zircon dating domain is selected. The data results are good.",

This approach can lead to a better understanding of the timing and conditions of mineralization, aiding in the exploration and development of similar deposits.",

For zircon U-Pb dating, zircons are adhered to a slide using double-sided tape, encapsulated with a PVC ring filled with a mixture of epoxy resin and hardener. After the resin cures, the sample target is polished and photographed under a microscope using reflected and transmitted light, along with cathodoluminescence imaging. Appropriate zircon domains are then selected for dating based on these images.",

These facilities utilize cutting-edge techniques for processing fresh rock samples, including contamination-free crushing to 200 mesh, and employ sophisticated instruments for measuring whole-rock major and trace elements and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic values.
