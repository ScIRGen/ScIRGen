      "description": "This data is the magnetism, grain size, chromaticity, diffuse reflectance spectral goethite / hematite peak height data, organic matter stable carbon isotope data of loess-paleosol sequence in Ganzi section (XS) in the east of Tibetan Plateau (TP). We measured the magnetic susceptibility and grain size of the section (10 m) at an interval of 2.5 cm, measured the non-hysteresis remanence and isothermal remanence data at an interval of 5 cm, and provided 5 sets of hysteresis loop measurement results. Total organic carbon (TOC) and organic carbon isotopes were measured at 10 cm and 20 cm intervals respectively. The experimental analysis of magnetic susceptibility was completed at the Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University, China. The soil δ13Corgmeasurements were conducted at the State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems (SKLGAE), Lanzhou University. And the analysis of remanence and hysteresis loop was completed at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Chromaticity analysis was carried out in the State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology. The magnetic susceptibility is measured by Bartington MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter, the non-hysteresis remanence is measured by American ASCIM-10-30 pulse magnetometer and molspin minispin small rotation magnetometer, and the isothermal remanence is measured by ASCIM-10-30 pulse magnetometer, 2g-755 superconducting magnetometer and JR-6A rotation magnetometer; he grain size data were measured by a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer; The chromaticity was determined by CM-700d spectrophotometer. The δ13Corgvalues were analyzed using a MAT-253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. This data provides an understanding of the magnetic properties and chromaticity variation characteristics of the loess sequence in the eastern TP since the last interglacial period, and plays an important role in the research of the paleoenvironment and paleoclimate in the eastern TP and its relationship with the surrounding atmospheric circulation.",

        "The stable carbon isotope (δ13Corg) composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is closely related to vegetation and soil pedogenic processes and is one of the main tools used to understand the component processes of the terrestrial carbon cycle. As the δ13Corg composition of a given plant is controlled by the environmental conditions as well as the vegetation type, the δ13Corg composition of loess–paleosol sequences has been widely used as a valuable indicator to reconstruct past environments and the paleoecology of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) and other regions. Numerous studies have shown that the δ13Corg values in paleosols are more positive than those in loess deposits. However, in eastern and southeastern Europe, central Asia, and the northwestern CLP, the loess δ13Corg values exhibit opposite patterns with more negative values during paleosol periods than those during loess accumulation periods since the last interglacial (LIG). The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has a strong influence on regional and global climate change due to its large area and high elevation. Aeolian loess is widely distributed on the TP and provides a crucial archive for understanding the evolution of the Indian monsoon and paleoenvironments of the TP. It has been inferred from a large dataset of the δ13C composition of modern soils on the TP that the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) are the main factors controlling the distribution of vegetation type on the TP, which causes the variation in δ13C composition of modern soils at any given altitude."

        "We conducted detailed δ13Corg and total organic carbon analyses of the Ganzi loess sequence on the eastern TP since the last interglacial (LIG). In the present research, we choose a typical loess section near Ganzi County on the eastern TP for detailed δ13Corg analysis. By combining our results with other environmental proxies, we discuss the variation characteristics of loess δ13Corg values during the last glacial–interglacial cycle and its environmental implications. The results of this study will deepen our understanding of the evolution of the paleoenvironment on the eastern TP."

        "The studied section was the XS section (99°59′E, 31°37′N), which is located in the northwestern region of Ganzi County at an elevation of 3400 m above sea level (a.s.l). Five samples for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating were taken by hammering stainless steel tubes into the fresh outcrop near the stratigraphic boundary. Bulk samples were collected at 2.5 cm intervals for the subsequent measurement of paleoenvironment proxies. For the samples taken at a depth of 1 m, 3 m, and 5 m, medium quartz grains (38–63 μm) were purified for OSL dating and were prepared following the methods of Lai et al. (2007). Quartz OSL dating with a standard single aliquot regenerative-dose protocol was performed using a Lexsyg research automatic TL/OSL reader at the Laboratory of the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. For the two bottom samples with depths at 7.5 m and 10 m, the quartz luminescence signal was close to saturation, which would have led to the underestimation of the ages of the samples. Thus, the post-infrared (IR)–IR stimulated luminescence (SL) (pIR–IRSL) dating on coarse grains of K-rich feldspar were conducted using an automated Risø TL/OSL reader at Lanzhou University. The soil δ13Corg measurements were conducted at the State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems (SKLGAE), Lanzhou University. Before measurement, all air-dried loess samples were ground into a uniform size powder (>200 mesh) after removal of modern rootlets. Subsamples of ~3 g were treated with 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl) for 24 h to remove inorganic carbon completely and then oven-dried at 40 °C after thorough rinsing with distilled water. Subsequently, 3–5 mg subsamples were weighed and placed in a tin cup for analysis. Total organic carbon (TOC) and magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements were carried out at the Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured at the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Xi'an."

        "The δ13Corg values of loess during glacial periods were lower than those during interglacial periods, with more negative values associated with the cold stages since the LIG on the eastern TP. The reconstruction of vegetation from the δ13Corg data indicated that C3/C4 mixed vegetation was dominated by C3 vegetation, and that the relative abundance of C4 vegetation during the glacial stages was much lower than that during MIS 5 and MIS 3. The high relative abundance of C4 plants during MIS 5 and MIS 3 suggested an increased proportion of C4 plants during the warm period. Since the LIG, the change in the abundance of C3/C4 vegetation in the Ganzi region has been mainly controlled by climate change at the glacial–interglacial scale. The combined effect of temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 caused changes in the paleovegetation on the eastern TP."
