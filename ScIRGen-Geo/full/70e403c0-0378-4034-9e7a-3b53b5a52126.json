      "description": "Snow cover is an important component of the cryosphere and an indispensable variable in the scientific research of global change and Earth system. The distribution range and phenological information of snow cover are important indicators to measure the variation characteristics of snow cover, and also important parameters for snow melting runoff simulation in the hydrological model of cold regions. The  High Mountain Asia is the source of many international rivers, and also the hot spot of global climate change research; The ecological and environmental problems caused by the change of ice and snow in the region, such as the reduction of water resources, the increase of extreme weather events, and the frequent occurrence of disasters, have attracted extensive attention from all countries. Therefore, it is very important for climate change research, water resources management, disaster early warning and prevention to accurately obtain long-term snow distribution and snow phenology data in  High Mountain Asia .\nThe daily cloudless MODIS normalized snow cover index (NDSI) product (2000-2021500 m) in the High Mountain Asia is based on the MODIS daily snow cover product (including Terra Morning Star data product MOD10A1 and Aqua Afternoon Star data product MYD10A1, C6 versions), and is processed by the same day afternoon star data fusion and cubic spline interpolation cloud removal algorithm; Among them, when there was only Morningstar data product MOD10A1 from 2000 to 2002, the cubic spline interpolation algorithm was directly used for cloud removal. The snow cover phenological data set for hydrological years 2002-2020 is prepared based on cloudless MODIS NDSI products in hydrological years, including three parameters:  snow onset date (SOD), snow end date (SED) and  snow duration days (SDD). This data set has reliable accuracy.",

        "Snow cover is a critical component of both the global energy and water cycles, covering about 40 to 50 % of the northern hemisphere during winter. Due to its high albedo and high emissivity as well as low thermal conductivity, snow cover has a large-scale cooling effect on the global climate system through strong interaction with the surface energy budget. Seasonal snow cover in high latitude and altitude regions in the northern and southern hemispheres is very sensitive to climate change. In this climate change context, the snow-covered extent (SCE) in the Northern Hemisphere has undergone significant reductions over the past decades and this trend will continue. HMA is the third largest cryosphere on earth outside of the Earth’s polar regions, known as the third pole of the earth, the birthplace of many great rivers, known as \"Water Tower of Asia\". As one of the most sensitive and prominent regions responding to global climate changes, HMA has experienced a considerable warming trend and the components of cryosphere (such as snow cover and glaciers) have been rapid shrinking over the last decades. Impacts of climate change on the cryosphere strongly led to changes in mountainous hydrological processes and water resources, and increased the HMA’s runoff due to the accelerated glacier/snowmelt."

Using the daily cloud-free MODIS snow cover products, the main objectives of this study are to (1) extract the snow cover parameters (SCE, SCD, SOD, SED and SDD) and analyse their spatiotemporal variations; (2) reveal the vertical difference of the relation of elevation to snow phenology; (3) to investigate the potential influence of climate factors on snow phenology variations."

The SCD is calculated as the number of days a pixel is covered by snow in a hydrological year.

There is an elevation dependence of snow phenology changes over HMA with the high-altitude mountain ranges generally having a higher SCD, earlier SOD, later SED and longer SDD than low altitude areas. The air temperature of snow accumulation period is the dominant factor affecting the interannual variation of SOD, and the air temperature of snow melt period is the dominant factor affecting the interannual variation of SED.

        "QuestionCn": "分析在高海拔亚洲地区使用遥感数据监测雪相的挑战。",
        "AnswerEn": "The challenges include extensive cloud cover over snow-covered regions, which limits the application of MODIS snow cover products for monitoring. There is also inconsistency in the study region, time frame, and scale, making it difficult to understand changes in snow cover.",
        "AnswerCn": "挑战包括在雪覆盖区域的广泛云层，这限制了MODIS雪盖产品的应用。研究区域、时间框架和尺度的不一致性也使得理解雪盖变化变得困难。",
