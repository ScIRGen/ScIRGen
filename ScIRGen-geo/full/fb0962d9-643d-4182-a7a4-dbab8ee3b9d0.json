            "description": "The data are zircon in-situ trace element, Hf isotope and U-Pb dating data, and apatite in-situ major (including F, Cl) and trace element geochemical data of ore bearing rocks and surrounding rocks of Luobuling porphyry Cu-Mo deposit in Zijinshan mineralization field, Fujian Province. The lithology of the samples includes biotite granodiorite porphyry (LBL20-01), granodiorite porphyry (LBL20-02, LBL22-02), porphyritic granodiorite (Zhongliao pluton, LBL22-03) and granodiorite (Sifang pluton, SF09-05). Zircon in-situ Lu-Hf isotopic data, U-Pb isotopic dating data and trace element data were obtained by LA-ICP-MS analysis. Apatite major (including F, Cl) and trace element data were obtained by EMPA and LA-ICP-MS analysis, respectively. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can further study the genesis, tectonic setting and evolution process of the Zijinshan porphyry-epithermal ore system.",
            "instructions": "All data are stored in Excel file and can be opened directly in Excel workbook. The file named \"Zrn_UPb\" file represents the U-Pb isotopic composition of zircon, \"Zrn_Tra\" stands for zircon trace element data, \"Zrn_Hf\" represents the Hf isotopic data of zircon,\" Ap_FClMaj\" represents the data of major elements (including F and Cl) of apatite, \"Ap_Tra\" represents apatite trace element data.",

LA-ICP-MS is effective for obtaining zircon U-Pb isotopic dating and Lu-Hf isotopic data, as well as trace element concentrations, which are crucial for understanding the geological history and mineralization processes. EMPA is used to analyze the major elements in apatite, including F and Cl, offering insights into the mineral's formation conditions and the fluid characteristics involved in the mineralization process.",
