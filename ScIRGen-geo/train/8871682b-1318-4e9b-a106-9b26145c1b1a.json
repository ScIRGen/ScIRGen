            "description": "The 30 m / month synthetic leaf area index (LAI) data set of Heihe River basin provides the monthly Lai synthetic products from 2011 to 2014. This data uses the domestic satellite HJ / CCD data with high time resolution (2 days after Networking) and spatial resolution (30 m) to construct the multi angle observation data set. Considering the impact of surface classification and terrain fluctuation, the algorithm is selected according to the characteristics of different vegetation types Choosing a suitable parameterization scheme of integrated model, inversion Lai based on look-up table method. The remote sensing data acquired every month can provide more angles and more observations than the single day sensor data, but the quality of multi-phase and multi angle observation data is uneven due to the difference of on orbit operation time and performance of the sensor. Therefore, in order to effectively use multi temporal and multi angle observation data, a data quality inspection scheme is designed. Using the Lai ground observation data of 9 forest quadrats, 20 farmland quadrats and 14 savanna quadrats from dayokou area in the upper reaches of Heihe River and Yingke and Linze areas in the middle reaches to verify the Lai in July, the inversion results are in good agreement with the measurement results, and the average error is less than 1; in addition, the Lai inversion results of the combined multi temporal and multi angle observation data are in good agreement with the ground measurement data （R2=0.9，RMSE=0.42）。 In a word, the 30 m / month synthetic leaf area index (LAI) data set of Heihe River Basin comprehensively uses multi temporal and multi angle observation data to improve the estimation accuracy and time resolution of parameter products, so as to better serve the application of remote sensing data products.",

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

Accurate LAI retrieval is always a key task of such remote-sensing applications, and it is also a precondition of crop-yield estimation, vegetative evapotranspiration calculation and the energy-exchange evaluation of terrestrial vegetation (Badhwar et al., 1986; Townshend et al., 1988; Baret et al., 1991; Wood et al., 1993; Bonan, 1995; Bicheron et al., 1999; Buermann et al., 2001; Kamalesh et al., 2008). In general, there are three categories of LAI retrieval methods. The first category is experiential inversion method based on Vegetation Index (VI), such as retrieving LAI according to the correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LAI (Turner, 1999; Brown et al., 2000; Haboudane et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005). Although such an approach is simple and widely-used, its accuracy is very low, and some VI can easily get saturated. The second category can be called the reflectance model inversion method, by which the anisotropic effect caused by sun-object-sensor geometry can be removed, but the effect caused by background variations cannot be avoided, especially within mixed pixels. The complex background inhibits accurate LAI retrieval (Li et al., 1986; Nilson et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1997; Xu, 2005)."
