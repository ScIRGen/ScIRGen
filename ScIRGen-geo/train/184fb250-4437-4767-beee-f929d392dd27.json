            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Qinghai Lake integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Yulei station on Qinghai lake from Janurary 1 to December 31, 2020. The site (100° 29' 59.726'' E, 36° 35' 27.337'' N) was located on the Yulei Platform in Erlangjian scenic area, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3209m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP155; 12 and 12.5 m above the water surface, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (windsonic; 14 m above the water surface, towards north) , rain gauge (TE525M; 10m above the water surface in the eastern part of the Yulei platform ), four-component radiometer (NR01; 10 m above the water surface, towards south), one infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 10 m above the water surface, towards south, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (LI190SB; 10 m above the water surface, towards south), water temperature profile (109, -0.2, -0.5, -1.0, -2.0, and -3.0 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_12 m, Ta_12.5 m; RH_12 m, RH_12.5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_14 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_14 m) (°) , precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (μmol/ (s m-2)), water temperature (Tw_20cm、Tw_50cm、Tw_100cm、Tw_200cm、Tw_300cm) (℃).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. As the lake water freezes in winter, the water temperature probe is withdrawn, so there is no water temperature data record during October 19, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018-1-1 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.",

This system typically includes sensors placed at different levels to record data such as wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, and other relevant meteorological factors over a specific area, such as a lake surface, to understand how these elements change with height or depth.",

Additionally, challenges include handling missing data, denoted by -6999, and ensuring daily data integrity with 144 data points collected every 10 minutes.

                    "Answer": "To set up a comprehensive meteorological observation system for monitoring surface processes in a lake basin, it is essential to install various sensors and instruments at specific heights and orientations. For instance, wind speed and direction sensors should be positioned 14 meters above the lake surface facing north. Air temperature and relative humidity sensors need to be placed at 12 and 12.5 meters above the lake surface, also facing north. A tipping-bucket rain gauge should be installed 10 meters above the lake surface. A four-component radiometer should face south, mounted at 10 meters. Additionally, an infrared thermometer should be installed 10 meters above the surface, facing south with a downward probe orientation to measure surface radiation temperature. Water temperature probes should be submerged at different depths (0.2m, 0.5m, 1.0m, 2.0m, and 3.0m) to monitor lake water temperature. A photosynthetically active radiation sensor should be mounted 10 meters above the lake surface, facing south with a downward orientation. Data should be recorded every 10 minutes, with a focus on quality control measures, such as marking missing data with placeholders, removing duplicate entries, and flagging questionable data for review.",

                    "Answer": "The use of an integrated observation system comprising various sensors for wind speed and direction, air temperature and humidity, precipitation, radiation components, infrared temperature, and lake water temperature at different depths enables comprehensive observation. These sensors are strategically placed at specific heights and orientations to capture precise environmental data, and are complemented by data processing and quality control measures such as marking missing data, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent date-time formatting.",
