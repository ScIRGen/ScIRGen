            "description": "The 1:1 million wetland data of Guangdong Province (2000) is cut from the \"1:1 million wetland data of China\".\n\"China 1:100,000 wetland data\" mainly reflects the information of marshes and wetlands throughout the country in the 2000s, and is represented by geographical coordinates in decimal scale. The main contents include: types of marshes and wetlands, types of water supply, types of soil, types of main vegetation, and geographical regions.The information classification and coding standard of China sustainable development information sharing system was implemented.Data source of this database: 1:20 swamp map (internal version), 1:500 000 swamp map (internal version) of qinghai-tibet plateau, 1:100 000 swamp survey data and 1:400 000 swamp map of China;The processing steps are as follows: data source selection, preprocessing, marshland element digitization and coding, data editing and processing, establishment of topological relationship, edge-to-edge processing, projection transformation, connection with attribute database such as geographical name and acquisition of attribute data.",

This method provides precision and is used in the wetland data collection to accurately reflect the spatial distribution and attributes of marsh wetlands across the specified geographic area.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using 1:20 scale maps are likely to provide more detailed and accurate information compared to 1:400 scale maps due to the higher resolution and finer granularity, allowing for more precise representation of wetland features such as types, water sources, soil types, and vegetation. The 1:20 scale maps can capture finer details and variations within smaller areas, which may be generalized in the larger scale of 1:400 maps.",

The process involves several steps like data source selection, preprocessing, and establishing topological relationships, each of which can introduce challenges and potential inaccuracies.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps for generating a comprehensive wetland dataset at a scale of 1:100万 involve selecting data sources such as 1:20 swamp maps, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau 1:50万 swamp maps, 1:100万 swamp survey data, and national 1:400万 swamp maps. These sources undergo pre-processing, followed by the digitization and encoding of swamp wetland elements. Data editing and processing are performed to establish topological relationships and manage edge-matching. There is also a projection transformation step, and the dataset integrates with attribute databases to obtain relevant attribute data, all while adhering to the 'China Sustainable Development Information Sharing System Information Classification and Coding Standards.'",
