            "description": "This data set mainly includes daily surface evapotranspiration products in Heihe River Basin (HRB) from 2010 to 2016, with a resolution of 100 meters. Based on multi-source remote sensing data (MODIS Landsat TM/ETM+ data) and regional meteorological data (China meteorological forcing dataset, CMFD), sensitivity parameters of the theoretically robust surface energy balance system (SEBS) model were determined through global sensitivity analysis, and then the parameterization scheme of the model was optimized to improve the estimation accuracy. At the same time, combined with spatial and temporal data fusion algorithm of remote sensing image. Finally, the High-Temporal and Landsat-Like surface evapotranspiration (ET) (HiTLL ET) was obtained over the Heihe Basin. It was validation by the EC measurements from the flux observation stations and ETMap, and the estimation results are consistent with the observation and the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of ETMap. This data set can provide data support for the study of water consumption law and scientific effective management of watershed water resources within HRB, especially for woodland and grassland in the upper stream regions, oasis farmland and desert vegetation in the midstream and downstream regions.",

                "The estimation of land-surface evapotranspiration (ET) at high spatial and temporal resolutions is important for management and planning of agricultural water resources, but available remote sensing data generally have either high spatial resolution or high temporal resolution. Irrigation accounts for approximately 70% of the world's total freshwater withdrawals. Agricultural production in arid and semi-arid areas usually requires irrigation, and these regions consume approximately 80% to 95% of the total freshwater used for irrigated agriculture in Western Europe, Western Asia, and Northwest China. Quantification of irrigation water efficiency at the field scale first requires accurate and high spatiotemporal resolution estimates of surface evapotranspiration (ET), and these measurements can provide a basis for making decisions regarding irrigation management. Satellite sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) provide daily thermal infrared (TIR) data, but their resolutions (~1 km) are too coarse for estimation of ET at the field scale. On the other hand, the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM)/7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and the Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) provide high spatial resolution thermal infrared (TIR) data (approximately 100 m), but they have a lengthy return interval, and cloud cover can interfere with image acquisition. Therefore, a method that combines the fine spatial resolution of Landsat-like data and the high temporal resolution of MODIS-like data will provide significant benefits for water resource management at the field scale."

The validation results indicated good accuracy for land cover types of maize and vegetables, a slight overestimation for residential and wetland sites, and a slight underestimation for orchard site. Our comparison of the input parameter fusion approach (IPFA) and the ET fusion approach (ETFA) with field measurements indicated the IPFA was superior than the ETFA for land surfaces with high spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, our high spatiotemporal ET estimates indicated that irrigation water efficiencies of the irrigation districts (mean: 70%) and villages (mean: 62%) had large spatial heterogeneity. These results point to the need for calculating ET at a high spatiotemporal resolution for monitoring and improving irrigation water efficiency at local scales. Our findings suggest that the proposed framework of estimating daily ET at a Landsat-like scale using multi-source data may also be applicable to other heterogeneous landscapes by providing a foundation for management of water resources at the basin or finer scales."
