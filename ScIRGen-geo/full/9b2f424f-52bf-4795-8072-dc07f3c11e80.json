            "description": "Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) is a key physiological variable in the study of carbon cycling and is one of the basic variables to describe vegetation ecosystems. The classification results of surface vegetation types in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region are obtained based on the Landsat reflectance data(30m spatial resolution). According to NDVI of different vegetation types, the remote sensing inversion model is constructed to produce the growing season FPAR products for each vegetation type. This product can be used as one of the parameters to calculate vegetation carbon sequestration and evaluate vegetation ecosystem status.",
            "instructions": "File naming: The FPAR dataset is stored in Geotiff format in blocks,and the file name is \"N??E??.tif\", where N?? represents the latitude of the upper left corner of the corresponding image block, and E?? represents Corresponds to the longitude of the upper left corner of the image block. Data reading method: you can directly use any software that supports tif image to open; it is recommended to use QGIS, ArcGIS, ENVI and other geographic information related software to open.",

                "Global land-cover information, as used by the scientific community, governments, and international organizations, is critical to the understanding of environmental changes, food security, conservation, and the coordination of actions needed to mitigate and adapt to global change. These data also play an important role in improving the performance of models of the ecosystem, hydrology, and atmosphere. Due to the frequent and large area coverage that it provides, more and more attention has been attached to using remote sensing technology for global land-cover mapping. In past decades, several global land-cover products have been produced at various spatial resolutions ranging from 1 km to 300 m. However, owing to differences in classification accuracy, thematic detail, classification schemes, and spatial resolution, the harmonization of these land-cover products is usually difficult, and their quality is also far from satisfactory for many fine applications. Recently, thanks to free access to fine-resolution remote sensing imagery (Landsat and Sentinel-2), combined with rapidly increasing data storage and computation capabilities, global land-cover products at fine spatial resolutions (10 and 30 m) have been successfully developed. Although these products permit the detection of land information at the scale of most human activity and offer increased flexibility for the environmental model parameterization needed for global land-cover studies, the simple classification system and large amount of manual work required (manual collection of training samples and knowledge-based interactive verification) limit their greater use in many specific and fine applications at regional or global scales."

                "As Giri et al. (2013) and Ban et al. (2015) stated, there are a number of challenges to overcome in producing a fine-resolution characterization of global land cover. These include the unavailability of timely, accurate, and sufficient training data; the high cost of collecting satellite data with consistent global coverage; difficulties in preparing image mosaics; and the need for high-performance computing facilities. Firstly, Foody and Arora (2010) stated that the training data had more impact on the classification results than the selection of the classifier: the collection of timely, accurate, and sufficient training data is especially important for global or regional land-cover mapping."

            "methods": [
                "First, the global training data from the GSPECLib were developed by applying a series of rigorous filters to the CCI_LC (Climate Change Initiative Global Land Cover) land-cover and MCD43A4 NBAR products (MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance). Secondly, a local adaptive random forest model was built for each 5°×5° geographical tile by using the multi-temporal Landsat spectral and texture features and the corresponding training data, and the GLC_FCS30-2015 land-cover product containing 30 land-cover types was generated for each tile. Lastly, the GLC_FCS30-2015 was validated using three different validation systems (containing different land-cover details) using 44,043 validation samples."

In this study, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM, which has a spatial resolution of 30 m and covers the area between 60◦N and 56◦S, and the slope and aspect variables, were used as the classification features. In this study, the global land-cover classification neglected the impervious surface land-cover type when building the classification model; instead, existing global 30 m impervious surface products for 2015 (MSMT_IS30-2015) were directly superimposed over the global land-cover classifications (Zhang et al., 2020). Overall, after the combination of the auxiliary datasets from multiple sources and careful rechecking by several interpreters, a total of 44 043 validation samples for 24 fine land-cover types were finally collected."

The comparisons against other land-cover products (CCI_LC, MCD12Q1, FROM_GLC, and GlobeLand30) indicated that GLC_FCS30-2015 provides more spatial details than CCI_LC-2015 and MCD12Q1-2015 and a greater diversity of land-cover types than FROM_GLC-2015 and GlobeLand30-2010. They also showed that GLC_FCS30-2015 achieved the best overall accuracy of 82.5% against FROM_GLC-2015 of 59.1% and GlobeLand30-2010 of 75.9%. Therefore, it is concluded that the GLC_FCS30-2015 product is the first global land-cover dataset that provides a fine classification system (containing 16 global LCCS land-cover types as well as 14 detailed and regional land-cover types) with high classification accuracy at 30 m."
