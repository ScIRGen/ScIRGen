            "description": "The Qilian Mountains are located on the northeast edge of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Due to the impact of climate warming and human activities, the permafrost beneath them is facing rapid degradation. At the same time, a series of disasters such as retrogressive thaw slumps, active-layer detachment slides, and thermal erosion gullies are also increasing year by year, causing huge damage to the local ecology, economy, engineering, and human safety. However, there is currently a lack of disaster investigation on freeze-thaw induced slope instability in the Qilian Mountains region. In order to obtain the first list of hillslope thermokarst in the Qilian Mountains, we conducted multiple visual interpretations of multi-source remote sensing data within the Qilian Mountains, and verified and modified the interpretation results through multiple field investigations. Finally, 1064 hillslope thermokarst disasters with an area of nearly 20 square kilometers were identified and plotted. The results of this study will be fundamental for quantitative assessments that explore the exact causes and underlying thermokarst processes, and ultimately allow for better identification prediction of areas prone to thermokarst formation in the future.

                "Climate warming and anthropogenic disturbances result in permafrost degradation in cold regions, including in the Qilian Mountains. The Qilian Mountains are located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, at the confluence of three major geographical regions, i.e., the eastern monsoon zone, the northwestern arid zone, and the alpine zone of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Due to its unique geographical and environmental characteristics, permafrost is widespread and underlies about 50 % of the area. Permafrost has an important role in storing frozen water, thereby contributing to water conservation. Due to climate warming and human activities, significant permafrost degradation results in the frequent occurrence of thermokarst, representing a serious threat to ecological security and adversely impacting the environment and human beings. Despite the importance of thermokarst processes and their potential geohazards, the distribution of thermokarst landscapes is currently mostly undocumented. The permafrost zone of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has been a site of thermokarst geomorphology research in recent years. The Qilian Mountains play an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of the Tibetan Plateau, stopping the southward progression of deserts, and maintaining the stability of the oases in the Hexi Corridor."

More specifically, 392 sites (37 %) were initiated during 2010–2015 and 482 (45 %) after 2015. Thermokarst terrain is observed primarily in areas with shallow active-layer depths (average thickness 2.98 m) on northern shaded slopes of 3–25°, with low solar radiation and moderate elevations ranging from 3200 to 4000 m. The datasets are available from the National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center and can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.11888/Cryos.tpdc.300805 (Peng and Yang, 2023)."

                "We successfully produced the first HT inventory for this area, identifying a total of 1064 HT features. Thermokarst is primarily concentrated at the junction between the upstream portion of the Heihe basin and the middle and upstream portions of the Datonghe basin. HT in the Qilian Mountains is more likely to occur on north-facing shaded slopes at elevations between 3200 and 4000 m, on slopes of 3–25°, with 0.5 <TPI <0.8, and in alpine meadow vegetation. Based on long-term satellite imagery, 874 new HT features were initiated after 2010, accounting for 82 % of all HT features. Recent higher air temperatures during the thawing season are likely important reasons for the intensification of HT formation in the Qilian Mountains. This first HT inventory for the Qilian Mountains will be fundamental for quantitative assessments that explore the exact causes and underlying thermokarst processes, providing observational data support for automated extraction of HT features and ultimately enhancing the identification and prediction of regions prone to thermokarst processes in the future."
