            "description": "The dataset of intensive rain gauges observations was obtained in the arid region hydrology experiment area, in cooperation with dual polarized doppler radar observations. There was no single dataset for the upper stream observations for the poor quality; the middle stream dataset was collected by 29 RG3-M self-recording rain gauges: the northernmost (100.36°E, 39.16°N), the southernmost (100.34°E, 38.61°N), the easternmost (100.62°E, 38.87°N), and the westernmost (100.26°E, 38.82°N). Rain gauges R02-R09 measured from May 18 to Oct. 9, 2008, and R10-R30 from May 26 to Oct. 9, 2008. The technique criterions of these rain gauges were :\n     (1) caliber: 165mm×254mm\n     (2)  the temperature range:  0°C —+70°C\n     (3)  resolution: 0.2mm\n     (4)  the measuring range: 0—320cm\n     (5)  the measuring accuracy: 1%",
