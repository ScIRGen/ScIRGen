            "description": "In order to better explain the landscape characteristics of the mountain natural belt, as well as the internal relationship between the material exchange and geochemistry of the constituent elements, clarify the migration and transformation of the elements and their compounds in the natural landscape. We analyzed the contents of elements in rocks, weathering crust (soil parent material) and upper soil of each natural zone landscape, calculated the migration coefficients of large and trace elements, and worked out the migration series of elements in weathering crust and soil of the landscape. The inactive elements (or weakly migrated elements) in the supergene zone of landscape include aluminum and titanium. When calculating the migration ability of large and trace elements, the leaching amount, leaching rate (%) and migration coefficient of each element are calculated with aluminum and titanium as the benchmark respectively.",
