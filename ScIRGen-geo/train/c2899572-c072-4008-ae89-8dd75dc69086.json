            "description": "The data include three files on the spatial variation of surface elevation of endorheic glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau from 1975-2000 (100m), the mean elevation change values of glaciers in each sub-basin of the endorheic region from 1975-2020, and the basin boundaries and zoning. The glacier surface elevation changes from 1975-2000 were obtained based on 32 pairs of KH-9 data and NASADEM, where the results for the Muzetag and Puruogangri areas were obtained from Zhou et al. (2018) and Bhattacharya et al. (2021) respectively The average elevation change results for each 5-year period from 1995-2020 for the respective basins were obtained based on data published by Huggonet et al. (2021), and here it is assumed that the glacier thickness changes from 1995-2000 are similar to those from 2000-2005. Due to the limitation of KH-9 data quality and the glacier characteristics in the instream area, there are many null areas, and it is recommended to combine the zoning and calculate the change results for each elevation zone first, and then project them to each sub-basin.",

These satellites captured high-resolution data used to analyze spatial changes in glacier surface elevation over time. In this case, KH-9 data is specifically utilized to observe changes between 1975 and 2000 in the glaciers of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's endorheic areas.",

This involves leveraging KH-9 data and NASADEM for the period 1975-2000 and using Hugonnet et al. (2021) data for 1995-2020, assuming similar glacier thickness changes between 1995-2000 and 2000-2005.
