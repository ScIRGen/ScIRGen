                "Forest biomass accounts for about 42% of the terrestrial carbon storage. In particular, woody biomass of a forest constitutes a main component of its lasting carbon stocks, together with soils, contributing substantially to the sequestration of greenhouse gases thus to the mitigation of climate warming. Standing biomass reflects the net outcome of carbon allocation and disturbance dynamics processes over longer time scales. As shown by land surface modeling, global warming, drought stress, and deforestation in the past decades have greatly affected the structure and function of forests through change in biomass accumulation, thus altering this crucial natural resource for human well-being. Therefore, a better understanding of how biomass changes in response to the environment, especially along elevation and climatic gradients in mountainous areas, is vital to inform sustainable forest management and strengthen natural climate solutions. Forest biomass depends on environmental or climatic variables at the regional scale. At the same time, species composition and vegetation structure govern biomass accumulation in different forest types. Tropical forests are known to accumulate higher biomass than temperate and boreal forests. Similarly, biomass is known to decline with elevation in the tropical montane forests. Both biotic and abiotic factors affect forest biomass. For example, climatic factors such as available soil moisture and temperature variability can influence the accumulation of forest biomass by modifying stand density and forest composition, driving growth rates and phenology, and altering the availability of soil nutrients. In addition, diversity is a crucial factor influencing forest biomass. For instance, higher functional and species diversity may enhance productivity by reducing niche overlap and improving resource availability and use. These findings, however, remain controversial for natural forest ecosystems, particularly along elevational and climatic gradients, with positive, negative, or neutral relationships reported between species richness and biomass. Structural attributes (e.g., stem density, tree height, and diameter) are keys for biotic interactions among neighboring trees in a forest stand, as well as for resource limitation. These attributes are tightly coupled with biomass. The site conditions (e.g., soil type and disturbance) can also influence the structural and diversity attributes of forest stands. Mountains offer heterogeneous environmental and climatic conditions, thus providing habitats for many plant species along wide bioclimatic gradients. Most existing studies, however, are limited in geographical scope, especially in subtropical/tropical forests. A global map of the potential rate of aboveground C accumulation at a resolution of 1 km2 exists, but cannot well represent elevation-dependent biomass and biodiversity gradients. Indeed, to date, very few field studies have focused on the variability of forest biomass across several bioclimatic zones. In addition, most existing studies have considered only one or two factors influencing biomass. In order to gain a better understanding of the complexity of C allocation, it is thus essential to engage in ecological in situ studies across large environmental gradients, particularly in understudied diversity hotspots such as the Himalayan region."
