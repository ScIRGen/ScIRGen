                "Reservoirs play a key role in water resources management, including water supply, hydropower generation, and flood control. About 16.7 million reservoirs with a surface area larger than 100 m² have been built worldwide. With the increase in the number of reservoirs, total water surface area of global reservoirs increased from 4.11 × 10⁵ km² in 1984 to 4.48 × 10⁵ km² in 2015, leading to increased reservoir evaporation losses. From a global perspective, Shiklomanov (1999) estimated that global reservoir evaporation volume is about 188 km³ in 1995, which is larger than global domestic and industrial water consumption of the year (~132 km³). From a regional perspective, Zhao and Gao (2019) showed that annual total reservoir evaporation from large reservoirs (storage capacity greater than 0.1 km³) in the United States is equivalent to 93% of annual public water supply of the country in 2010. Reservoir evaporation volume is calculated by multiplying reservoir surface area and evaporation rate. Reservoir surface area can be estimated from field measurement and remote sensing images. Compared with the field measurement, the method using remote sensing images has advantages of low cost, global coverage, and easy access. The Penman equation and its variants can calculate the effect of heat storage of large reservoir on evaporation. The effect can be calculated using the equilibrium temperature, which is the water temperature without heat exchange between air and water under constant forcing."

In this study, we estimated monthly reservoir evaporation for large reservoirs of China from 1985 to 2018 using the GRSAD and the Penman equation incorporated with the heat storage."

In 2018, total reservoir evaporation losses were 140.2 × 10⁸ m³, which is about 1.1 times the amount of water transferred in the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project in China. Total evaporation losses of large reservoirs in China are significantly smaller than that in the United States, although total storage capacities of large reservoirs in the two countries are similar. This is mainly due to the larger average depth and smaller area of China's large reservoirs."
