            "description": "Lake salinity is an important parameter of lake water environment, an important embodiment of water resources, and an important part of climate change research. This data is based on the measured salinity data of lakes in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The salinity is characterized by the practical salinity unit (PSU), which is converted from the specific conductivity (SPC) measured by the conductivity sensor. ArcGIS software was used to convert the measured data into space vector format. SHP format, and the measured salinity spatial distribution data file was obtained. The data can be used as the basic data of lake environment, hydrology, water ecology, water resources and other related research reference.",
