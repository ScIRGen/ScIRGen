            "description": "Pollen and spores extracted from sediment are considered as the important proxy in reconstructing past vegetation and climate, and which plays essential role in investigating environmental evolution during the Quaternary. Accurate identification of pollen and spore is the base for palynological research, which determines it is quite necessary to establish modern atlas for pollen and spore. Supported by the projects the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences “Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE)” and The Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research, authors completed the vegetation and soil surveys in 2018 for the alpine meadow in the east Tibetan Plateau (including Yushu Prefecture, Changdu City, Ganzi prefecture, Naqu City) and alpine forest in the southeast Tibetan Plateau (Linzhi City) , and collected 401 specimens for anther of flowering plants and sporangium of ferns. Pollen and spores were extracted and from these specimens using the standard acid-alkali approach and acetolysis (9:1 mixture of acetic anhydride and sulphuric acid) treatment, and further were refrigerated in glycerin. More than two photographs were took for each pollen and spore type, using the LEICA-dm-2500 optical microscope and its imaging system with scale. The atlas of pollen and spore morphology will be a valuable reference for palynology research and teaching.",

The sporopollen specimens of the same family are stored in the same folder, and all the files are named by Latin name and Chinese name.",

                "Due to insufficient palaeo-environmental records, the vegetation history and hydrology of the Tibetan Plateau during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are uncertain. Pollen extracted from sediment archives is an important proxy for past vegetation and climate reconstructions, and the relative abundances of pollen compositions (percentages or square-root transformed percentages) are usually employed in numerical analyses and quantitative reconstructions. The Tibetan Plateau is mainly covered by non-forest vegetation, including alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert, and the modern pollen assemblages from the core high-elevation areas are dominated by herbaceous pollen taxa such as Cyperaceae, Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, and Poaceae; while the arboreal pollen taxa have quite low abundance generally. However, arboreal pollen grains occur at high percentages in fossil pollen assemblages collected from the central Tibetan Plateau, particularly in samples with low pollen concentrations from the glacial period. Unfortunately, this can lead to problematical results when past vegetation and climate estimations are based solely on pollen percentages ignoring the variation in pollen concentrations. Many lakes are distributed across the Tibetan Plateau (ca. 1400 lakes with an area larger than 1 km2), and they are potentially ideal archives for many environmental proxies to investigate past environmental changes. Although past environmental records on the Tibetan Plateau using lacustrine sediments are abundant, most of these records are restricted to within the Holocene or the last 20 cal ka BP, while only a few records cover the last glacial-interglacial cycle entirely."

In this study, we obtained a lacustrine sediment core covering the last 33.8 cal ka BP (with reliable chronology) from a small lake (Koucha Lake) on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. We investigated the changes in vegetation and hydrology based on pollen data (including aquatic pollen and algae spores) together with measurements of total nitrogen (TN) and total organic carbon (TOC) to determine the history of vegetation and hydrology during the late stage of MIS 3 and the LGM for the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau."

                "In March 2003, a core of 560 cm length (reaching the glacial drift layer; called KC-03 in this study) was obtained from a water depth of 4.1 m from Koucha Lake, and a series of proxies analysed to investigate the histories of the lake's ecosystem and terrestrial environment since ca. 16.7 cal ka BP. Hence a second core of 316 cm (also reaching the glacial drift layer; called KC-19) was drilled from the lake centre at a water depth of 7 m (34.0105/C14 N, 97.2345/C14 E) in January 2019 using Austria's UWITEC platform coring equipment. The core was subsampled at 1 cm intervals, providing 316 samples in total and samples were preserved in the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior to analysis, all samples were freeze-dried. Sediment samples were analysed for pollen composition, TOC, and TN. Pollen analysis was completed on 96 samples at 3-cm intervals throughout the core, with sample weights ranging from 0.5 to 3 g depending on their pollen concentrations. One tablet of Lycopodium spores (27,637± 563 grains) was added to each sample prior to pollen extraction for calculating pollen concentration. Pollen grains were extracted using a procedure including treatments with 10% HCl, 10% NaOH, and 40% HF, followed by a 7-mm mesh sieving and acetolysis treatment (9:1 mixture of acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid)."

                    "Answer": "Accurate pollen concentration data can be challenging due to variations in pollen concentrations, which are particularly problematic when relying solely on pollen percentages for past vegetation and climate estimations. Additionally, the presence of high percentages of arboreal pollen grains in samples with low pollen concentrations from the glacial period could lead to misleading results.",

The reliance on one core might overlook localized differences in vegetation and climate history, limiting the comprehensive understanding of past environmental conditions.",
