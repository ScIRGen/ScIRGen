            "description": "The data are isotopic dating data, zircon HF-O isotopic data, rock whole rock major and trace data, rock whole rock isotopic geochemical data. The samples were collected from the early Paleozoic magmatic rocks in South Qiangtang, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Radioisotope geochronology data were obtained by analyzing zircon U-Pb isotopes with secondary ion microprobe. HF and O isotopes of minerals were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and secondary ion probe analysis, respectively. The major, trace and isotopic geochemical data of whole rock were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the whole rock isotopic geochemical data were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Based on the data obtained, the basement rocks and their formation history of Nanqiangtang are identified.",

                    "Answer": "The instrumental procedures for collecting and analyzing isotopic data from magmatic rocks in the South Qiangtang, Tibetan Plateau, involve several steps. U-Pb isotopic data is obtained through secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), which analyzes zircon samples to determine their age. Hf isotopic data is collected using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), while O isotopic data is also analyzed using SIMS. Additionally, whole-rock major and trace element data are acquired using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These procedures impact the accuracy of the data by ensuring precise measurements of isotopic compositions, which are critical for identifying the basement rocks and understanding their formation history.",
