The whole rock samples are granite from Yingwuling deposit, including K-feldspar granite and biotite granite. Zircon is selected from  K-feldspar granite and biotite granite, cassiterite is selected from weathered ore bearing granite. The major and trace elements of whole rock are obtained by XRF and ICP-MS analysis, respectively，the F content is obtained by ion electrode analysis, and the Cl content is obtained by ion chromatography analysis, and the Sr-Nd isotopic composition is obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. In situ U-Pb ages and trace elements of zircon and in situ U-Pb ages of cassiterite were obtained by LA-ICP-MS. In situ Hf isotopic compositions of zircons were obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals (Ore Geology Reviews), and the data are true and reliable. The petrogenesis of the Yingwuling pluton and the relationship between granite magmatism and W-Sn mineralization can be discussed based on the data obtained.",

                "Numerous Late Cretaceous W–Sn deposits associated with granitic rocks were developed in the southern part of South China. However, the relationship among granitic magma, mineralization and tectonic setting remains disputed. A large number of non-ferrous metal deposits, especially W–Sn deposits, occurred in the Mesozoic in South China, accounting for more than 50 % and 20 % of world’s total W and Sn reserves, respectively. These W–Sn deposits are usually related to granitic magmatic activity and are mainly generated in the Middle Jurassic and Late Cretaceous. The Yingwuling W–Sn polymetallic deposit is located in the western part of the Yangchun basin, the southernmost part of South China. South China is composed of the Cathaysia block to the southeast and the Yangtze block to the northwest. The Yingwuling W–Sn polymetallic deposit is situated in the southwest part of the Yangchun basin. The Yingwuling pluton intruded into the Upper Devonian strata, resulting in extensive skarn. The Yingwuling pluton shows A-type granite affinity, indicating that it was formed in an extensional environment."

The Yingwuling pluton shows A-type granite affinity, and is further classified as A2-type granite.
