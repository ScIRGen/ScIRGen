            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with ALOS PALSAR was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jun. 10, 2008.\n    The data were in FBS mode and HH/HV polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 23:39 BJT. Observations were carried out in plots A, B, C, D and E, which were divided into 6×6 subsites, with each one spanning a 120×120 m2 plot. Soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer were measured in A, B and C; the soil temperature, soil moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer in D and E.\n    Data were archived in Excel file. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",
