Max value composition (MVC) method was used to synthesize monthly LAI products on the surface using the reflectivity data of Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and sentinel 2 channels from Red and NIR channels. The data are synthesized monthly through Google Earth Engine cloud platform, and the missing pixels are interpolated by calculating the index of the model. The quality of the data is good, and it can be used in environmental change monitoring and other fields.",
