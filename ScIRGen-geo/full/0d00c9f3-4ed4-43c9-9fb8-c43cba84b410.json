            "description": "This data is SR Nd isotopic geochemical data of Yanshanian intermediate acid rocks in the northern margin of North China and its adjacent areas. SR Nd isotope data were obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. Some data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. SR Nd isotopic data can find out the variation law of isotopic composition in the study area. It is an important part of Geochemistry and geochronology. It is one of the most important tracing means to explore rock genesis and crust mantle evolution. This data can provide a trace of the magma source area in the northern margin of North China and its adjacent areas. It is an effective way to explore the genesis of intermediate acid rocks in this area, and provide support and help for the further study of regional geodynamic mechanism.",
