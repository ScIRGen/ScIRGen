            "description": "The North China Plain is an important food production area in China, with a large area of cropland and a complex planting structure. Accurately identifying the distribution of typical crops in this area and tracking the dynamic changes of planting structure are fundamental for detecting crop growth, evaluating crop irrigation water consumption and optimizing agricultural water resources allocation.\n    This study used Fourier transform to obtatin the amplitudes and phases of the 0-5 harmonics of the MOD13Q1 NDVI data. Based on the field sample points and maximum likelihood supervised classification, the planting area of 6 typical crops (winter wheat-summer maize; winter wheat-rice; other double cropping systems; spring maize; cotton; other single cropping systems) in the North China Plain from 2001 to 2018 was identified. The identification results accuracy were evaluated  through confusion matrix, comparison with the winter wheat planting area in the county-level statistical yearbook, and comparison with the proportion of winter wheat extracted by Landsat images, all of which showed good performance and high accuracy.\n    The data can be applied to related research and analysis on crop production, irrigation water consumption estimation, and groundwater protection in the North China Plain.",
            "instructions": "(1) Data naming: The distribution map of crop planting areas is stored in raster data format (tif file), and the file name is \"classresult_13q1_XX.tif\", where \"calssresult_13q1\" represents the classification result using MOD13Q1 NDVI data, and \"XX\" is the year , spanning from 2001 to 2018, one picture per year. For example, \"classresult_13q1_2001.tif\" is the distribution map of crop planting areas in the North China Plain in 2001, which contains typical 6 types of crop distribution grids.\n(2) Data usage method: All tifs in the dataset can be loaded directly with ArcGIS software. You can also use the \"geotiffread\" command in Matlab software to read. Each crop planting area distribution map is 3303 (row) × 3930 (column), and the grid is 0.0025 degrees. The grid value is 0-6, 0 is non-cultivated area, and 1-6 corresponds to 6 types of crops.",

                "The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the largest food production areas in China, where cropland takes up more than 80% of this region. Winter wheat and summer maize rotational cultivation is the typical cropping mode, and approximately 75% and 35% of China’s wheat and maize are produced in this region. However, crop water consumption (i.e., evapotranspiration (ET)) is usually higher than precipitation in the winter wheat growing season because of the high crop water consumption and uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation. The multi-year average seasonal ET during the wheat and maize seasons is around 238 mm and 221 mm, respectively, while the respective precipitation is only around 169 mm and 410 mm in the NCP. Thus, irrigation mainly from groundwater or rivers is necessary to favor crop production. However, continuous pumping from groundwater has caused serious overexploitation which led to a dramatic declining trend of groundwater table, especially in the Hebei Plain in the north part of the NCP over the past 40 years. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of providing timely, large coverage and repetitive information and low cost or even free, making it a useful tool to cropland mapping. However, the land use types and cropping systems in the NCP are complicated, manifested by fragmented cropland resulted from highly intensive villages, small towns, and build-up areas with high industrial intensity; various cropping systems and seasonal dynamic patterns caused by the household contract responsivity system which enables peasants to autonomously choose crop species and cultivated time in their fields; the inter-annual fluctuant cropping systems affected by market prices, policies and climate conditions. These complicated tempo-spatial characteristics make large-scale and long-term remote sensing mapping of winter wheat-summer maize remains a challenge."

The original NDVI data were preprocessed and transformed to the amplitude and phase values by Fourier analysis to be used as the base map for classification. The field survey sites were enriched and eliminated to obtain the final classification sample points. Three classification schemes with different sample categories and temporal resolution of NDVI data were designed and the maximum likelihood supervised classification was applied to discriminate winter wheat and summer maize during 2001 – 2018. The accuracy of the results was evaluated at pixels, county, and regional scales. About the regional level, Landsat images were employed to extract the proportion of winter wheat and summer maize planting area by the threshold method and compared them with the result from MODIS data."
