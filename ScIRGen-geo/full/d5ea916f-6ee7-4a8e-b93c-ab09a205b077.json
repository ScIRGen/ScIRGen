                    "Answer": "Soil bulk density refers to the mass of soil per unit volume, often expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cmÂ³). It is an important parameter for understanding soil compaction and porosity. In agricultural research, soil bulk density is typically measured using the ring knife method, where a known volume of soil is extracted with a ring, dried, and weighed to determine the density.",

In contrast, soil bulk density sampling is conducted up to 100 cm depth and utilizes the ring knife method for measurement.",
