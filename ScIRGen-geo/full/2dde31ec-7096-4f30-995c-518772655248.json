                    "Answer": "Utilizing NDWI water body index extraction from Landsat imagery every three years helps to reduce the influence of seasonal changes and maximize available data, potentially leading to more accurate and consistent measurements of lake area changes over time. However, this approach may also miss shorter-term fluctuations and trends, impacting the granularity and immediate applicability of the findings for studies on rapid environmental changes.",

Every three years, data is collected to maximize the availability of usable images. The NDWI water index is applied to extract water bodies, followed by manual visual inspection and editing for each lake to ensure accuracy and reliability. The data is projected in WGS84 and is in vector format.",
