            "description": "The accuracy of tropical cyclone (tropical storm) track forecasting improved by nearly 50% for lead times of 24–72 h since 1990s. Over the same period forecasting of tropical cyclone intensity showed only limited improvement. Given the limited prediction skill of models of tropical cyclone intensity based on environmental properties, there have been a wealth of studies of the role of internal dynamical processes of tropical cyclones, which are largely linked to precipitation properties and convective processes. The release of latent heat by convection in the inner core of a tropical cyclone is considered crucial to tropical cyclone intensification. 16-year satellite-based precipitation, and clouds top infrared brightness temperature were used to explore the relationship between precipitation, convective cloud, and tropical cyclone intensity change.  The 6-hourly TC centers were linearly interpolated to give the hourly and half hourly tropical cyclone center positions, to match the temporal resolution of the precipitation and clouds top infrared brightness temperature.\nMore precipitation is found as storms intensify, while tropical cyclone 24 h future intensity change is closely connected with very deep convective clouds with IR BT < 208 K. Intensifying tropical cyclones follow the occurrence of colder clouds with IR BT < 208 K with greater areal extents. As an indicator of very deep convective clouds, IR BT < 208 K is suggested to be a good predictor of tropical cyclone intensity change（Ruan&Wu，2018，GRL）. The properties of the satellite-based precipitation, and clouds top infrared brightness temperature are therefore suggested to be important measurements to study tropical cyclone intensity, intensity change and their underlying mechanisms. The high resolution of the satellite-based precipitation (3h), and cloud top infrared brightness temperature (half hour) datasets also makes them possible to be used to study tropical cyclone variability associated with diurnal cycle.",
            "instructions": "The data is in NC format, and each tropical cyclone is a file. The tropical cyclones in each year are listed in order of occurrence, such as 2001_ 2. NC is the data related to the second tropical cyclone in the ocean basin in 2001. Each document includes the basic information of tropical cyclone, such as longitude and latitude, time, maximum sustained wind speed and name of tropical cyclone, spatial distribution of infrared cloud top brightness temperature and rainfall within 500km of tropical cyclone center, as well as longitude and latitude distribution of corresponding space.\nIn order to match the satellite data, the location of the track center is interpolated to every hour. The rainfall data corresponding to tropical cyclones is calculated based on TRMM satellite observation and cloud top brightness temperature data corresponding to tropical cyclones are calculated based on multi-source orbit determination infrared satellite.\nIt is divided into two folders according to the North Indian Ocean and the South Indian Ocean.

                "The accuracy of tropical cyclone (TC) track forecasting improved by nearly 50% for lead times of 24–72 h between 1990 and 2008; over the same period forecasting of TC intensity showed only limited improvement. Although it is well known that TC intensification occurs more readily under conditions of higher sea surface temperature, lower vertical wind shear, and higher low troposphere moisture, and these environments are critically important to the prediction of TC intensity change in general and more specifically rapid intensification (RI), studies have shown that these environmental conditions alone are not sufficient to explain changes in TC intensity. Given the limited prediction skill of models of TC intensity based on environmental properties, there have been a wealth of studies of the role of internal dynamical processes of TCs, which are largely linked to precipitation properties and convective processes. The release of latent heat by convection in the inner core of a TC is considered crucial to TC intensification. Through analysis of an 11 year Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data set, Jiang (2012) found that extremely intense convection in the inner core increases the possibility of RI, but the difference is not substantial. Using the same data set, Jiang and Ramirez (2013) found that rapidly intensifying TCs are associated with a large area of rainfall with heavy rain in the inner core. By compositing 22 year passive microwave satellite overpasses, Harnos and Nesbitt (2011) detected a convective ring forming 6 h before the onset of RI. Using a 14 year TRMM precipitation radar (PR) data set, Tao and Jiang (2015) found that RI is more likely to be caused by shallow-moderate precipitation, while moderate to very deep convection observed during an RI is more likely to be a response. With two more years of TRMM PR data, Tao et al. (2017) claimed that RI follows significant increases in the occurrence and coverage of stratiform rain, thus stressing the importance of this type of rainfall. In a comparison with TCs with slow intensification rates, Alvey et al. (2015) used 15 year multisatellite passive microwave data to show that storms with higher intensification rates have more symmetric distributions and a larger overall coverage of precipitation prior to the onset of intensification. Satellite-based statistical studies can be used to draw more robust conclusions through analysis of more data sets. However, consensus on the importance of different properties of convection on TC intensity change, especially RI, has not yet been reached despite the extensive use of satellite data by the authors of these cited works. The extent to which convection is a precursor, or simply a reflection of other processes occurring during RI, is also unclear. Studying the diurnal variations in TC convective cloud systems for the period 2000–2013, Wu and Ruan (2016) found that clouds with IR BT< 208 K have a maximum coverage in the morning, and clouds with 208 K< IR BT < 240 K have a maximum coverage in the afternoon. An IR BT of 208 K was chosen as a threshold to identify very deep convection within IR data. Clouds with IR BT < 208 K and 208 K< IR BT < 240 K are termed “very cold deep convective clouds” and “cold high clouds,” respectively, influenced by different diurnal cycles. Different diurnal cycles and different underlying physical mechanisms associated with these two types of TC clouds suggest that they might play different roles in TC intensity change."

The 6-hourly records of the position of the TC center, the intensity of the TC, and other important parameters were included in the best-track data, typically at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. The 6-hourly TC centers were linearly interpolated to give the 3-hourly and hourly TC center positions, to match the temporal resolution of the precipitation and IR BT data, respectively. A total of 437 storms in the western North Pacific were analyzed for the period 2000–2015. The precipitation data used in this paper are rates of rainfall from the NASA TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA). The TMPA operational product used in this paper is 3B42 (version 7) and has a horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° between 50°N and 50°S, with a temporal resolution of 3 h. Half-hourly global merged IR BT data were obtained from the United States National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Prediction Center. The IR BT data have a pixel size of 4 km by 4 km between 60°N and 60°S. The half-hourly IR BT data were averaged to hourly data to fill gaps in the data. All precipitation and IR BT images were evaluated in terms of TC intensity (maximum sustained wind) and 24 h future intensity changes. All satellite images must show the best-track position 300 km or more away from land to remove any influence from it. The wind fields were obtained from the 0.75° resolution European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis data set. In this paper, each image is evaluated using wind shear relative coordinates, with wind shear defined as the difference between 850 and 200 hPa winds averaged at a radius of 200–800 km from the TC center. The 6-hourly wind shear data were linearly interpolated to give hourly data to match the temporal resolution of IR BT data."
