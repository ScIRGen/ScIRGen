Using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, it generates optimal fields of land surface states (e.g., soil moisture and surface temperature) and fluxes.The model simulation was initialized by using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year.The GLDAS air temperature data are\ncompared with high-resolution gridded Daymet data and land surface station dataBased on air temperature data from 2001 to 2016, GEE was used to tailor the masks of key nodes in Southeast Asia and middle East. Finally, the 16-day synthetic air temperature dataset of 34 key nodes from 2001 to 2016 was obtained.\"",

Therefore, accurate, high-resolution estimates of terrestrial water and energy storages are valuable for predicting climate change, weather, biological and agricultural productivity, and flooding, and for performing a wide array of studies in the broader biogeosciences. In particular, terrestrial stores of energy and water modulate fluxes between the land and atmosphere and exhibit persistence on diurnal, seasonal, and interannual time scales. Furthermore, because soil moisture, temperature, and snow are integrated states, biases in land surface forcing data and parameterizations accumulate as errors in the representations of these states in operational numerical weather forecast and climate models and their associated coupled data assimilation systems. A Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) has been developed jointly by scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in order to produce such fields. Through innovation and an ever-improving conceptualization of the physics underlying earth system processes, LSMs have continued to evolve and to display an improved ability to simulate complex phenomena."

The soil parameter maps used in GLDAS were derived from the 5' resolution global soils dataset of Reynolds et al. (2000). GLDAS uses a global 30-arc-s resolution topographic map (GTOP030; Verdin and Greenlee 1996) as its standard. GLDAS estimates global, downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes at the land surface using a procedure and cloud and snow products from the Air Force Weather Agency's (AFWA) Agricultural Meteorology modeling system (AGRMET). Near-real-time satellite-derived precipitation data are obtained from groups at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and at GSFC for forcing GLDAS."
