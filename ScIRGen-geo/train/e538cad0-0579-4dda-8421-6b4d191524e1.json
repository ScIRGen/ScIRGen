            "description": "Spring lake, hongshan lake area foraminifera biological chart contains a chart I, II and III, a total of three chart.Chart shows the inside from west kunlun region group at the top of the formation of iron long beach, a total of 10 kinds of planktonic foraminifera.The era of planktonic foraminifera represents the longtan group of Marine limestone iron deposit end time, also represents the time of the water in the region retreat.This time also can be used to restrict the starting time of uplift of the west kunlun area.Chart inside of planktonic foraminifera photo is through the field sample collection, rock chips grinding, species identification and photographic under a microscope and a series of process.Due to the sample of planktonic foraminifera low abundance, strong reformation and diagenesis, so the poor preservation of the foraminifera.Still, we identified the Globotruncana falsostuarti, g. cf. Linneiana, g. cf. Ventricosa, Planohedbergella prairiehillensis, p. cf. Yaucoensis, Pseudotextularia nuttalli, Planoheterohelix globulosa, p. cf. Praenuttalli, Muricohedbergella holmdelensis and Whiteinella brittnensis etc. A total of 10 kinds of foraminifera.Limited by the foraminifera iron longtan group of sedimentary end time for ~ 76-66 Ma.Compared with previous work, our research extend the time of the water in the region retreat for nearly 10 ma.This work has been published in SCI journal Palaeoworld.It will also become one of the basis of studying the plateau uplift of the region.",

                    "Answer": "In the Xikunku Lunshan spring water lake and Hongshan Lake region, the data collection methods involve field sample collection, rock thin section preparation, species identification under a microscope, and photography. Challenges include low abundance of planktonic foraminifera and significant diagenetic alteration, which result in poor preservation. These challenges may differ in other regions depending on local conditions, affecting the abundance and preservation quality of samples.",

                    "Answer": "The poor preservation of planktonic foraminifera is influenced by their low abundance and the strong diagenetic alteration of samples. This necessitates the use of specific data collection methods such as field sample collection, rock thin section preparation, and species identification under a microscope, which can be time-consuming and challenging due to these preservation issues.",

                    "Answer": "The low abundance and strong diagenetic alteration of samples can lead to poor preservation of planktonic foraminifera, making it challenging to identify species accurately. Despite these challenges, it is possible to identify a limited number of species, such as the 10 species identified in the region, which can still provide valuable insights into the sedimentation period and the timing of sea retreat in the area.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of documenting planktonic foraminifera species from the Late Cretaceous period in the Western Kunlun Mountains is to determine the end deposition time of the marine limestone in the Tielongtan Group and to establish the timing of the sea retreat in the area. This information is crucial for defining the initiation of surface uplift in the Western Kunlun region. The study extends the known sea retreat time by nearly 10 million years compared to previous research, and it serves as a foundation for future studies on plateau uplift in the region.",
