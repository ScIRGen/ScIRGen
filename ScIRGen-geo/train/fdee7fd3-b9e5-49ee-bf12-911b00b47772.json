            "description": "Residual bay basin was developed during the transition from marine to continental deposition in the Qiangtang Basin. This transition environment enables Qiangtang Basin to generate organic-rich shales. The mechanism of organic matter accumulation is still controversial due to its complicated organism origin. In this study, we choose residual bay organic-rich shales from the Changliang Mountain section to study the mechanism of organic material accumulation. Redox-sensitive indices including EF values, Mn contents and U/Th ratios reveal that the water volume was dyoxic to anoxic condition during the shale deposition. The relatively low primary productivity during deposition is supported by the relatively low biogenic barium concentrations. Climate change indices including oxygen-isotope, Mg/Ca and Fe/Mn ratio show that a significant climatic change has taken place during the shale deposition. Climate has changed into warm and humid during the shale deposition compared with dry and cold during underlying marl deposition. Combined with sedimentary rate and type II kerogen, this paper proposed that warm and humid climate conditions, relatively high sedimentation rate, and high input from terrigenous higher plants are the main factors controlling organic matter accumulation in the Changliang Mountain shales.",

                    "Answer": "The main objective is to investigate the mechanisms of organic matter enrichment in oil shales within transitional environments like residual bays. This involves analyzing factors such as redox conditions, initial productivity of surface waters during the depositional period, climate characteristics, and sedimentation rates, which collectively help identify the primary controlling factors for organic matter enrichment. The study suggests that instead of common factors like good preservation conditions or high paleoproductivity, warm humid climate conditions, relatively fast sedimentation rates, and high terrestrial organic matter input are the dominant factors contributing to organic matter enrichment in the southwestern part of the North Qiangtang Basin during the Early Cretaceous.",

                    "Question": "What procedures are involved in collecting and analyzing geochemical data from oil shale samples in the early Cretaceous period in the Qiangtang Basin?",
                    "Answer": "The procedures involve collecting oil shale samples from the southwestern part of the Qiangtang Basin, specifically from oil shale and its underlying and overlying marl in the Changliangshan area. The total organic carbon content (TOC) analysis is conducted at the Wuxi Petroleum Geology Institute of Sinopec Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development using the national standard GB 17378.5-2007. Major elements are tested using an AB104L, Axios-max wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer following the standard GB/T 14506.14-2010. Trace elements are analyzed using a DRC-E inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer according to the standard GB/T 14506.30-2010. All major and trace element testing is completed at the Nuclear Industry Geological Analysis and Testing Research Center. The focus of the research is to understand the mechanism of organic matter enrichment in oil shale within transitional environments such as residual bays by analyzing lithology, sedimentary facies, paleontology characteristics, and factors like redox conditions, initial productivity of surface water during the sedimentary period, climate features, and sedimentation rates. It concludes that organic matter enrichment is mainly controlled by warm, humid climate conditions, relatively fast sedimentation rates, and high terrestrial organic matter input, rather than conventional preservation conditions or high past productivity.",
