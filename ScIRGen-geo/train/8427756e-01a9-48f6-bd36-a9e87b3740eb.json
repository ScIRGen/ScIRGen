            "description": "Based on the historical daily maximum temperature data and reanalysis data set of stations, a daily maximum temperature statistical downscaling model based on first-order autoregressive and multiple linear regression models is developed. Driven by the IPCC cmip6 scenario data of the global climate model (cnrm-cm6-1), the statistical downscaling model predicts the number of five heat wave indexes (heat wave events) of 65 stations in Central Asia from 2015 to 2100 (HWM), heat wave frequency (HWF), heat wave intensity (HWM), maximum duration of heat wave (HWD), heat wave amplitude (HWA)). Finally, the heat wave change scenario data sets of 65 stations in Central Asia under four emission scenarios (ssp126, ssp245, ssp370, ssp585) from 2015 to 2100 were obtained.",
