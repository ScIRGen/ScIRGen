Portable soil sensors like the POGO are used to measure soil temperature, moisture, loss tangent, soil conductivity, and the real and imaginary parts of the soil permittivity. A needle thermometer is employed to obtain the average soil temperature at 0-5 cm depth, while a handheld infrared thermometer is used to collect surface radiation temperature readings three times. These steps ensure synchronized microwave and ground observation data for soil moisture and temperature analysis.",
