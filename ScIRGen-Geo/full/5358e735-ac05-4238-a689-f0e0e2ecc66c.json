      "description": "The data comes from the 4th China Urban Rural Elderly Population Survey, which used multi-level and stratified sampling methods to survey 224142 representative elderly people aged 60 and above nationwide. We used the data from the 4th China Urban Rural Elderly Population Survey to study the situation of CCVD among the elderly. We used univariate and multivariate logistic proportional regression analysis to explore risk factors, and then incorporated them into a multivariate linear regression model to identify independent predictors of CCVD. Evaluate disease management based on the self reported diagnosis, treatment, and medical history of participants with CCVD. Result: After excluding samples with missing data, 215041 participants were included in the analysis. The overall incidence of CCVD is 26%. Living in rural areas, being elderly, female, with low education, smoking, lack of sleep, widowhood, living alone, lack of exercise, poor economic status, and not participating in public welfare projects are the main risk factors for CCVD among elderly people in China (P<0.05). In a multifactor linear regression model, keeping other factors unchanged, the occurrence of CCVD is still related to 'urban and rural'（ β= 0.012, P<0.001), \"Age\"（ β=- 0.003, P<0.001), \"Gender\"（ β=- 0.022, P<0.001), \"Education level\"（ β=- 0.017, P<0.001), \"Marital status\"（ β= 0.004, P=0.047), \"Smoking\"（ β= 0.012, P=0.003), \"Drinking\"（ β=- 0.015, P=0.001) and \"Sleep“（ β= 0.008, P=0.005). There is no collinearity issue among these factors. Conclusion: The main risk factors affecting the occurrence of CCVD among elderly people in China include rural residence, female gender, low education level, poor sleep treatment, bereavement, unmarried, living alone, lack of exercise, poor economic status, and lack of participation in social and public welfare projects. China urgently needs to improve national policies to prevent, control, and manage risk factors for CCVD in the elderly.",
      "descriptionCn": "数据来源于第4次中国城乡老年人口调查使用多级、分层采样方法对全国范围224142位60岁以上具有代表性的老年人进行了调查。我们利用第4次中国城乡老年人口调查数据来研究老年人中CCVD情况，使用单因素和多因素logistic比例回归分析探索危险因素，然后将危险因素纳入多变量线性回归模型来识别CCVD的独立预测因素。根据患有CCVD的参与者自行报告的诊断、治疗和就诊病史来评估疾病管理情况。结果：在排除数据缺失的样本之后，215041例参与者纳入分析。总的CCVD发生率为26%。居住在农村、年老、女性、低学历、吸烟、睡眠不足、丧偶、独居、缺少锻炼、经济状况差、没有参与公共福利项目是中国老年人CCVD的主要危险因素（P<0.05）。在多因素线性回归模型中，保持其他因素不变，CCVD的发生仍然与“城乡”（β=0.012，P<0.001）、”年龄”（β=-0.003，P<0.001）、“性别”（β=-0.022，P<0.001）、“受教育水平”（β=-0.017，P<0.001）、“婚姻状况”（β=0.004，P=0.047）、“吸烟”（β=0.012，P=0.003）、“饮酒”（β=-0.015，P=0.001）和”睡眠“（β=0.008，P=0.005）相关。在这些因素中没有共线性问题。结论：影响中国老年人CCVD发生的主要危险因素包括：农村居住、女性、低文化水平、睡眠治疗差、丧亲、未婚、独居、缺少锻炼、经济状况差以及未参与社会公共福利项目。中国亟需改进国家政策来预防、控制和管理老年人CCVD危险因素。",

        "An aging population is an essential national condition throughout China in the 21st century. By the end of 2014, the number of people aged 60 years or older in China had reached 212 million, accounting for 15.5% of the total population. According to the National Strategy Research Group of the Office of the China Working Commission on Aging, the number of older adults in China will peak at 487 million by 2053, accounting for 34.9% of the total population. This rapidly growing aging population will exert a long-term and profound impact on China’s economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological progress. Cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CCVD) is a common chronic vascular disease in the elderly. The death toll caused by CCVD accounts for about 40.27% of the total mortality in the country. According to current trends, by 2030, the prevalence of coronary heart disease in China will have increased by 3.7 times compared with 2000. According to the 2018 China Cardiovascular Disease Report, there are 290 million patients with CCVD in China, including 13 million with stroke and 11 million with coronary heart disease. The Stroke Screening Project showed that, in 2014, the prevalence of stroke among adults older than 40 years in China was 2.06%. Strokes can be divided into hemorrhagic strokes, caused by a sudden rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, and ischemic strokes, caused by a blockage of a blood vessel, which is opposed to each other. The subtypes of stroke are intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral ischemia. The mortality rate due to coronary heart disease was higher among men than women. Smoking dramatically increases people’s risk of other CCVD events. The incidence of CCVD increases with population changes. Age remains the most significant irreversible risk factor for CCVD. However, modifiable factors related to diet, lifestyle, physical activity, and psychosocial conditions also play a key role in the occurrence and development of CCVD. An analysis of 31,343 elderly individuals published in 2017 pointed out that old-age frailty is closely related to CCVD and constitutes a changeable risk factor for CCVD in the elderly. There is considerable evidence to suggest that aging is an actual new disease in the 21st century and that it plays a vital role in developing CCVD."

        "We conducted the 4th Survey of the Aged Population in Urban and Rural China (SSAPUR) among a large, nationally representative sample of elderly Chinese individuals aged 60 years or more to estimate the prevalence of CCVD in this age group. Furthermore, we researched risk factors for prevalent CCVD and documented the current management of CCVD among the Chinese elderly. The purpose of our study was to provide vital data necessary to decrease the prevalence rate of CCVD among the elderly in China. Chinese national policies for preventing, controlling, and managing risk factors for CCVD in the elderly must be urgently developed."

        "老龄化人口是21世纪中国一个重要的国家现象。到2014年底，中国60岁及以上的人口已达到2.12亿，占总人口的15.5%。根据中国老龄工作委员会办公室国家战略研究小组的预测，到2053年，中国老年人口将达到4.87亿，占总人口的34.9%。这一快速增长的老龄化人口将对中国的经济、政治、文化、社会和生态进步产生长期而深远的影响。心脑血管疾病（CCVD）是老年人常见的慢性血管疾病。因心脑血管疾病导致的死亡人数约占全国总死亡人数的40.27%。根据当前趋势，到2030年，中国冠心病的患病率将比2000年增加3.7倍。根据2018年中国心血管疾病报告，中国有2.9亿心脑血管疾病患者，其中包括1300万中风患者和1100万冠心病患者。中风筛查项目显示，2014年中国40岁以上成年人中风的患病率为2.06%。中风可分为出血性中风（由脑血管突然破裂引起）和缺血性中风（由血管堵塞引起），两者相对立。中风的亚型包括脑内出血、蛛网膜下腔出血和脑缺血。冠心病的死亡率在男性中高于女性。吸烟显著增加人们发生其他心脑血管事件的风险。心脑血管疾病的发生率随着人口变化而增加。年龄仍然是心脑血管疾病最重要的不可逆风险因素。然而，与饮食、生活方式、身体活动和心理社会条件相关的可改变因素在心脑血管疾病的发生和发展中也起着关键作用。2017年对31,343名老年人的分析指出，老年虚弱与心脑血管疾病密切相关，并构成老年人心脑血管疾病的可改变风险因素。有大量证据表明，老龄化在21世纪实际上是一种新疾病，并在心脑血管疾病的发展中发挥着重要作用。"
