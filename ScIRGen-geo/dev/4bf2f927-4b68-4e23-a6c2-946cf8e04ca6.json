            "titleEn": "Paleoelevation dataset of different periods on the Tibetan Plateau (Since 56 Ma)",
            "description": "The quantification of the Tibetan Plateau’s (TP) paleoelevation is a pivotal connection between the investigation of surface uplift, deep earth dynamics, and climatology. High-precision paleogeographic data can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the process and mechanisms of the TP’s uplift. Applicated in paleoclimate simulations can render the results more reliable. Based on the regression model, paleogeographic and paleotemperature data, the paleoelevation dataset of six important time nodes in the Tibetan Plateau since 56 Ma are calculated with a spatial resolution of 0.1 °. This dataset has important scientific significance and research value for an in-depth understanding of the historical pattern of paleogeographic evolution and paleoclimate research of the TP.",
            "instructions": " The datasets are stored as follows: there are separate folders for each model (Linear regression model and Polynomial regression model), and within each model folder, the paleoelevation dataset for six important time nodes (Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene, LGM, and MOD) are stored. Within each folder, the data name is organized by TP_YY_paleoelevation_XX.tif, where yy represents the name of different historical periods, XX represents the name of different models (e.g., the name of the paleoelevation data of Eocene calculated by the linear regression model on the Tibetan Plateau: TP_Eocene_paleoelevation_LRM.tif). The datasets are in NetCDF format and can be opened and read using the ArcGIS software. Data reading method: The datasets are in TIF format and can be opened and read using the ArcGIS software.",
