            "description": "This data set is the tin isotopic composition data of cassiterite and  stannite. The samples were mainly from South Dakota, USA; Cornwall, England; There are four tin metallogenic belts with different metallogenic environments in Germany, Czech Republic and Andean tin belt in Bolivia. The tin isotopic compositions of cassiterite and  stannite were determined by ICP-MS. The data has been used in the publication of articles, and the data quality is high and reliable. Based on the data obtained, the variation of Sn isotopic composition reflects the original Sn isotopic composition of the deposit, which proves that the cassiterite formed in the early stage is related to the change of source or magmatic process, and tin isotope can provide information about redox reaction and rock source and process.",

                    "Answer": "Tin isotope fractionation refers to the variation in the tin isotopic composition that can occur during geological processes. In the context of understanding mineralization environments, it involves measuring the tin isotopic composition of minerals such as cassiterite and stannite using techniques like plasma mass spectrometry. This data can reflect the original tin isotopic composition of ore deposits and provide insights into redox reactions, as well as the source and processes of the rocks.",
