            "description": "including muscovite granite with the occurrence of wolframite,muscovite granite with Nb⁃Ta⁃W oxide minerals and pegmatite with the occurrence of columbite⁃group minerals. Meanwhile,the typical muscovite granite without any rare ⁃ metal minerals (barren muscovite granite hereafter) is selected for comparison. Major and trace elements of whole rock geochemistry, the occurrence, major and trace elements of rock forming minerals and accessory minerals are comparable. The whole rock compositions were analyzed by XRF adn ICP-MS. The chemical compositions of minerals were analyzed by EMP and LA-ICPMS. It is suggested that whole ⁃ rock composition is indicative for the fluid activity,while the composition characteristics of muscovite,tourmaline and garnet are indicative for the process and degree of the magma evolution.",
