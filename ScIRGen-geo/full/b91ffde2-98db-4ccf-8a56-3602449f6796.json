In contrast, the GLDAS system offers hydrological data derived from model simulations, such as surface and subsurface runoff, also with a monthly resolution but covering a shorter period from 1979 to 2019. Both datasets are suitable for long-term water resource research, but their different temporal spans and data types may influence the scope and depth of analysis in the Southeast Asia and Lancang-Mekong Basin regions.",

Variability in data collection standards, the integration of different data formats (e.g., nc format), and the reliance on global models like CRU TS v. 4.03 and GLDAS may also introduce complexities. Furthermore, the monthly time resolution necessitates careful management of temporal granularity to maintain accuracy and usability.",

                    "Answer": "Including both hydrological and meteorological data allows for a comprehensive analysis of water resource management by providing insights into historical trends and variability in precipitation, temperature, and runoff. This integrated dataset can improve the accuracy of water availability predictions, enhance the understanding of climate change impacts on regional water resources, and support the development of more effective management and conservation strategies.",

Additionally, hydrological data like surface and subsurface runoff are simulated from GLDAS, with data available from January 1979 to February 2019.

These systems provide data in a consistent format (nc) and with a monthly temporal resolution, covering extensive periods from 1901 to 2019, which facilitates comprehensive analysis and modeling.",
