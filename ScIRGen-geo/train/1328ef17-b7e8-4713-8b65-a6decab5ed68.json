            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of large aperture scintillator from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Two large aperture scintillation meters, bls450 and zzlas, are installed respectively. The site is located in donghuayuan Town, Huailai County, Hebei Province. The longitude and latitude of the observation point are 115.7880e, 40.3491n and 480m above sea level. The effective height of the large aperture scintillator is 14m, the optical path length is 1870m, the longitude and latitude of the transmitter are 115.8023e, 40.3596n, and the longitude and latitude of the receiver are 115.7825e and 40.3522n. The acquisition frequency of bls450 and zzlas is 5Hz and 1Hz respectively, with an average output of 1min.\nThe original data of large aperture scintillator is 1 min, and the released data is 30 min average data after processing and quality control. The sensible heat flux is mainly obtained by iterative calculation based on Monin obkhov similarity theory and combined with automatic weather station data. In the process of iterative calculation, for bls450, the stability function of thiermann and Grassl, 1992 is selected; for zzlas, the stability function of Andreas, 1988 is selected. The main quality control steps include: (1) eliminating the data of cn2 saturation; (2) eliminating the data with weak demodulation signal intensity; (3) eliminating the data of precipitation time and one hour before and after; (4) eliminating the data of weak turbulence under stable conditions (U * less than 0.1m/s).\nSeveral explanations about the published data are as follows: (1) the Las data is mainly bls450, and the missing time is supplemented by zzlas observation, and the missing time is marked with - 6999. (2) Data header: date / time: date / time, cn2: structure parameter of air refraction index (m-2 / 3), H_ Las: sensible heat flux (w / m2). The meaning of data time, for example, 0:30 represents the average of 0:00-0:30; the data is stored in *. XLS format.\nGuo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2013",

Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness only in the range of tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS aligns well with satellite pixel scales and the grid scales of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth for the pixel/grid scale of remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."
