            "description": "The dataset of the drop spectrometer (PARSIVEL) observations was obtained at an interval of 30 seconds in the arid region hydrology experiment area from May 18 to Jul. 5, 2008. The site was chosen in Xiaoman township (38.86°N, 100.41°E, 1515m), Ganzhou district, Zhangye city, Gansu province. The data mainly included the raindrop grain size and the terminal velocity. Besides, dual polarized radar (X-band) parameters such as ZDR and KDR could be further developed based on those data.\n     The sampling area of PARSIVEL was 5400mm^2; the liquid grain diameter was from 0.2-5mm, and the solid grain diameter was from 0.2-25mm.",
