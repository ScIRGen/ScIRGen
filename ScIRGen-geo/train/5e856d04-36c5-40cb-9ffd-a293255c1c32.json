            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Qinghai Lake integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient from April 26 to December 31 in 2019. The site (100°14'8.99\"E, 37°14'49.00\"N) was located in the south of Sanjiaocheng sheep breeding farm, Gangcha County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3210m.The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP155; 3, 5, 10 m, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (windsonic; 3, 5, 10m, towards north), air pressure (PTB110; 3 m), rain gauge (TE525M; towards north), four-component radiometer (CNR4; 6m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, towards south, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (PQS1; 6 m, towards south, each with one vertically downward and one vertically upward, soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates below the vegetation; -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (109; -0.05、-0.10、-0.20、-0.40、-0.80、-1.20、-2.00、-3.00 and -5.00m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.05、-0.10、-0.20、-0.40、-0.80、-1.20、-2.00、-3.00 and -5.00m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_3 m, Ta_5 m, Ta_10 m; RH_3 m, RH_5 m, RH_10 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_3 m, Ws_5 m, Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_3 m, WD_5 m, WD_10 m) (°), precipitation (rain) (mm), air pressure (press) (hpa), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_D_up and PAR_D_down) (μmol/ (s m-2)), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_5cm、Ts_10cm、Ts_20cm、Ts_40cm、Ts_80cm、Ts_120cm、Ts_200cm、Ts_300cm、Ts_400cm) (℃), soil moisture (Ms_5cm、Ms_10cm、Ms_20cm、Ms_40cm、Ms_80cm、Ms_120cm、Ms_200cm、Ms_300cm、Ms_400cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018/8/31 10:30.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of meteorological data collection, '气象要素梯度观测系统' refers to a system designed to measure various meteorological parameters at different heights or layers. This system typically includes sensors for wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity at multiple heights (e.g., 3m, 5m, 10m) to observe and analyze vertical gradients and variations in these elements within the atmosphere.",

                    "Answer": "The dataset provides gradient observations of wind speed, air temperature, and soil moisture at various heights and depths, offering insights into the interactions between atmospheric conditions and soil characteristics in temperate grasslands. For instance, variations in wind speed and direction at different heights can indicate patterns of air movement and their influence on temperature and moisture distribution. Similarly, the soil moisture data at multiple depths can reveal how surface conditions affect subsurface moisture levels, which may impact plant growth and soil health. These observations can help infer the dynamics of energy exchange and water cycles in these ecosystems, highlighting the role of atmospheric processes in shaping soil environments.",

Additionally, technical issues like power failures or data transmission errors may also contribute to inconsistencies in the dataset.",

Data processing includes ensuring 144 data points per day, eliminating duplicate records, and marking data with potential issues in red.",
