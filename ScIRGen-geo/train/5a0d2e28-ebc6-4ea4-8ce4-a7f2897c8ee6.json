            "description": "This data set includes the monthly average actual evapotranspiration of the Tibet Plateau from 2001 to 2018. The data set is based on the satellite remote sensing data (MODIS) and reanalysis meteorological data (CMFD), and is calculated by the surface energy balance system model (SEBS). In the process of calculating the turbulent flux, the sub-grid scale topography drag parameterization scheme is introduced to improve the simulation of sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition, the evapotranspiration of the model is verified by the observation data of six turbulence flux stations on the Tibetan Plateau, which shows high accuracy. The data set can be used to study the characteristics of land-atmosphere interaction and the water cycle in the Tibetan Plateau.",

                "As the birthplace of Asia’s major rivers, the Tibetan Plateau (TP), famous as the “Water Tower of Asia”, is essential to the Asian energy and water cycles (Immerzeel et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2012). Consuming around two-thirds of global terrestrial precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component that affects the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere (Oki and Kanae, 2006; Fisher et al., 2017). ET is also a key factor modulating regional and global weather and climate. Total evaporation from large lakes of the TP has been quantitatively estimated recently (B. Wang et al., 2020); however, the terrestrial ET on the TP and its spatial and temporal changes remain very uncertain. Although Epan and potential ET suggest the long-term variability in ET according to the complementary relationship (CR) between Epan and actual ET (ET a) (Zhang et al., 2007), these measures cannot precisely depict the spatial pattern of trends in ET a. Employing only routine meteorological observations without requiring any vegetation and soil information is the most significant advantage of CR models (Szilagyi et al., 2017). However, numerous assumptions and requirements of validations of key parameters limit the application and performance of CR models over different climate conditions. Satellite remote sensing (RS) provides temporally frequent and spatially contiguous measurements of land surface characteristics that affect ET, for example, land surface temperature, albedo, and vegetation index."

However, the fetch of the EC observation is on the order of hundreds of meters, thus impeding the ability to capture the plateau-scale variations in ET a. However, numerous assumptions and requirements of validations of key parameters limit the application and performance of CR models over different climate conditions. The SEBS-estimated ETa is at a resolution of around 10 km, while the footprint of EC-observed ETa values ranges from a few dozen meters to a few hundred meters. Note that the energy consumption related to freeze–thaw processes and sublimation is neglected. Thus, the dataset is likely to be less reliable over the glacier and permafrost and in the winter season."

In situ observations, satellite-based products, and meteorological forcing data were used in this study to estimate monthly ETa over the TP area.
