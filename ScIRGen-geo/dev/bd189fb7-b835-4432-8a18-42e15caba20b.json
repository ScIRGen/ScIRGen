Within CMIP6, the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) aims to generate multi-model climate projections for alternate scenarios of future emissions and land-use changes produced with integrated assessment models. The US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project is a new and ongoing climate modeling effort to develop a state-of-the-art Earth system model. The E3SM project aims to develop code optimized for DOE’s high-performance computing infrastructure and to advance Earth system prediction of changes in environmental variables that are critical to energy-sector decisions, such as regional trends in air and water temperatures, water availability, storms and heavy precipitation, coastal flooding, and sea-level rise (Bader et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020). E3SM version 1.0 (E3SMv1.0) at the standard horizontal resolution of ∼100 km reported a high ECS of 5.3 K, a high transient climate response (TCR) of 2.93 K, along with a strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFaero) of −1.65 W m−2 (Golaz et al., 2019). Previous estimates found that the net positive cloud feedback of 0.94 W m−2 K−1 in E3SMv1.0 is too strong compared with other CMIP6 models at the range of 0.42 ±0.36 W m−2 K−1 (Zelinka et al., 2020, Table S1)."

Secondly, we describe regional responses of key climate components in the GHG-only simulations. The difference between the high-emission all-forcing experiment and the GHG-only experiment is analyzed."

The GHG-only future projection simulations (future_Pn-SSP5-8.5-GHG) use the end of the historical_Hn simulations as the starting points and use the GHG forcing in the SSP5-8.5 scenario, while the other forcings are still set at the same pre-industrial values as historical_Hn-GHG."

The global mean precipitation in E3SMv1.0 increases by >0.3 mm d−1 from the end of the historical period (year 2014) to the end of the future projection (year 2099). The global mean Tair changes in the E3SMv1.0 ensemble members are comparable to the CMIP6 models with the highest warming. The global pattern of Tair change between 2070–2099 and 1985–2014 reveals a polar amplification of surface warming and interhemispheric asymmetric warming. The global mean precipitation increases by ∼10 % due to the warmer climate."
