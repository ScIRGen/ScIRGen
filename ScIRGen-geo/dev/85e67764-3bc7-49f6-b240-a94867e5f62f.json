            "titleEn": "Geochemical data set of late Jurassic granitoids in Guangzhou, South China",
            "description": "The data set includes: lithologic information, chronological data, whole rock major and trace elements and Sr-Nd isotopic data, and in-situ Hf-O isotopic data of zircons from the Huolushan and Longyandong two-mica granites, Huolushan diorites and Huolushan syenite porphyries in the Guangzhou area. The chronological data of rock samples are determined by SIMS of magmatic zircon separated from single mineral. During the testing process, Qinghu standard zircon is used as the monitoring sample to monitor the reliability of the whole analysis and testing process. The main elements were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) by melting the rock powder into a glass sheet which can be tested on the computer. The analytical accuracy of the standard materials GBW-07111, GBW-123, GSR-1, GSR-2 and GSR-3 was better than 2%. Trace elements were analyzed by Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). USGS reference materials (BHVO-2, GSR-1, GSR-2, GSR-3, SARM-4, AGV-2 and W-2a) were determined in the process of analysis and test, which were used as external test standards to correct the element content of unknown samples, and the accuracy of analysis and test was better than 3%. The SR Nd isotopic compositions of rocks were determined by means of acid dissolution of powders, and the obtained solutions were monitored by using NBS987 (87Sr / 86Sr = 0.71025) and shin Etsu JNdi-1 (143Nd / 144Nd = 0.512115) standard materials on the Neptune multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). The in-situ Hf isotope of zircon was measured by laser and MC-ICP-MS. During the test, Mud Tank and GJ-1 standard zircon were used as monitoring samples to monitor the reliability of the whole process. In situ O isotopic data of zircons were obtained by SIMS analysis of magmatic zircons. In the process of testing, the external accuracy of multiple determination results of Penglai standard sample is better than 0.30% (2σ). The obtained data provide evidence for the mechanism and process of Late Mesozoic crustal reworking in South China. The research results are published in the international well-known Journal LITHOS.",

The accuracy of measurements is ensured by comparing them with established standards such as GBW-07111 and USGS standards. Additionally, the isotopic analysis using MC-ICP-MS with standards like NBS987 for Sr and JNdi-1 for Nd, and the use of laser ablation coupled with MC-ICP-MS for in-situ Hf isotope measurements, also contribute to the reliability of the data. The consistent use of these standards and methodologies helps in maintaining the precision of the analysis and provides evidence for the crustal reconstruction processes of the Late Mesozoic in South China.",
