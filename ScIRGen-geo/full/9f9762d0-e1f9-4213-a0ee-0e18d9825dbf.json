            "description": "The data set includes the river level observation data of No. 4 point in the dense runoff observation of the middle reaches of Heihe River from May 20, 2015 to March 11, 2016. The instrument maintenance was completed again on May 20, 2015. The observation point is located in Heihe bridge, Shangbao village, Jing'an Township, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The riverbed is sandy gravel with unstable section. The longitude and latitude of the observation point are n39.065 °, e100.433056 °, 1431m above sea level, and 58m wide river channel. In 2012, hobo pressure type water level gauge was used for water level observation with acquisition frequency of 30 minutes; since 2013, sr50 ultrasonic distance meter was used with acquisition frequency of 30 minutes. On June 25, 2014, the instrument was damaged and re purchased. The record was restarted on May 20, 2015. The data includes the following parts:\nWater level observation, observation frequency 30 minutes, unit (cm);\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Li et al.(2013), and for observation data processing, please refer to He et al.(2016).",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

Understanding the basic characteristics of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert ecosystems is important to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the oasis–desert area and support the ecological security and sustainable development of the oasis. A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
