            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne LiDAR mission and Envisat ASAR was obtained in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas on Jun. 19, 2008.\n     The Envisat ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 11:17 (Beijing Time). The observation item was soil moisture by TDR ( the probe with a length of 5cm) in the maize plot of Yingke oasis station, the wheat plot and some temporary sample points (details in GPS.txt).",
