            "description": "This data includes the three-dimensional urban morphology parameters of the Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area in three development scenarios: SSP1, SSP2, and SSP5, in 2050. The data format is three sets of 500m grid parameter vector data, each containing average building height (mean_predH), standard deviation of building height (std_redH), area weighted average building height (AreaW_H), and proportion of building floor area (Coverage) The proportion of building surface area (BPR) and frontal index (FAI) are six parameters. This data first constructs an urban growth simulation model based on historical land use and multiple sets of spatial variable data. Based on SSP population prediction data, it simulates the new urban land under three SSP scenarios in the Bay Area by 2050; Secondly, the newly added urban patches will be cyclically divided into independent plots, and the constructed building height prediction model will be used to generate building objects in the simulated plots; Finally, based on building information, calculate the parameters of the three-dimensional urban form grid and obtain the simulation results of the evolution of building form scenarios. The overall accuracy of the urban growth simulation model used in this data is 83.4%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.67. The RMSE of the building height prediction model is 2.67m. The results of this data can be used to quantitatively describe the three-dimensional morphology of cities, and can be used as input for regional climate models as urban canopy data, in order to further explore the interaction between urban morphology and climate environment.",

This model simulates new urban land use for the year 2050 under different SSP scenarios, incorporating population prediction data. The simulation then segments new urban patches into independent parcels, where a building height prediction model is used to generate building objects. The resulting 3D urban morphology is quantified using parameters such as mean building height, building height standard deviation, area-weighted average building height, building coverage ratio, building surface ratio, and frontal area index. This method achieves an overall accuracy of 83.4% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.67, with an RMSE of 2.67m for building height predictions.",
