                    "Answer": "The 'cloud elimination process' refers to a series of steps and methods used to remove the influence of clouds in daily snow cover monitoring data, ensuring accurate snow classification. This process is crucial in optical remote sensing, particularly in regions like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where clouds can obscure snow cover. The approach combines multiple de-clouding techniques to maintain high classification accuracy of snow cover in daily satellite imagery, resulting in a dataset that effectively represents cloud-free snow cover areas.",

                    "Question": "What factors contribute to the necessity of implementing cloud removal processes in the creation of snow cover datasets for the Tibetan Plateau?",
                    "Answer": "The necessity of implementing cloud removal processes in the creation of snow cover datasets for the Tibetan Plateau arises from the rapidly changing snow cover in the region and the high prevalence of clouds in optical remote sensing data. The high mountainous areas around the plateau have abundant snow and active atmospheric convection, which frequently result in cloud cover that obscures accurate snow cover detection. To address this, multiple cloud removal processes and steps are employed to maintain snow classification accuracy while eliminating cloud interference in daily snow area measurements.",
