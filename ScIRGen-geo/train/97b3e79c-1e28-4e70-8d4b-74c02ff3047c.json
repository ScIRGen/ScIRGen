            "description": "Paternal genetic structure for the study of the Tibetan people, we collected naqu (n = 233), south (n = 164), a total of 397 male Tibetan individuals.First, by SNP classification method, determines the single times of each sample group of belonging.Second, using an ABI 3130 xl, the 9 STR loci with fluorescent marker testing (including DYS19, DYS388, DYS389, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391 and DYS392 and DYS393), to further study the Y chromosome genetic diversity of the population.The results show that the naqu Tibetan people most D groups (73.82%）, followed by O groups (16.74 %）, and N group (3.86%）. Shannan Tibetan people O groups was highest (46.95%), followed by groups (39.02 %), N groups (7.32%). Other groups, such as R, J, K, etc in the two regions have scattered, this likely reflects the western Eurasia genetic influence on Tibetan people crowd.This data and published from 2019 to 2021 in Lhasa, ali, nagqu, nyingchi Tibetan Y chromosome data integration, to achieve the comparison of different genetic structure of the Tibetan people, and then, through the analysis of the system development as well as the back face history can reveal different Tibetan population groups.",

                    "Answer": "The analysis of Y-chromosome haplogroups in Tibetan populations from different regions can reveal variations in paternal genetic structure, highlighting dominant haplogroups and suggesting historical migration patterns. In the Naqu region, the high frequency of haplogroup D (73.82%) suggests a strong indigenous genetic influence, while the presence of haplogroups O and N might indicate historical interactions or migrations. In contrast, in the Shannan region, haplogroup O is predominant (46.95%), reflecting different paternal lineage influences compared to Naqu. The presence of rarer haplogroups like R, J, and K in both areas hints at sporadic genetic contributions from Western Eurasian populations, possibly due to historical trade or migration routes. These insights can contribute to understanding the demographic history and genetic diversity of Tibetan populations.",

                    "Answer": "The genetic diversity observed in the Y chromosome of Tibetan populations from different regions such as Naqu and Shannan could be influenced by historical migration patterns, genetic drift, and the admixture with neighboring populations. The observed frequency variations, with the D haplogroup being predominant in Naqu and the O haplogroup in Shannan, suggest different ancestral contributions and potential historical events that have shaped the paternal genetic structure. Additionally, the sporadic presence of haplogroups like R, J, and K might reflect historical interactions with populations from western Eurasia. These influences can be further explored through phylogenetic and ancestry tracing analyses.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating Y-chromosome SNP and STR typing data from diverse Tibetan populations allows for a comprehensive comparison of genetic structures across different Tibetan groups. This can reveal variations in paternal lineage frequencies, such as the predominance of the D haplogroup in certain regions and the O haplogroup in others. It also enables phylogenetic and ancestral tracing analyses, which can uncover insights into the historical migration and genetic influences of Eurasian populations on Tibetans.",

This research aims to compare the genetic structures of different Tibetan populations and reveal their population history through phylogenetic and ancestral analysis.",
