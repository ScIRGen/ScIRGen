            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with the airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) mission was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jul. 4, 2008. Simultaneous ground observations on the land surface radiative temperature, the soil temperature and soil moisture were carried out along sampling stripes of newL1-newL12 (each has five points). At each point, soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the canopy temperature and the land surface temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer were measured. \n    See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",

At each sampling point within these strips, soil samples are collected using a ring knife for drying to determine weight water content, volumetric water content, and soil bulk density. A needle thermometer is used to measure the average soil temperature at 0-5 cm depth, and a handheld infrared thermometer is used to measure canopy and surface temperatures.",
