The maximum value composition (MVC) method is used to synthesize the monthly NDVI products on the earth's surface and calculate NPP by using the reflectance data of Landsat 8 and sentinel 2 red and near infrared channels. The data is monthly synthesized by Google Earth engine cloud platform, and the index is calculated by the model. The missing pixels are interpolated with good quality, which can be used in environmental change monitoring and other fields.",
