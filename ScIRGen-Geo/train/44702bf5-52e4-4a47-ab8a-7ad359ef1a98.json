      "description": "This data includes the daily average water temperature data at different depths of Nam Co Lake in Tibet which is obtained through field monitoring. The data is continuously recorded by deploying the water quality multi-parameter sonde and temperature thermistors in the water with the resolution of 10 minutes and 2 hours, respectively, and the daily average water temperature is calculated based on the original observed data. The instruments and methods used are very mature and data processing is strictly controlled to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the data; the data has been used in the basic research of physical limnology such as the study of water thermal stratification, the study of  lake-air heat balance, etc., and to validate the lake water temperature data derived from remote sensing and different lake models studies. The data can be used in physical limnology, hydrology, lake-air interaction, remote sensing data assimilation verification and lake model research.",

        "The seasonal cycle of thermal stratification in large, deep freshwater lakes is modified by latitude and altitude (MacIntyre and Melack, 2009). In general, annual average air temperature decreases with both increasing latitude and altitude, thus the effect of increasing altitude on lake stratification is typically assumed to be equivalent to increasing latitude (e.g., Hutchison and Löffler, 1956; Lewis, 1983). While this generalized latitude/altitude equivalency captures variation in bulk heat input, it neglects changes to the components of surface heat flux with changing latitude. Nam Co is a dimictic, endorheic lake at high altitude (4730 m a.s.l.) located in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau. The Tibetan Plateau is a large, distinct, and relatively understudied geographic region. Its high mean elevation (~4000 m a.s.l.) results in low air temperature despite its relatively low latitude (Qiu, 2008). More than 1123 lakes larger than 1 km2, with a combined surface area of 4×10 4 km2, are distributed across the Tibetan Plateau (Zhang et al., 2013), making it a globally significant lake region."

Meteorological data (air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, short- and long-wave radiation) were recorded at 10-minute intervals at the Nam Co station with a Vaisala MIRO520 automated weather station. Regular water quality profiling of in situ temperature, specific conductivity and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was conducted with a multi-parameter sonde (Hach Hydrolab DS5, USA) at one station in the main western basin (T2, ~93 m depth) every two to four weeks from early April to late November, covering most of the open water period."
