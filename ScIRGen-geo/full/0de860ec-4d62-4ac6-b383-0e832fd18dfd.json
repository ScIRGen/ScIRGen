Most of the greenhouses in Lhasa are regular rectangles with high reflectivity, which is easy to identify. In the process of interpretation, the open fields with an area of more than 0.10 hectares and roads with a width of more than 7 meters in the greenhouse area of protected agriculture, as well as the greenhouse covered with black textile were removed, while the small empty fields and ridges between the farmland of protected agriculture were not removed. The accuracy of interpretation is 98%. The data well reflects the spatial pattern characteristics of greenhouse land in Lhasa city.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of data collection methods for agricultural datasets, '目视解译' refers to the process of visually interpreting imagery to identify and classify features. It involves manually examining high-resolution images, such as those from Google Earth, to discern specific patterns or structures, like greenhouses, based on their shape and reflectivity. This method allows for distinguishing different land uses and is particularly effective for identifying regular geometric forms with high reflectivity, such as greenhouses.",
