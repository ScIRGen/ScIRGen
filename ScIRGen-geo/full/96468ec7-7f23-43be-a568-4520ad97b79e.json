            "description": "Effective evaluation of future climate change, especially prediction of future precipitation, is an important basis for formulating adaptation strategies. This data is based on the RegCM4.6 model, which is compatible with  multi-model and  different carbon emission scenarios: CanEMS2 (RCP 45 and RCP85), GFDL-ESM2M (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), HadGEM2-ES (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 And RCP8.5), IPSL-CM5A-LR (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), MIROC5 (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). The future climate data (2007-2099) has 21 sets, with a spatial resolution at 0.25 degrees and the temporal resolution at 3 hours (or 6 hours), daily and yearly scales.",

                    "Answer": "The regional dynamical downscaling techniques applied to create future climate datasets for China utilize the RegCM4.6 model across multiple carbon emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). These techniques provide a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees and temporal resolutions of 3 hours (with some at 6 hours), daily, and annually, offering high-resolution climate data from 2007 to 2099. The use of multiple models like CanEMS2, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M across various scenarios ensures a comprehensive approach for evaluating future climate changes, particularly precipitation forecasts. The differences in accuracy and resolution may arise from variations in the models' ability to handle specific scenarios, affecting the precision of predictions necessary for strategic adaptation planning.",
