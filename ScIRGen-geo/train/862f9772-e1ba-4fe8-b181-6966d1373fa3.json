            "description": "The Qinghai Tibet Plateau is the highest and most widely distributed plateau in the world. Its main body only uplifted to the current plateau in the Cenozoic era, accompanied by large-scale crustal shortening. However, there is significant controversy in the field of plateau lithosphere deformation time and volume. Based on this, on the one hand, detailed zircon U-Pb dating was conducted on the Eocene Meisu Formation volcanic rocks in Nanqiangtang, and on the other hand, systematic demagnetization research was conducted on the volcanic rocks. Use thermal demagnetization method to systematically demagnetize the volcanic rocks of the Meisu Formation. By analyzing the magnetic components using principal component analysis or large circular arc method, stable high-temperature components were revealed. 181 samples from 28 sampling points had effective high-temperature components, and primary residual magnetism was indicated through fold and inversion tests. Based on the zircon U-Pb dating results, it is found that the southern edge of the South Qiangtang is located at~29.5 ± 5.9 ◦ N at~40 Ma. This result can be used to analyze the shortening of the Cenozoic deformation process in the plateau lithosphere.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of volcanic rock studies, 'systematic demagnetization' refers to the methodical process of removing magnetic signals from rock samples to isolate stable magnetic components. This is typically done using thermal demagnetization techniques, which involve gradually heating the samples to remove secondary magnetization. The goal is to identify the primary remanent magnetization that reflects the Earth's magnetic field at the time the rocks were formed. This process can help reveal the paleoposition of geological formations, such as indicating the position of the southern margin of the Nian Qiangtang during the Eocene at approximately 40 Ma.",
