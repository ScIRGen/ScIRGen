            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Huazhaizi station eddy covariance system (EC) in the midstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2018. The site (100.3201° E, 38.7659° N) was located in the Zhangye City in Gansu Province. The elevation is 1731 m. The EC was installed at a height of 4.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500A) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. Data during May 13 to July 12 and July 16 to August 21, 2018 were missing due to the malfunction of CO2/H2O gas analyzer.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "Eddypro software is used to process raw observational data collected by eddy covariance instruments, transforming 10Hz data into 30-minute averaged data. This processing includes steps like outlier removal, time lag correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic virtual temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. It also involves quality evaluation of flux values based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "Data quality issues can arise due to several factors such as instrument errors, environmental conditions, and data processing methods. For example, errors may occur if the sensors, like the CO2/H2O infrared gas analyzer, malfunction, as seen between May 13th to July 12th and July 16th to August 21st, leading to missing latent heat and CO2 flux data. Additionally, measurement errors can be introduced by factors such as delay time, coordinate rotation inaccuracies, and the need for corrections like frequency response and density (WPL) adjustments. Quality assessments also account for atmospheric conditions like stability and turbulence similarity characteristics, impacting data reliability.",

                    "Answer": "Using Eddypro software for processing flux data involves several steps such as outlier removal, delay time correction, and coordinate rotation, which can enhance the accuracy and reliability of the processed data. These steps correct for measurement biases and ensure that the flux calculations are representative of the actual environmental conditions. Additionally, the software applies quality assessment to flux values, categorizing them by data quality, which helps in identifying and using only reliable data for further analysis. However, reliance on this software may also introduce systematic biases if the processing steps are not properly configured or if the software fails to account for specific site conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve using Eddypro software to process the 10Hz raw data into 30-minute interval data. Key steps include outlier removal, time delay correction, double coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. Additionally, the data undergo quality evaluation based on atmospheric stationarity and turbulence similarity tests. Data filtering is also performed to exclude erroneous instrument data, data from before and after precipitation events, and data with more than 10% missing values in the 10Hz raw data. Missing data is marked as -6999, and specific periods with instrument issues are noted for data gaps.",

Key processing steps include outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic temperature correction, and density correction. Quality assessment involves evaluating atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics, and filtering out data with instrument errors, data around precipitation events, or missing data exceeding a 10% threshold.",
