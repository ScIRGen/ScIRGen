            "description": "We propose an algorithm for ice fissure identification and detection using u-net network, which can realize the automatic detection of ice fissures of Typical Glaciers in Greenland ice sheet. Based on the data of sentinel-1 IW from July  and August every year, in order to suppress the speckle noise of SAR image, the probabilistic patch based weights (ppb) algorithm is selected for filtering, and then the representative samples are selected and input into the u-net network for model training, and the ice cracks are predicted according to the trained model. Taking two typical glaciers in Greenland (Jakobshavn and Kangerdlussuaq) as examples, the average accuracy of classification results can reach 94.5%, of which the local accuracy of fissure area can reach 78.6%, and the recall rate is 89.4%.",

                "Crevasses have developed on almost all glaciers and ice shelves and are the direct result of glacier movement, reflecting the characteristics of glacier development and stresses. The crevasses contribute to the glacier mass balance through impacting the processes of meltwater transportation on the ice surface. Additionally, when sufficient surface meltwater infuses into crevasses, hydrofracturing may be induced, resulting in ice shelf instability; thus, crevasses are essential factors for assessing the stability of glaciers and ice shelves. Antarctic scientific research expeditions are also closely associated with crevasses because the rapid appearance of crevasses may herald the disintegration of the ice shelf and pose a serious safety hazard to field researchers. The orientation and distribution of crevasses can be used to distinguish the ice flow regimes and provide qualitative insight into trends in ice flow. Therefore, crevasses are critical not only for investigating the ice shelves’ stability as well as glacier dynamics but also for providing important safety guidance for glaciological field campaigns."

In the future, more Sentinel-1 SAR imagery will be applied and the effect of temporal and spatial variations in crevasses on the stability of ice shelves will be investigated, which will contribute to project the ice shelf stability and explore the sea level rise implications of recent and future cryosphere changes."

The Thwaites Glacier and the Nickerson Ice Shelf in the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) had shorter ice crevasses, whereas the lengths of ice crevasses on the Jelbart Ice Shelf and the Amery Ice Shelf in the East Antarctica Ice Sheet (EAIS) were relatively long.

For the distribution of crevasse types, the Nickerson Ice Shelf and the Shackleton Ice Shelf had various forms of crevasses.
