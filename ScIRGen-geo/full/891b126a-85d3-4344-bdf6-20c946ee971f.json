This dataset provides the monthly normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) of UAV remote sensing with a spatial resolution of 0.2 m from June to October in 2020. It was measured in the midstream of Heihe River Basin over typical stations. The Pix4D mapper software was used for image mosaic and NDVI calculation.",
