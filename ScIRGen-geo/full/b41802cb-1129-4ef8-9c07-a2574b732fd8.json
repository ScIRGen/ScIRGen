            "description": "This dataset contains the glacier outlines in Qilian Mountain Area in 2015. The dataset was produced based on classical band ratio criterion and manual editing. Chinese GF series images collected in 2018 were used as basic data for glacier extraction. Google images and Map World images were employed as reference data for manual adjusting. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates, glacier ID and glacier area. Consisting of 1 season, the dataset has a spatial resolution of 2 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±2 meter). The dataset directly reflects the glacier distribution within the Qilian Mountain in 2018, and can be used for quantitative estimation of glacier mass balance and the quantitative assessment of glacier change’s impact on basin runoff.",

This method helps distinguish glaciers from other land cover types based on their unique spectral characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "The classical band ratio method is an automated process that involves using spectral information to delineate glacier boundaries, which is efficient for processing large datasets. However, it may require manual corrections to address inaccuracies caused by factors like shadowing or mixed pixels. Manual correction techniques, while more labor-intensive, can improve the accuracy of the extracted boundaries by refining these initial results, ensuring the boundaries align more closely with the actual glacier extents as seen in high-resolution imagery from sources like Google Earth and TianDiTu.",

This approach allows for a spatial resolution of 2 meters and boundary precision of about 2 meters, which can significantly enhance the quality of data used in quantitative estimations of glacier mass balance changes and their impact on watershed runoff.",
