Improvement of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management is now urgently required. This article describes major scientific and technological progress in the field of drought disaster risk assessment. Drought is a worldwide natural disaster that has long affected agricultural production as well as social and economic activities. Frequent droughts have been observed in the Belt and Road area, in which much of the agricultural land is concentrated in fragile ecological environment. Soil relative humidity index is one of the indicators to characterize soil drought and can directly reflect the status of crops' available water.",

                    "Answer": "Remote sensing satellite data is utilized to monitor drought levels and their spatiotemporal changes by capturing large-scale environmental data. This data helps in identifying drought patterns and the variability over time, particularly in areas like the 'Belt and Road' region where ecological vulnerability and frequent droughts occur.",

                    "Answer": "Soil relative humidity indices are indicators of soil drought, directly reflecting the moisture levels accessible to crops. This measurement is crucial for understanding the water availability for agriculture, especially in regions prone to drought, as it provides insights into potential impacts on crop yields.",

                    "Answer": "Assessing drought disaster risks and emergency management requires improved technological methods due to the increasing frequency and intensity of droughts under global warming. Enhanced methods are essential for effectively managing water scarcity, food crises, and ecological degradation, which directly threaten food security and socio-economic development.",
