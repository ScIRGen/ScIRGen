            "description": "The data set is China's multi scenario and multi-mode monthly precipitation data, with a spatial resolution of 0.0083333 ° (about 1km) from January 2021 to December 2100. The data is in NetCDF format. The data is generated in China through the delta spatial downscaling scheme according to the global > 100 km climate model data set released in the sixth phase of the IPCC coupled model comparison program (cmip6) and the global high-resolution climate data set released by worldclim. The data adopts the latest SSP scenarios (ssp119, ssp245, ssp585) released by IPCC. Each scenario contains the climate data of three GCMS (ec-earth3, gfdl-esm4, mri-esm2-0). The geospatial range contained in the dataset is China's main land, excluding islands and reefs in the South China Sea. The unit is 0.1mm. The file name is GCM_ SSP_ Pre-30s-serial number NC, 30s, i.e. 0.0083333 °, serial number from 1-40, serial number 1 represents 2021.1-2022.12, and represents the year in turn; Based on ec-earth3_ ssp119_ pre-30s-1. NC file, for example, represents the monthly precipitation data of ec-earth3 climate model with 1km resolution from 2021.1 to 2022.12 under ssp119 scenario. For a deeper understanding of the data, please refer to the data cited in the literature and the published papers of the authors.",

                    "Answer": "The 'Delta spatial downscaling method' refers to a technique used to increase the spatial resolution of climate datasets. In the context of climate data processing, it involves using higher-resolution data, such as from WorldClim, to adjust coarser resolution global climate model (GCM) outputs, like those from CMIP6, to generate more detailed datasets. This method helps create finer spatial resolution data, such as 1km, which is crucial for regional applications like those in China, while maintaining the large-scale patterns and trends from the original GCM data.",

                    "Answer": "The need for downscaling global climate model data to create high-resolution regional precipitation datasets for China arises from the original global climate models having a coarse spatial resolution (>100 km), which is insufficient for regional studies. To address this, a Delta spatial downscaling method is used to generate data with a finer resolution of approximately 1 km, making it more suitable for regional climate assessment and planning in China.",

This approach is applied to downscale the >100 km resolution global climate model data to a 1 km resolution for China. The process involves selecting appropriate scenarios (SSP119, SSP245, SSP585) and climate models (EC-Earth3, GFDL-ESM4, MRI-ESM2-0) to ensure the downscaled data captures regional climate variations accurately. The data is then structured in NETCDF format, with a spatial resolution of 0.0083333° and organized in monthly increments from 2021 to 2100.",
