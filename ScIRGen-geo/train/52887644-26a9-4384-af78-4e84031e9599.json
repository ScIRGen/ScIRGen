            "description": "The table includes the data of laser ablation plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) of pyrite and chalcopyrite from Jingchong co Cu polymetallic deposit in Hunan Province. The experimental method was la-icp-ms. The analysis was completed in the National Geological Experiment and testing center. The analytical instrument was Finnigan element 2 ICP-MS with nwr193 nm laser ablation system. In the experiment, helium was used as carrier gas, and the diameter of laser spot was 35 μ m. The pulse frequency is 10 Hz, the laser energy is 80%, the analysis time of each point is 60 s, including 20 s background test and 40 s sample signal. The tested elements include 34S, 57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni, 65Cu, 66zn, 75as, 82se, 96Mo, 107ag, 115In, 118sn, 121Sb, 208Pb, 209bi, etc. The USGS sulfide standards mass1, nist610 and nist612 were used as the combined external standard, kl2g (one of the silicate standard series mpi-ding) as the monitoring standard, and the Fe content analyzed by EPMA as the internal standard.\nThe above data have been published in EI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored in Excel.",
