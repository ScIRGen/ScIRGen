The source data of this data comes from Myanmar's 2019 1km population data set in the world pop data center（ https://www.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=40443 ）, the obtained source data are processed by projection transformation and clipping to obtain the population distribution in Yangon, and then the data are downscaled, The spatial distribution data set of refined population (10m) in Yangon deep water port area is obtained. Regular ten meter scale population grid data are obtained by spatial scale conversion and downscaling. Each grid population is calculated by random forest method according to the population of each administrative unit and multi-source auxiliary data. Population data can be used in many fields, including urban planning, elections, risk assessment, disaster relief, disease prevention and control, poverty reduction and poverty alleviation, etc;",
