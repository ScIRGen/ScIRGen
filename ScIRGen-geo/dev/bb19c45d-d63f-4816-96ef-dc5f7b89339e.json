            "description": "This dataset provides the magnetic susceptibility and IRM data of loess dust in the West Kunlun Mountains since 3.6 Ma. The experimental samples were obtained from a 671-m-deep loess core in the highest fan surface of the southern margin of the Tarim Basin. Block samples were taken at intervals of 20-40 centimeters in thickness, i.e. 1-3 thousand years. The magnetic susceptibility and IRM measurements were conducted at the Paleomagnetic Laboratory of the Key Laboratory of Continental Collision and Plateau Uplift, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The magnetic susceptibility was tested using Bartingdon MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter at 470 and 4700Hz. The IRM was imparted in a 1 T field using an ASC Pulse Magnetizer, and then measured using a Molspin Minispin magnetometer.  The magnetic susceptibility typically reflects variations in the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals (maghemite/magnetite) in samples. IRM reflects the concentration of remanence-bearing material (typically ferrimagnetic maghemite/magnetite and imperfect antiferromagnetic hematite/goethite) to samples. This data provides the environmental magnetic parameter changes of the  loess dust in the West Kunlun Mountains since 3.6 Ma., and  thus presenting important evidence for exploring the physical properties variations of loess dust in the arid regions of Central Asia and identifying dust transport to potential dust affected areas.",

                    "Answer": "The dataset involves measuring magnetic susceptibility using a Bartington MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter at 470 and 4700 Hz, and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization using an ASC pulse magnetometer with a 1T magnetic field, followed by testing with a Molspin mini-spin magnetometer. These methods reflect variations in the content of ferromagnetic minerals like magnetite and hematite. This approach, specifically tailored for the loess deposits in the Kunlun Mountains, contrasts with other geological settings where different instruments and frequencies might be used based on the mineral composition and grain size of the samples. The choice of instrumentation and measurement frequency in this dataset is likely optimized for detecting the magnetic properties relevant to the arid Central Asian loess context.",
