            "description": "As the roof of the world, the water tower of Asia and the third pole of the world, the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is an important ecological security barrier for China and even Asia. With the rapid development of social economy, human activities have increased significantly, and the impact on the ecological environment is growing. In this paper, eight factors including cultivated land, construction land, National Road, provincial road, railway, expressway, GDP and population density were selected as the threat factors, and the attributes of the threat factors were determined based on the expert scoring method to evaluate the habitat quality of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, so as to obtain six data sets of the habitat quality of the agricultural and pastoral areas of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. The production of habitat quality data sets will help to explore the habitat quality of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and provide effective support for the government to formulate sustainable development policies of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

These factors can help identify specific human activities that may affect the ecosystem, leading to more accurate evaluations of habitat quality. However, this complexity also introduces challenges in balancing and weighing each factor's influence, which requires careful methodological consideration and expert input to ensure the assessment reflects the real-world dynamics accurately.",

These factors are used as threat indicators. Expert scoring methods are then applied to determine the attributes of these threat factors. This approach allows for the assessment of habitat quality over different time periods, providing data for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Such a dataset can support the exploration of habitat quality in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and provide valuable insights for sustainable development policy-making.",
