            "description": "The source of the data is paper: Zhang, J.F., Xu, B.Q., Turner, F., Zhou, L.P., Gao, P., Lü, X.M., & Nesje, A. (2017). Long-term glacier melt fluctuations over the past 2500 yr in monsoonal high asia revealed by radiocarbon-dated lacustrine pollen concentrates. Geology, 45(4), 359-362.\nIn this paper, the researcher of Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences and CAS Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Baiqing Xu, with his postdoctoral fellow, Jifeng Zhang, and collaborators from Peking University and other institutions, propose that the OPE (“old pollen effect”, the offset between the calibrated 14C ages of pollen in lake sediments and the sediment depositional age) as a new indicator of glacier melt intensity and fluctuations by measuring the radiocarbon ages of the sediments of the proglacial lake of Qiangyong Glacier on the southern Tibetan Plateau with multi-methods (bulk organic matter, pollen concentrates and plant residues). This research suggests that hemispheric-scale temperature variations and mid-latitude Westerlies may be the main controllers of the late Holocene glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia. It also shows that the 20th-century glacier melt intensity exceeded that of two historical warm epochs (the Medieval Warm Period, and the Iron/Roman Age Optimum) and is unprecedented at least for the past 2.5 k.y.\nThis data is provided by the author of the paper, it contains long-term glacier melt fluctuations of Qiangyong Glacier over the past 2500 yr reconstructed by the OPE.\nA 3.06-m-long core (QYL09-4) and a 1.06-m-long parallel gravity core (QY-3) were retrieved by the researchers from the depositional center of Qiangyong Co. Using a new composite extraction procedure, they obtained relatively pure pollen concentrates and plant residue concentrates (PRC; >125 μm) from the finely laminated sediments. Bulk organic matter and the PRC and pollen fractions were used for 14C dating independently. All 14C ages were calibrated with IntCal13 (Reimer et al., 2013). The age-depth model is based on 210Pb and 137Cs ages and five 14C ages of PRC. Only the youngest PRC ages were used for the age-depth model, whereas older ages that produce a stratigraphic reversal and are apparently influenced by redeposited or aquatic plant material were rejected. The deposition model was constructed using the P_Sequence algorithm in Oxcal 4.2 (Bronk Ramsey, 2008). For the calculation of the offset between the calibrated pollen 14C ages and the sediment depositional age, 2σ intervals for interpolated ages according to the deposition model were subtracted from calibrated pollen ages (2σ span), resulting in the age offset between pollen and estimated sediment ages (ΔAgepollen).\nThis data is radiocarbon ages and the calculated ΔAgepollen of core QYL09-4 from a proglacial lake of Qiangyong Glacier.\nThe data contains fields as follows:\t\t\t\t\nLab No.\nDating Material\nDepth (cm)\n14C age (yr BP)\n∆Agepollen (≥95.4 % yrs)\nSediment Age (CE)\nSee attachments for data details: ZhangJF et al. 2017 GEOLOGY_Long-term glacier melt fluctuations over the past 2500 yr on the Tibetan Plateau.pdf.",

                "Long-term records of glacier mass changes are important for improving our understanding of glacier dynamics and for predicting the response of glaciers to future climate change. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surroundings contain the largest number of glaciers outside the polar regions and have shown spatially heterogeneous glacier responses to global warming. Moraine sequences directly record ice margin change, but they are discrete low-resolution series and can be easily eroded by subsequent glacial advances of a larger extent. Multi-proxies (e.g., organic matter content, elements, and grain size) from proglacial lake sediments have been used to reconstruct continuous records of glacier change, but nonglacial processes (e.g., rainfall events, colluvial activity, and debris flows) can confound the extraction of glacial signals. Pollen preserved in Tibetan ice cores has been used to reconstruct past climate change, but no studies have focused on the effects of the melt of old ice in terms of the release of old pollen. According to a conceptual model of glacier flow, young ice containing modern pollen is formed in the accumulation area and then flows slowly to the ablation area and becomes a reservoir of old pollen. Intensified glacier melt releases more old pollen from the old ice, which, together with overridden soil from beneath the glacier, enters proglacial lakes and results in a larger offset between the calibrated 14C ages of pollen in lake sediments and the sediment depositional age."

Sediments from lake Qiangyong Co, China, were used to test our hypothesis through comparisons of the OPE against regional moraine ages. A 2.5 k.y. record of glacier variability is presented and is compared with other paleoclimatic and paleoglacial records in order to infer spatial correlations and dynamics of late Holocene glacier change in monsoonal High Asia."

Moraine sequences directly record ice margin changes, but they can be affected by subsequent glacial advances. In contrast, the pollen concentrate method provides a new indicator, the 'old pollen effect,' to assess glacier melt intensity, offering a more continuous and detailed insight into glacier dynamics.",

Pollen concentrates, on the other hand, specifically utilize the 'old pollen effect' as a novel indicator of glacier melt intensity, focusing on the offset between pollen and sediment deposition ages to reveal fluctuations. This method addresses some of the confounding factors associated with multi-proxies by isolating the glacier melt signal more effectively.",

An age-depth model was constructed based on 210Pb and 137Cs ages and calibrated 14C ages, using the P_Sequence algorithm in Oxcal 4.2. This approach allowed for the accurate reconstruction of glacier variability by comparing the 'old pollen effect' against regional moraine ages.",

These challenges can be addressed by isolating and analyzing specific proxies that are less likely to be influenced by non-glacial processes, such as pollen concentrates, and by using robust statistical models to differentiate between glacial and non-glacial signals in the sediment records.",

                    "Answer": "The 'old pollen effect' is considered a reliable indicator of glacier melt intensity because intensified glacier melt releases more old pollen from the old ice. This pollen, along with overridden soil from beneath the glacier, enters proglacial lakes, creating a larger offset between the calibrated 14C ages of pollen in lake sediments and the sediment depositional age. This offset helps researchers infer historical glacier fluctuations.",
