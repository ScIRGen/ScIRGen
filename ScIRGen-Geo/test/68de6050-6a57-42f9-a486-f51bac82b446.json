There are four recorded stations near Dhaka city. The monitoring data of meteorological stations have the characteristics of high precision. Firstly, the monitoring data of stations in the world are downloaded from NCEI, and then four stations in Dhaka city are selected according to longitude and latitude. The data level records the daily meteorological station monitoring data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019.",

        "The performance of general circulation models (GCMs) at the local scale is often poor, which is particularly true for surface variables (Giorgi et al. 2001). The local-scale surface variables are, however, essential for assessing climate change impacts. On the other hand, GCM simulations of large-scale upper-air fields are generally considered quite reliable. The methodologies to bridge the gap between what is successfully simulated by GCMs and what is needed in climate impact research are generally referred to as downscaling."

Its aims can be summarized in a few items: (i) to compare the performance of several linear downscaling methods and several sets of large-scale predictors in terms of the accuracy of specification, temporal structure, and spatial structure; (ii) to compare the performance of the two ways of reproduction of variance (inflation vs randomization); and (iii) to estimate the dependence of the downscaling output on the size of the domains on which the predictors and predictands are defined."

Daily mean temperature data are collected at 39 stations in central and parts of western Europe (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, and Switzerland). Three linear methods of statistical downscaling are evaluated in this study: (i) CCA prefiltered by principal component analysis (PCA), (ii) singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, and (iii) MLR."

The best choice of predictors appears to be a pair of one circulation and one temperature predictor. Of the two ways of reproducing the original variance, inflation yields more realistic both temporal and spatial variability than randomization. The size of the domain on which predictors are defined plays a rather negligible role."
