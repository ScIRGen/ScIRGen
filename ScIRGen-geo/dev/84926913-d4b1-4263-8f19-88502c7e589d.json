            "description": "The data is based on the published archaeological materials in Gansu and Qinghai areas, and the excavation reports of 21 sites in 7 Cultural sequences in the study area, including 12 sites in Gansu and 9 sites in Qinghai. By using the method of mathematical statistics, this paper sorts out the quantity, height and combination of the pot, bowl, basin, pot, Zun, Weng, Dou, bowl, plate, cup, pan, bottle, jar and steamer of the Neolithic Bronze Age in Gansu Qinghai area. In view of the fact that there are many kinds of cultural relics in some sites, this paper uses the method of repeated statistics of cultural periods to determine the data of a certain cultural type. By using the method of mathematical statistical analysis, this paper makes a statistical analysis of the collected data, and analyzes and interprets the relationship between the data by drawing the change trend chart; In addition, this paper calculates and summarizes the quantity proportion and combination of a certain utensil in its cultural sequence, so as to ensure the cross validation among the three, further reveal its changing characteristics and reveal its changing rules. This paper mainly discusses the evolution of the four types of commonly used pottery, and analyzes the factors that may affect the evolution of pottery in combination with the paleoclimate records and archaeological data in Gansu Qinghai region and its surrounding areas.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format and contains three worksheets: height pottery, size data of pottery in Gansu Qinghai region, type and quantity of pottery in Gansu Qinghai region. Among them, there are pots, bowls, pots, pot Zun, wengdou, bowls, plates, cups and oysters of different cultural types in the height pottery worksheet. There are 11 tables in the table of pottery size data in Gansu Qinghai region, which are preliminary data 1, Yangshao period, Majiayao period, Qijia period, Kayue period, Xindian period, Siwa period, Siba period, preliminary data 2, average value calculation and standard square medium variation. The cultural relics of each cultural type are recorded respectively. There are eight tables in the table of types and quantities of artifacts in Ganqing area, including the quantity, cultural attribute, site, types, proportion, quantity and combination of artifacts in Yangshao, Majiayao, Qijia, kayuo, Xindian, Siwa and Siba periods.

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for analyzing pottery evolution in the Gan-Qing region involve statistical analysis based on published archaeological materials from 21 sites across seven cultural sequences. This method includes repetitive statistical accounting for sites with multiple cultural remains to determine specific cultural type data. It uses mathematical statistical analysis to process the gathered data, ensuring cross-verification of findings through calculations of quantity ratios and combinations, and displays results via trend graphs. This approach may differ from other archaeological data collection techniques that might focus more on qualitative analysis or use different statistical models without the same level of emphasis on cross-verification and trend visualization.",

This suggests that cultural influences and environmental factors, such as ancient climate conditions and archaeological contexts, may play significant roles in the evolution of pottery forms and functions. By examining these patterns, researchers can infer how cultural shifts and environmental changes potentially impacted pottery design and usage over different periods.",
