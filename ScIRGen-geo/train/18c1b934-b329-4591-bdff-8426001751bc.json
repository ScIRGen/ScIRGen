            "description": "Industrial transformation refers to the state or process of significant changes in industrial structure, industrial scale, industrial organization, industrial technology and equipment in the main composition of a country or region's national economy. From this point of view, industrial transformation is a comprehensive process, including industrial transformation in structure, organization and technology. Another explanation refers to the reallocation of resource stock among industries in an industry, that is, the process of transferring capital, labor and other production factors from declining industries to emerging industries\nData include industrial output impact data of water resources industrial structure adjustment (primary industry technology, secondary industry technology, tertiary industry technology)",
