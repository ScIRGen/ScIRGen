            "description": "In April 2014 and may 2016, 21 Lakes (7 non thermal lakes and 14 thermal lakes) were collected in the source area of the Yellow River (along the Yellow River) respectively. The abundance of hydrogen and oxygen allogens was measured by Delta V advantage dual inlet / hdevice system in inno tech Alberta laboratory in Victoria, Canada. The isotope abundance was expressed in the form of δ (‰) (relative to the average seawater abundance in Vienna) ）Test error: δ 18O: 0.1 ‰, δ D: 1 ‰. The data also includes Lake area and lake basin area extracted from Landsat 2017 image data in Google Earth engine.",

                    "Answer": "In hydrological studies, 'isotope abundance expressed as δ (‰) relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water' refers to the measurement of the ratios of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water samples compared to a standard known as Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). This expression helps in understanding variations in water sources and processes such as evaporation and precipitation in hydrological cycles by providing a standardized baseline for comparison.",

                    "Answer": "Isotopic abundance, expressed as δ18O and δD, allows for the differentiation of water sources and can indicate hydrological processes such as evaporation and inflow. By analyzing isotopic data, researchers can infer the balance of water inputs and outputs, and estimate hydrological metrics like the evaporation/inflow ratio (E/I) and watershed yield (WY), providing insights into the lake's water balance and hydrological dynamics.",

                    "Answer": "Using isotopic abundance tests with error margins of δ18O: 0.1‰ and δD: 1‰ can affect the precision of hydrological estimates such as evaporation/inflow ratios (E/I) and watershed water yield (WY). These tests influence the reliability of data by providing a specific range of accuracy, which may lead to variations in the calculated hydrological parameters. The presence of these error margins necessitates the consideration of uncertainty in the model estimates based on isotopic mass balance, potentially affecting decision-making and analysis outcomes in hydrological studies.",
