            "description": "This data is geochemical data of Jurassic volcanic rocks in southern Tibet, including major and trace elements, zircon U-Pb dating, zircon trace elements and apatite major and trace elements. The data are from a large arc related porphyry deposit in Gangdise belt (Xietongmen). The newly published data of Bima formation are compared with the published data of Yeba formation to understand their different relationships with mineralization. The volcanic rocks of Bima formation are composed of basalt, andesite and dacite, all of which contain zircon. The age of single bond Pb is 195.0   ma - 165.1   MA (new age is 180.2   MA) ±  0.8 ~ 166.7  ±  1.1 Ma)。 The geochemical characteristics of basalts, intermediate rocks and felsic rocks are consistent, and the SR nd Hf isotopic characteristics are similar (87Sr / 86Sr) I   =   0.703182 ~ 0.705489); ε Nd (T)   =   3.2 to 7.1; ε HF (T)   =   9.3 ~ 16.0) indicates that it was formed in fractional crystallization of basalt magma. The volcanic rocks of Yeba formation are similar in age range (192.7   Ma ~ 168.0   MA), but have a wide composition range (from basalt to rhyolite). The SR nd Hf isotopic composition ((87Sr / 86Sr) I   =   0.700182 ~ 0.707723; ε Nd (T)   =  − 5.1 to 4.5; ε High frequency (T)   =  − 18.5 to 17.6).\nCompared with Yeba formation, Bima formation andesite and dacite samples have higher zircon EU / EU *, Ce4 + / Ce3 + and (CE / nd) / y ratios, and lower temperature of titanium in zircon, which indicates that Bima formation magma has stronger oxidation and water content, so it is more conducive to the formation of porphyry copper deposits. The Yeba formation magma was relatively reduced and formed in the distal arc environment near the paleobasement in central Lhasa. Their evolutionary isotopic characteristics and reducibility may be due to the contamination of more extensive reductive crustal components, making them unsuitable for porphyry copper mineralization. Therefore, the exploration of arc related porphyry copper deposits in the Gangdise belt should focus on the fertile Bima formation.",

In comparison, the Yeba Group volcanic rocks, while having a similar age range and encompassing a wider compositional range from basalt to rhyolite, show different isotopic compositions suggesting broader crustal contamination. This indicates that while both groups employ similar dating and geochemical analysis methods, the Bima Group's techniques may provide more precise insights into the oxidation state and water content favorable for porphyry copper mineralization, whereas the Yeba Group's data may reflect more varied and complex crustal influences.",

                    "Answer": "The geochemical characteristics and isotopic similarities of the Jurassic volcanic rocks, specifically the basalts, andesites, and dacites of the Bima group, suggest that they are products of fractional crystallization of basaltic magma. Their higher zircon Eu/Eu*, Ce4+/Ce3+, and (Ce/Nd)/Y ratios, along with lower zircon titanium temperatures, indicate a more oxidized and hydrous environment. This suggests that the magmas were more conducive to forming porphyry copper deposits compared to the Yeba group, which formed in a more reduced and distal arc environment with more crustal contamination, making them less favorable for such mineralization.",

                    "Answer": "The geochemical variations in volcanic rocks associated with arc-related porphyry copper deposits in the Tibetan region are influenced by the oxidation state and water content of the magma. For example, the Bima group rocks, which are more favorable for porphyry copper formation, exhibit higher zircon Eu/Eu*, Ce4+/Ce3+, and (Ce/Nd)/Y ratios and lower zircon Ti temperatures, indicating a more oxidized and hydrous magma. In contrast, the Yeba group rocks show signs of reduced magma due to contamination by reduced crustal components, making them less suitable for porphyry copper mineralization.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing varying geochemical compositions and isotopic characteristics from volcanic rock samples can help reveal the oxidation states and water content of magmas, which in turn can indicate the potential for forming porphyry copper deposits. For instance, differences in zircon Eu/Eu*, Ce4+/Ce3+, and (Ce/Nd)/Y ratios, as well as zircon Ti temperatures, can imply a higher oxidation state and water content in magmas, making them more favorable for mineralization. By comparing different groups, such as Bima and Yeba, researchers can identify which magmatic environments are more conducive to mineralization and focus exploration efforts accordingly.",

In this field, it specifically aids in identifying the differences in oxidation states and hydration levels in magmas, which are crucial for the formation of porphyry copper deposits. The goal is to focus exploration efforts on formations like the 比马组, which show characteristics more conducive to copper mineralization compared to others like the 野坝组.",
