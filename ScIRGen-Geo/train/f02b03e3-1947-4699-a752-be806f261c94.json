      "description": "High precision climate prediction data is crucial for addressing research gaps in environmental change, urban planning, and disaster management. This study utilized 18 CMIP6 models and ERA5 datasets that have been corrected for bias, and used the WRF model for dynamic downscaling to develop a new dataset. This dataset has a spatial grid of 9 kilometers and a 15 minute time resolution, covering the future periods of the 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s under SSP245 and SSP585 emission scenarios. It includes temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind direction, and wind speed. Compared to the CMIP6 model before takeoff and landing scales, it performs better in temperature and rainfall validation, with significantly lower deviations than other CMIP6 models. And this dataset integrates global and regional weather models, while other models often cannot meet the requirements of urban hydrological processes such as flooding. Its precise spatiotemporal downscaling provides a comprehensive climate prediction tool, supporting adaptive urban design and enhanced resilience. High resolution data has important applications in urban hydrology, agricultural forecasting, urban planning, infrastructure design, and disaster warning systems, especially in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, highlighting its role in scientific decision-making and social adaptation to climate change.",

        "As the Arctic continues to warm faster than the rest of the planet, evidence mounts that the region is experiencing unprecedented environmental change. The hydrological cycle is projected to intensify throughout the twenty-first century, with increased evaporation from expanding open water areas and more precipitation. The latest projections from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) point to more rapid Arctic warming and sea-ice loss by the year 2100 than in previous projections, and consequently, larger and faster changes in the hydrological cycle. Arctic precipitation (rainfall) increases more rapidly in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 due to greater global warming and poleward moisture transport, greater Arctic amplification and sea-ice loss and increased sensitivity of precipitation to Arctic warming. There is general agreement that Arctic precipitation will increase through the twenty-first century, with estimates ranging from 30% to 60% by the year 2100. A wetter Arctic results from increased evaporation as a result of more open water due to sea-ice loss; higher air temperatures, increasing the atmosphere’s ability to carry moisture; and increased poleward moisture transport. The Arctic is also expected to transition from a largely snow-dominated to a rain-dominated precipitation regime, a transition already being observed over the Atlantic sector. Outputs from the new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments provide an opportunity to assess the latest projections of climate change under various emissions forcing scenarios. Relative to CMIP5, CMIP6 has improved simulations of the sea-ice mean state and trends over the period of satellite observations, as well as improved simulations of historical snow cover and global precipitation intensities."

        "The Arctic region is defined here as the area north of 70°N as identified by the black line in Fig.1c–f and statistical analyses were performed for this area only. Only models with simulations for both the historical and SSP/RCP scenarios in both CMIP6 and CMIP5 were included. End-of-century changes (taken as the average of 2091–2100), relative to the start of the century (the 10-year mean of 2005–2014, which for CMIP5 was conducted using the first 10 years of the RCP8.5 scenario), were computed for all analyzed variables. The transition decade was determined as the decade annual and seasonal snowfall-to-total precipitation ratio falls to <<<50% as assessed from binning 10-year windows. The snowfall ratio change over time in ERA5, CMIP6 and CMIP5 was calculated by dividing snowfall by total precipitation and averaged following a 10-year rolling mean. The comparison between 1.5 °C, 2 °C and 3 °C global warming and the snowfall-to-precipitation ratio was based on global temperatures from 1960 to 2100 relative to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) baseline of 1850–1900 and snowfall ratio from 1960 to 2100 for each model individually. This was calculated using output from the RCP8.5 scenario. To calculate change in the snowfall-to-precipitation ratio relative to global temperature anomalies, which has a fairly linear and significant relationship, we regressed the global temperature anomalies against the snowfall-to-precipitation ratio and used the slope and intercept values to calculate what the ratio would be given a 1.5 °C, 2 °C and 3 °C temperature increase."

        "Rainfall is the most critical climate variable among all meteorological variables. The most devastating natural disasters like floods and droughts occur due to excess and deficit of rainfall. Asia-Pacific region experiences more water-related disasters compared to other continents. Recently, significant changes have been observed in rainfall distribution in Asian regions, which caused an increasing severity and frequency of fluvial hazards in Asia. For example, the region experienced 236 severe floods only between 2014 and 2017. Mainland South-East Asia (MSEA) is particularly more susceptible to hydrological hazards. Global climate model (GCM) projections are generally used to analyze climate change. Several GCMs have been developed in the last few decades for climate change projections. The simulations of those GCMs were released under the umbrella of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) in different phases. The CMIP3 consisted of 25 GCMs, CMIP5 had 40 GCMs, whereas the most recent CMIP6 have 55 GCMs. Improved simulations in CMIP6 GCMs are expected after addressing the limitations reported in CMIP5 GCMs, like the existence of bias in seasonal and annual precipitation. Several other improvements in CMIP6 compared to previous CMIPs have also been reported. For example, Eyring et al. (2016) reported better capacity of CMIP6 GMCs in understanding the role of clouds in climate sensitivity, analyze the changes in cryosphere due to climate changes and the climate extremes, and an improvement in near term climate prediction as compared to CMIP5 GCMs. Though the use of many GCMs is often deemed beneficial to manage intermodal uncertainty, high processing cost prevents the practice of the use of a huge amount of data. Therefore, an optimum subset with an acceptable range of uncertainty is preferred to represent the future climate with minimum possible uncertainty. This emphasizes the selection of a suitable subset of GCMs that can replicate the past climate reliably and provide realistic future projections. The most general criteria used for choosing a subset of GCMs is their skill to replicate the observed annual and seasonal climatology."

We, therefore, select the 6-hourly dataset produced by the high-resolution version of the MPI-M earth system model (MPI-M1-2-HR) in CMIP6 to generate weather and interannual variability of the large-scale forcing data. We also used the ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979 to 2014, which is produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ECMWF) using 4D-var data assimilation. Both the ERA5 and CMIP6 data were regridded to a horizontal resolution of 1.25° longitude × 1.25° latitude by bilinear interpolation. The bias corrections are applied to 6-hourly data. The nonlinear trend was calculated with the EEMD method. We assume that the variance bias remains the same from the historical to a future period. Thus, we can correct the variance bias by multiplying the perturbation term by a scaling factor, rs. To reduce the certainty of future projection, we replace the long-term nonlinear trend derived from the single GCM with that derived from MME in Eq. (3). Further bias-corrected data can be constructed as follows: GCM𝑣𝑡𝑡 = MME𝐿𝐿 − �MME𝐿𝐿|𝐻������������ − ERA𝐿𝐿|𝐻������������ + GCM′ × r𝑠 = ERA𝐿𝐿|𝐻����������� + �MME𝐿𝐿 − MME𝐿𝐿|𝐻������������� + GCM′ × r𝑠 (6). The EEMD method used to compute the nonlinear trend is very time-consuming if we apply EEMD to process global 6-hourly 3-D data sets over multiple decades. To save computing time, we assume that the nonlinear trends remain the same for each 6-hourly/daily value of variables within the same month. Before correcting the variance biases, we compute the anomaly of detrended GCM data at each 6-hourly interval/day of the year. The standard deviation of each 6-hour and day of the year is calculated across 36 years from 1979 to 2014. To remove the unrealistic ratios of standard deviation, we first calculate the original standard deviation with all 36 years of data and then recalculate the standard deviation after removing the years with anomalies greater than 3 times the original standard deviation."
