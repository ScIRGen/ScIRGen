The data is from Liu et al. (2015), and the specific calculation method is shown in the article. The source data range is global, and Tibetan Plateau region is selected in this data set. This data set is often used to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of vegetation greenness and primary productivity, which has practical significance and theoretical value.",
