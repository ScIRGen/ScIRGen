The data are aimed to provide service for students and researchers engaged in meteorological research on the Tibetan Plateau. The precipitation data are observed by artificial rainfall barrel, the evaporation data are observed by Φ20 mm evaporating pan, and all the others are daily averages and ten-day means obtained after half hour observational data are processed. All the data are observed and collected in strict accordance with the Equipment Operating Specifications, and some obvious error data are eliminated when processing the generated data.",

The thermal effects of the giant plateau on the atmosphere greatly influence circulations over China, eastern Asia and even the globe. The plateau absorbs a large proportion of solar radiation (some of which is redistributed by cryospheric processes) and undergoes dramatic seasonal changes of surface heat and water fluxes. The lack of quantitative understanding of interactions between the land surface and atmosphere makes it difficult to understand and model the complete energy and water cycles over the Tibetan Plateau and their effects on global climate change. Therefore, the number of atmosphere-land interaction studies over the Tibetan Plateau has been increased in recent years."

The diurnal variations of the turbulent fluxes are different during the dry period (pre-monsoon period) and wet period (inside monsoon period). The diurnal variation of momentum flux over the northern Tibetan Plateau area during the dry period is also obvious, increasing in the morning to its maximum in the afternoon, and then decreasing. Sensible heat flux H and latent heat flux LE vary by less than 10% of their magnitude with height over the flat prairie area of Naqu area of the northern Tibetan Plateau. The land surface is a very strong heating source in the day time, it is a weak surface heating sink in the night, but the daily mean is strong surface heating source. The diurnal variation of CO2 flux in summer is obvious over the alpine meadow surface of Mt. Everest area. The plateau ABL can extend to heights of almost 3 km above the ground surface in Naqu area of the northern Tibetan Plateau, and is characterized by a well-mixed layer of potential temperature. The convection over the Tibetan Plateau evolves from dry shallow convection in the morning to wet deep convection in the afternoon. The vertical gradients of potential temperature and humidity in the ABL of the Tibetan Plateau have an obvious sudden change in the middle of June."

Remote sensing from satellites however offers the possibility to derive regional distribution of surface heat fluxes over heterogeneous land surface of the Tibetan Plateau in combination with sparse field experimental stations.
