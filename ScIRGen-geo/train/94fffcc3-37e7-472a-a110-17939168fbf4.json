            "description": "Frozen soil refers to a soil or rock mass with a temperature lower than or equal to 0 ° C and containing ice. It is particularly sensitive to temperature and its physical and mechanical properties change significantly with temperature. The frost heaving deformation and melt settlement deformation of frozen soil are the most common frozen soil disasters. Their occurrence is mainly caused by the change of the inherent temperature of frozen soil due to the frozen soil engineering activities. Therefore, the protection of frozen soil is mainly to protect the temperature of frozen soil. , to maintain it in the closest state before the engineering activities. The main method for obtaining the temperature of the frozen land is to embed the temperature measuring cable. Through the data acquisition function of the CR3000, the resistance value of the temperature measuring cable is obtained at different times, and the temperature value is calculated by the correspondence between the calibration coefficient and the resistance value. According to the sensitive characteristics of frozen soil to temperature, the change of ground temperature can reflect the change of climate, and can also analyze the influence mechanism and degree of human activities on the stability of frozen soil in combination with other factors, so as to guide the later engineering activities. Upgrading and upgrading of frozen soil protection measures.",

                    "Answer": "The necessity arises from the fact that permafrost, which is soil or rock that remains at or below 0℃ and contains ice, is highly sensitive to temperature changes. These changes can cause significant alterations in its physical and mechanical properties, leading to common permafrost hazards such as frost heave and thaw settlement. Monitoring temperature variations is crucial because the inherent temperature changes in permafrost are often induced by engineering activities, making it important to maintain the original temperature conditions to prevent such hazards. Thus, data collection methods often involve the installation of temperature cables and using data acquisition systems like CR3000 to monitor resistance changes over time, which are then used to calculate temperature values.",

These fluctuations are highly indicative of climate change impacts, as they reflect the sensitivity of permafrost to temperature variations. By analyzing these temperature changes, researchers can infer the mechanisms and extent of human activities affecting permafrost stability. This understanding is crucial for guiding engineering practices aimed at protecting permafrost by maintaining its temperature as close as possible to pre-disturbance levels, thus preventing common permafrost-related hazards like frost heave and thaw settlement.",

This monitoring helps to understand the impact of climate change and human activities on the stability of permafrost.
