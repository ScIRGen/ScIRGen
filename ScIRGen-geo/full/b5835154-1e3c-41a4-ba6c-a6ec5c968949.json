Soil pH value: longitude, latitude and pH value of typical soil sample points.\n2. Soil texture: including soil texture data of typical soil samples in Heihe River Basin from July 2012 to August 2013. The typical soil sampling method in Heihe River Basin is representative sampling, which means that the typical soil types in the landscape area can be collected, and the representative sample points should be collected as far as possible. According to the Chinese soil taxonomy, soil samples from each profile were taken based on the diagnostic layers and diagnostic characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of soil data collection within the Heihe River Basin, 'representative sampling' refers to a method aimed at collecting typical soil types from within a landscape area. The goal is to gather samples that are highly representative of the region's soil characteristics. This involves selecting sampling points that can adequately reflect the diversity and key properties of the soil within the designated landscape. The approach is grounded in the Chinese soil classification system, utilizing diagnostic layers and characteristics to guide the sampling of soil profiles.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method employed involves representative sampling, which aims to capture the typical soil types within a landscape region. This approach, based on Chinese soil system classification and diagnostic features, suggests that the method is designed to maximize representativeness by focusing on typical soil types and collecting samples from each soil profile. This may provide a comprehensive overview of soil conditions compared to other methods that might focus on random or grid sampling, which may not target typical soil types as effectively.",
