            "description": "By applying Supply-demand Balance Analysis, the water resource supply and demand of the whole river basin and each county or district were calculated and used to evaluate the vulnerability of the water resources system of the basin. The IPAT equation was used to set a future water resource demand scenario to establish the scenario by setting variables such as future population growth rate, economic growth rate, and unit GDP water consumption. By taking 2005 as the base year and using assorted forecasting data of population size and economic scale, the future water demand scenarios of various counties and cities from 2010 to 2050 were predicted. By applying the basic structure of the HBV conceptual hydrological model of the Swedish Hydrometeorological Institute, a model of the variation tendency of the basin under climate change was designed. The glacial melting scenario was used as the model input to construct the runoff scenario under climate change. According to the national regulations of the water resources allocation of the basin, a water distribution plan was set up to calculate the water supply comprehensively. Considering of the supply and demand situation, the water resource system vulnerability was evaluated by the water shortage rate. By calculating the (grain production) land pressure index of the major counties and cities in the basin, the balance of supply and demand of land resources under the climate change, glacial melt and population growth scenarios was analyzed, and the vulnerability of the agricultural system was evaluated. The Miami formula and HANPP model were used to calculate the human appropriation of net primary biomass and primary biomass in the major counties and cities for the future, and the vulnerability of ecosystems from the perspective of supply and demand balance was assessed.",

                    "Answer": "The assessment of water resource vulnerability in the context of population growth, economic development, and glacier melt scenarios can be inferred by employing a supply-demand balance analysis. This involves calculating the supply and demand of water resources at both the regional and county levels, and using IPAT equations to set future water demand scenarios. The research uses baseline data from 2005 to project future scenarios from 2010 to 2050, incorporating variables like population growth rate, economic growth speed, and GDP water use. Additionally, the HBV hydrological model's basic structure is adapted to model climate change impacts on the basin, using glacier melt scenarios as input to build runoff scenarios. Water allocation schemes are set according to national and local regulations to calculate water supply, and vulnerability is evaluated using water shortage rates.",

                    "Answer": "The vulnerability of water resource systems in the Yarkand River Basin is influenced by several factors, including the calculation of overall and regional water supply and demand, future water demand scenarios using variables such as population growth rate, economic growth speed, and unit GDP water consumption, as well as climate change impacts and glacier melt scenarios.

                    "Answer": "If future water demand scenarios set by the IPAT equation are not accurately predicted, the assessment of water resource system vulnerability may be flawed. This could result in inadequate preparation for water shortages or misallocation of water resources, potentially exacerbating the vulnerability of the system to factors such as population growth, economic development, and climate change. The scenario misalignment could lead to either overestimation or underestimation of water supply and demand balance, affecting the region's ability to manage water resources sustainably.",

Additionally, the goals involve designing a model for watershed changes under climate change scenarios and evaluating the vulnerability of agricultural and ecological systems by analyzing land resource supply-demand balance and calculating net primary productivity and human appropriation of net primary productivity.",
