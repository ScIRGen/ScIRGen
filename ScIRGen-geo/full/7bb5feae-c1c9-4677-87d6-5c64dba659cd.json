            "description": "In the context of global change, the spatio-temporal continuous high-quality high-resolution long time series precipitation data set is of great significance for understanding the global \"water carbon energy\" and biogeochemical cycle mechanism. The daily total volume controlled merging and disaggregation algorithm (DTVCMDA) proposed in this study effectively considers the characteristics of continuous space-time and high spatial and temporal resolution of reanalysed precipitation data, as well as the high quality of ground analysis data, A set of AERA5 Asia (0.1 °, hourly, 1951-2015, Asia) precipitation data set with high quality and high spatial and temporal resolution for more than 70 years of long time series in Asia has been produced. The main features of the dataset are as follows: (1) AERA5 Asia is a set of data sets with high resolution, high quality, space-time continuity and long time series; (2) AERA5 Asia is significantly better than IMERG Final and ERA5 Land precipitation data, especially in terms of system deviation. In general, the deviation of AERA5 Asia, IMERG Final and ERA5 Land compared with ground observation is~5%,~11% and~20% respectively; (3) In extreme heavy rainfall (such as typhoons \"Tamei\" and \"Tiantu\"), the quality of AERA5 Asia is also significantly better than ERA5 Land and IMERG Final.\nAERA5 Asia will provide stable and reliable precipitation data support for relevant research in the weather, climate, hydrology and other fields in Asia, especially in China.",

                "However, the reanalysis products (including ERA5) generally performed worse than the GPM IMERG at the hourly scale and in diurnal cycles in Mainland China; they also performed poorly in western China because of the rugged topography, especially along the boundary of the TP, where the slope is steep, which means that the drastic elevation uplift and complex topography have notable negative effects on the qualities of reanalysis products (Tang et al. 2020). Meanwhile, as pointed by Hersbach et al. (2020), the reanalysis data (e.g., ERA5) generally exhibit nonzero, and often substantial, random errors and biases because of the interactions between the models and the evolving observing system. However, its quality is still unclear, and whether it could be used for generating a long-term precipitation dataset over Asia to extend the limited span of the AIMERG dataset (2000–15) warrants exploration, especially for the critical Asian regions, e.g., the TP (Ma et al. 2017, 2020f)."

                "The ERA5-Land (0.1°, 1-hourly) data are first accumulated to ERA5-Land (0.1°, 1 daily) within a day, and then ERA5-Land (0.1°, 1 daily) data are aggregated to ERA5-Land (0.25°, daily) by spatially averaging the values in the corresponding 3 × 3 window of ERA5-Land (0.1°, daily), where the 3 × 3 window is coordinated to the grids at 0.25° spatial resolution from the APHRODITE dataset. In the long-term period (1951–2015), APHRODITE includes a certain number of grids with no data; in some cases, there are spatially continued no-data grids and simply filling these no-data grids by averaging their valid neighbor grids is inappropriate. Therefore, two situations are considered. If all the nearest eight grids have valid values around the no-data grid, then no-data grid is filled with the value by averaging its eight neighbors. Otherwise, the no-data grid is filled by merging the ERA5-Land and APHRODITE data. The daily spatial variation weight at each grid corresponding to that of ERA5-Land (0.1°, daily) is obtained by calculating the ratio between the current grid value and the average value of the grids in the corresponding 3 × 3 window from the ERA5-Land (0.1°, daily). The hourly temporal variation weight is obtained by calculating the ratio between the current hourly value of ERA5-Land (0.1°, 1-hourly) and the corresponding daily value of ERA5-Land (0.1°, 1 daily) at the same location. The AERA5-Asia (0.1°, daily) dataset is constructed by multiplying the Filled-APHRODITE and the SVM (0.1°, daily), under the total volume controlled by Filled-APHRODITE. The AERA5-Asia (0.1°, hourly) dataset is constructed by multiplying the TVW (0.1°, hourly) and the corresponding daily value of AERA5-Asia (0.1°, daily). In the present study, the Filled-APHRODITE data are considered as the benchmark for deriving the AERA5-Asia dataset. Therefore, one situation should be further processed: the situation where the Filled-APHRODITE data captures a precipitation event with a daily value larger than 0 mm, but the ERA5-Land data do not. In this case, the AERA5-Asia dataset is updated with the values within the day by equally disaggregating the daily observations from the Filled-APHRODITE data at the corresponding grid into 24 periods. The final AERA5-Asia (0.1°, 1-hourly, 1951–2015, Asia) data are generated after all the aforementioned procedures, which takes advantage of both the ERA5-Land data with high resolutions and spatiotemporal continuity and the APHRODITE data with high quality over the Asia."

The ERA5-Land dataset provides much more information at finer spatial resolution than the ERA5 dataset (0.25°). The ERA5-Land reanalysis total precipitation dataset was obtained through the website https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac. The IMERG Final run product (IMERG-Final) is the microwave-infrared estimates and calibrated based on the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) monthly gauge analysis. Currently, it is now available back to June 2000 (0.1°, 0.5 hourly) (Ma et al. 2020f; https://pmm.nasa.gov/data-access/downloads/gpm).

The APHRODITE products are available through the website http://aphrodite.st.hirosaki-u.ac.jp/download/. The hourly point-based precipitation datasets from ~2,400 rain gauge stations in Mainland China, from 2010 to 2014, were collected from the National Meteorological Information Center (NMIC) of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and were adopted as ground truth to evaluate the gridded precipitation estimates at the hourly scale."

AERA5-Asia performs notably better than ERA5-Land and IMERG-Final against ground gauge-based observations in regional extreme rainfall systems (e.g., two typhoon events, Trami and Usagi).
