                "As an international metropolis, Shanghai has diverse driving forces for urban development. Therefore, exploring the dynamic changes in urban space in recent years, assessing the implementation effects of Shanghai's urban development strategies, and investigating the driving forces behind urban changes will help grasp the development direction of Shanghai. This will be beneficial for public decision-making and urban development in the city. Nighttime light remote sensing provides a convenient way to analyze urban spatial changes. Nighttime light data represented by NPP-VIIRS can accurately capture nighttime light signals from cities, residential areas, fishing boats, etc., thereby enabling the extraction of information such as urban boundaries and their development status. Mundia believes that economic growth and transportation influence urban expansion, with cities primarily expanding linearly along roads. Hu Deyong and others, through analyzing the evolution of urban expansion in Changsha, argue that population growth is the main driving force. Feng Qinggong fitted factors such as population, land rent, ecological indicators, and financial industry location entropy with nighttime light intensity, pointing out that the financial agglomeration effect is the main driving force behind the development of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration."
