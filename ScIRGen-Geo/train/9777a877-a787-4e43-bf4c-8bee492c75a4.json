      "description": "The Tibetan Plateau Glacier Data –TPG2017 is a glacial coverage data on the Tibetan Plateau from selected 210 scenes of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images with 30-m spatial resolution from 2013 to 2018, among of which 90% was in 2017 and 85% in winter. Therefore, 2017 was defined as the reference year for the mosaic image. Glacier outlines were digitized on-screen manually from the 2017 image mosaic, relying on false-colour image composites (RGB by bands 654), which allowed us to distinguish ice/snow from cloud. Debris-free ice was distinguished from the debris and debris-covered ice by its higher reflectance. Debris-covered ice was not delineated in this data. The delineated glacier outlines were compared with band-ratio (e.g. TM3/TM5) results, and validated by overlapping them onto Google Earth imagery, SRTM DEM, topographic maps and corresponding satellite images. For areas with mountain shadows and snow cover, they were verified by different methods using data from different seasons. For glaciers in deep shadow, Google EarthTM imagery from different dates was used as the reference for manual delineation. Steep slopes or headwalls were also excluded in the TPG2017. Areas that appeared in any of these sources to have the characteristics of exposed ground/basement/bed rock were manually delineated as non-glacier, and were also cross-checked with CGI-1 and CGI-2. Steep hanging glaciers were included in TPG2017 if they were identifiable on images in all other three epochs (i.e. TPG1976, TPG2001, and TPG2013). The accuracy of manual digitization was controlled within one half-pixel. All glacier areas were calculated on the WGS84 spheroid in an Albers equal-area map projection centred at (95°E, 30°N) with standard parallels at 15°N and 65°N. Our results showed that the relative deviation of manual interpretation was less than 3.9%.",

        "Nearly all mountain glaciers have been melting rapidly in recent decades (Gardner and others, 2013; Zemp and others, 2015) and this has been documented, especially in High Mountain Asia (HMA hereafter), in surveys of the whole (Li and others, 2008; Cogley, 2016) or large parts (Bolch and others, 2012; Yao and others, 2012) of the region as well as in basin-scale and single-glacier studies (Fujita and Nuimura, 2011; Wang and others, 2013; Yang and others, 2013). As reported in these earlier studies, most HMA glaciers showed obvious shrinkage (area loss) and thinning (implying mass loss) except in the west, for example in the Karakoram (Gardelle and others, 2012) and western Kunlun (Neckel and others, 2014; Kääb and others, 2015; Ke and others, 2015). However, due to strong spatiotemporal differences of climate variability and topographic effects, the magnitudes of glacier shrinkage have varied in space and time. The TP, defined by outlines from Zhang and others (2014), can be divided into two categories of hydrological unit, the outlines and basin codes of which we take from Shi and others (2008). Generally, meltwater from glaciers in IB flows into inland depressions, while those in EC flow into the ocean and so contribute more directly to sea-level rise. Climatically, the Indian monsoon dominates in the southeastern TP in summer (e.g. in 5O, 5N, 5L), with some effects from the East Asian monsoon in the east (e.g. in 5Y4, 5J, 5K). The westerlies are dominant in winter, especially in the western TP (e.g. 5Y6, 5Z4, 5Z3). Regions in the interior TP, such as 5Z1, 5Z2, 5Z5, 5Z6 and 5Y5 are less influenced both by the summer monsoon and the westerlies (Yao and others, 2012)."

        "We were unable to remove debris-covered areas from the GAMDAM inventory (GGI) (Nuimura and others, 2015), which includes debris cover but does not distinguish it from debris-free ice. Obviously snow and clouds could have affected glacier delineation, especially in southeastern Tibet where cloudy days are rather frequent in every season. Nor is it likely that the area differences are due to different treatment of debris cover, which is omitted in TGP2001 and included in GAMDAM."

      "methods": [
        "Glacier outlines (TPG1976, TPG2001 and TPG2013) were digitized manually with guidance from the SRTM DEM v4.1 and Google Earth imagery. To achieve complete multi-temporal coverage in a reasonable time, only debris-free ice was delineated. Time series of Landsat scenes were processed with Standard Terrain Correction (Level 1T), which provided systematic radiometric and geometric accuracy by incorporating ground control points while employing SRTM DEM for topographic accuracy. High-quality images with minimal cloud and snow coverage were selected for the delineation of glaciers. Glacier outlines were digitized on-screen manually from the three image mosaics, relying on false-colour image composites (MSS: red, green and blue (RGB) represented by bands 321; TM/ETM+: RGB by bands 543, OLI: RGB by bands 654), which allowed us to distinguish ice and snow from cloud. The manual delineation was carried out by three operators over a period of 6 years. The delineated glacier outlines were validated and edited by different operators at least three times by overlaying them onto Google Earth imagery, DEMs, topographic maps and corresponding satellite images by another two glacier researchers with field survey experience."

        "The comparative analysis of three mosaics shows that glacier area loss across the entire Tibetan Plateau is unequivocal. The glaciers in the M1970-76 subset showed shrinkage at−0.19% a−1 during 1976– 2001 and −0.20% a−1 during 2001– 13. Glaciers in the M1970-88 subset shrank at −0.34% a−1 during 1988 – 2013, and in the M1970-94 subset at −0.42% a−1 during 1994– 2013. The most dramatic glacier shrinkage occurred in the Mekong basin (region 5L) in the southeast, with change rates for M1970s-76 glaciers of −0.43% a−1 during 1976 – 2013 (−0.31% a−1 during 1976– 2001 and −0.73% a−1 during 2001– 13). Glaciers in the western and northern Tibetan Plateau changed at the slowest rates: −0.12% a−1 in 5Y6, −0.14% a−1 in 5Z1, −0.17% a−1 in 5Y5 and −0.17% a−1 in 5Z5 from 1976 to 2013. Overall, glaciers in externally drained catchments showed more dramatic shrinkage than those in the internally drained catchments. This shows a spatial gradient across the plateau of glacier shrinkage rate, decreasing from the southeast to the north and the west."

        "QuestionEn": "Please propose methods to improve the accuracy of glacier delineation in satellite imagery, considering the challenges of cloud cover and seasonal snow.",
        "QuestionCn": "请提出改善卫星影像中冰川划界准确性的方法，考虑到云层覆盖和季节性雪的挑战。",
        "AnswerEn": "To improve the accuracy of glacier delineation in satellite imagery, methods could include using a combination of high-resolution images from different seasons to reduce cloud cover and seasonal snow interference. Advanced image processing techniques, such as machine learning algorithms designed for pattern recognition, can further aid in distinguishing glaciers from clouds and snow. Incorporating ground control points and topographical data from sources like SRTM DEM can enhance geometric accuracy. Additionally, employing a collaborative approach where multiple operators validate and edit delineated outlines can ensure higher precision and reliability in the final glacier data.",
        "AnswerCn": "为了提高卫星影像中冰川划界的准确性，可以采用多种方法，包括使用来自不同季节的高分辨率图像，以减少云层覆盖和季节性雪的干扰。先进的图像处理技术，如专为模式识别设计的机器学习算法，可以进一步帮助区分冰川、云层和雪。此外，结合来自SRTM DEM等来源的地面控制点和地形数据，可以增强几何精度。此外，采用多操作员协作的方法，对划定的轮廓进行验证和编辑，可以确保最终冰川数据的更高精度和可靠性。",
