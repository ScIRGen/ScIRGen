            "description": "The data are the major and rare earth element geochemical data, zircon trace element, U-Pb age and Hf-O isotope data of the early Cretaceous granites in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The samples are S-type granite from Naqu area, and the lithology is monzogranite. The major and rare earth element geochemical data of the samples were obtained by AAS and ICP-OES, respectively. Zircon U-Pb age and REE data were obtained by LA-ICP-MS and SHRIMP analysis, and Lu-Hf isotopic composition was obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. O isotopic composition was obtained by SHRIMP analysis. The above data have been published in SCI Journal (International geology review), and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can be used to study the provenance of Lhasa terrane and the possibility of preserving ancient crust.",
            "instructions": "The data is stored in Excel file and can be opened directly in Excel workbook. The file named \"WR_MajREE\" represents the major and rare earth geochemical data of the whole rock, \"Zrn_HfO\" stands for zircon Hf-O isotope data, \"Zrn_UPbTra \"represents zircon U-Pb age and trace element data.",

                    "Answer": "Geochemical data of whole rock and single minerals refers to the analysis of major and rare earth elements in whole rock samples and individual minerals, such as zircon, obtained from early Cretaceous granites in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This data includes major elements and rare earth element compositions of the whole rock, determined by techniques like AAS and ICP-OES, and trace elements, U-Pb ages, and Hf-O isotopic compositions of zircon, determined using methods like LA-ICP-MS, SHRIMP, and LA-MC-ICP-MS.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in geochemical data collection methods can be caused by the need to accurately analyze different types of elements and isotopes, such as major and rare earth elements, zircon trace elements, U-Pb ages, and Hf-O isotopes. These require distinct analytical techniques like AAS, ICP-OES, LA-ICP-MS, SHRIMP, and LA-MC-ICP-MS, each suited to specific data types. The geographical and geological complexity of the Tibetan Plateau may also necessitate tailored approaches to sample collection and analysis.",

                    "Answer": "To analyze S-type granites for major, trace, and isotopic compositions, the following instrumental and procedural steps are involved: (1) Major and rare earth element geochemical data of whole rock samples are obtained using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). (2) For zircon U-Pb dating and trace element analysis, Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and Sensitive High-Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) are used. (3) Lu-Hf isotopic composition is measured with Laser Ablation Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). (4) Oxygen isotopic composition is determined using SHRIMP analysis. These methods enable the study of the provenance of the Lhasa terrane and the potential preservation of ancient crust in the area.",
