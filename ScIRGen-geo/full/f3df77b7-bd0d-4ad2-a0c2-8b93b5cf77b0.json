            "description": "This dataset is the daily soil temperature data over continental China, with a spatial resolution of 0.25° at six soil depths (i.e., 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 40 cm), and a time range of 1960.01.01-2017.12.31. This dataset is generated through using multiple homogenization method to revise the inhomogenization of data, and using the statistical interpolation methods (i.e., the thin plate spline interpolation method and the angular distance weighting interpolation method) for gridded data processing, based on daily soil temperature data at more than 2400 meteorological stations across mainland of China. This dataset can well reflect the variation characteristics of soil temperature in China, and it can be used as the basic data in the field of future climate change research.",

                "Terrestrial soil contains huge heat, which supports food and energy for humans and land ecosystem survival. The soil heat content is also an important energy source affecting regional atmospheric circulation and climate change. Changes in soil heat storage have significant effects on many aspects of the earth system, such as climate, water, and ecology. As a conventional indicator of soil heat, soil temperature (TS) shows significant effects on the respiration of organic soil layers, which in turn influences the rate of organic carbon released into the atmosphere as CO2. TS also plays a pivotal role in the exchange of energy and water vapour between the atmosphere and land surface, and it can affect the partition of net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes, which will then influence the circulation in the atmospheric boundary layer. In addition, the impact of TS on local atmospheric processes may also propagate downstream through dynamic and thermodynamic processes and then influence the climate in remote regions. Moreover, many studies have shown that the antecedent TS in arid/semiarid regions of Northwest China can be one of the predictors of climate change in the Eastern Plain region. TS is one of the routinely measured quantities at meteorological stations. However, due to the complex terrain, human activities and severe weather conditions, the meteorological stations are not evenly distributed. In climate research, gridded products have a great attraction for data users due to their ease of use. These products include global data sets, such as GPCC (the Global Precipitation Climatology Center), CRU (the Climatic Research Unit), and regional data sets, such as the gauge-based daily precipitation data set over East Asia, APRODITE (the Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data), and CN05.1 (the daily meteorological data set over mainland China). In China, observations of TS at multiple soil depths have been available from more than 2,000 stations since 1960. Researchers have made great efforts to develop various methods for interpolating irregular station observations to uniform gridded data sets."

Moreover, other objective factors, for example, the uneven distribution of stations, the timing discontinuity of observations caused by station migration and equipment damage, may also limit the use of observational TS records."

Finally, a gridded multilayer TS data set is constructed from the sum of the above two gridded products.

In China, observations of TS at multiple soil depths have been available from more than 2,000 stations since 1960. We recently conducted a homogenized procedure to eliminate non-climate-inducing errors in this TS data set and obtained a homogenized long-term continuous TS data set at six soil depths at 2360 stations in China for 1960–2017."

                "Land surface temperature (LST) is a fundamental parameter in the climate field that is indicative of the thermal radiance from the ground surface. It directly influences the sensible and latent heat fluxes from the land surface to the planetary boundary layer. Changes in LST and soil temperature can also be used as indicators of climate change. Furthermore, several researchers have considered the difference between LST and land surface air temperature (LSAT) as a teleconnection factor to predict changes in precipitation in downstream regions. Long-term instrumental LST data have been collected and stored for many decades in China. As one of the conventional observations, LST is liable to be influenced by changes in non-climatic factors (e.g., station migration, equipment replacement, and changes in the environment around the station location). If we keep such inhomogeneities and directly analyze the raw data, which may inaccurately describe actual climate variations, then we will potentially reach incorrect conclusions, particularly in the representation of long-term trends and extremes. Therefore, it is necessary to homogenize the raw observed LST before it can be used as the “ground truth” in various applications. To homogenize the LST dataset, several methods have been developed and applied in different countries. Previous studies have mainly focused on homogenizing LST datasets on monthly time scales. The daily LST can describe temporal variations at synoptic scales and is a needed parameter in weather forecasting as well as in modeling applications."
