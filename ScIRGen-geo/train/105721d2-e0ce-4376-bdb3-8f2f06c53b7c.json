Diurnal variation in the radiative temperature was recorded as well. Raw data, blackbody calibrated data and processed data were archived in Excel format.\n     (2) the surface radiative temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer (FOV:1°; accuracy: 0.1°C) in Yingke oasis maize field and wheat field, Huazhaizi desert maize field, No. 1 and 2 plots, and the maize field at the resort on May 20, 28, 30 and 31, Jun. 1, 4, 16 and 29, Jul. 4, 7 and 11, 2008. Besides, the four component temperature was also measured in Yingke oasis maize field and wheat field, Huazhaizi desert maize field. Raw data and processed data on the surface radiative temperature were archived.",

In contrast, the handheld infrared thermometers have a view angle of 1° and a temperature sensitivity of 0.1°C, providing maximum, minimum, and average radiation temperatures during sampling. Fixed instruments offer continuous multi-temporal data, while handheld devices provide more targeted measurements across different plots. Both methods require vertical observation, but the fixed instruments also serve calibration purposes for thermal infrared camera flights.",

                    "Question": "How do the different instruments used in a dataset with varying field view angles and emissivity affect the accuracy and consistency of surface radiation temperature measurements across diverse land cover types?",
                    "Answer": "The use of different instruments, such as fixed self-recording thermometers with a 10° field of view and handheld infrared thermometers with a 1° field of view, can lead to variations in accuracy and consistency of surface radiation temperature measurements. These differences are further influenced by the emissivity settings of the instruments, which range from 0.95 to 1.0. Measurements are affected by the type of land cover, such as corn canopies, bare soil, and desert vegetation, which can influence the emissivity and thus the temperature readings. Additionally, calibration processes like radiation calibration and emissivity correction are necessary to ensure consistency and accuracy of the processed temperature data.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of specific instruments like fixed thermometers and handheld infrared thermometers is influenced by the need to measure continuous radiation temperature at multiple time phases across varied sample plots, which include different types of vegetation and surface conditions. The instruments' field of view, sampling interval, and emissivity are tailored to capture the detailed thermal characteristics of areas such as cornfields, wheat fields, and desert plots, ensuring accurate calibration of airborne and satellite data.",

                    "Answer": "The goal was to capture multi-temporal continuous radiation temperature across different sample plots, including agricultural and desert environments, and to ensure comprehensive calibration of airborne and satellite thermal infrared data. The use of both instrument types allowed for detailed observations of temperature variations in different land cover types such as cornfields, wheat fields, and desert plots, as well as calibration during airborne thermal infrared camera flights.",
