            "titleEn": "WATER: Dataset of forest structure parameter measurements for the fixed forest sampling plots in the Dayekou and Pailugou watershed foci experimental areas (2003-3007)",
            "description": "The fixed forest sample plot is located in the drainage ditch of Dayekou, Qilian Mountain, where the hydrological observation field of Gansu Water Conservation Forest Research Institute is located. \nFrom July 2003 to August 2003 and from July 2007 to August 2007, the tree survey of the sample plot was completed by technicians from Gansu Water Conservation Forest Research Institute and Institute of environment and Engineering in cold and dry areas of Chinese Academy of Sciences. A total of 17 fixed forest samples were observed, including the survey of sample plot factors and the survey of each tree. The observation factors of sample plots mainly include forest farm, longitude and latitude coordinates, slope direction, slope position, slope, soil thickness, canopy density of arbor layer, leaf area index, etc. The main instruments used in the measurement are tape, DBH, flower pole, tree measuring instrument, compass and fish eye camera. The measurement factors of each tree include DBH, height of tree, height under branch, crown width in cross slope direction, crown width along slope direction, growth status of single tree, etc. \nFor details, please refer to the metadata of \"Heihe River Integrated Remote Sensing joint test: fixed sample plot tree survey data set (2003)\" and \"Heihe River Integrated Remote Sensing joint test: fixed sample plot tree survey data set (2007)\". \nThe Lai in this data set is the supplementary measurement data during the joint remote sensing experiment of Heihe River in 2008. That is to say, the supplementary measurement of Lai has been done in these fixed plots. The supplementary observation time of Lai was from June 1 to 13, 2008. 15 of the 17 fixed plots were investigated. Four instruments were used to observe each plot. In addition to the commercial instruments such as hemiview fish eye camera, LAI-2000 and trac, these instruments also use the canopy analysis instrument made by Beijing Normal University. In each 20 m × 20 m plot, trac measures along two parallel routes perpendicular to the direction of sunlight incidence, which can basically represent the entire quadrat; hemiview fisheye camera and LAI-2000 measure the same points, that is, take three points on the trac line, plus the center point of the quadrat, a total of 7 measuring points. \nThis set of data set can provide ground data for the study of remote sensing inversion method of forest structure parameters.",

The instruments employed in this method include tape measures, calipers, height poles, tree-measuring instruments, compasses, and fisheye cameras. Further, LAI measurements are supplemented using commercial instruments like HemiView fisheye cameras, LAI-2000, TRAC, and a custom canopy analyzer developed by Beijing Normal University. Observations are conducted at multiple points within each 20m x 20m plot, aligning with the incoming sunlight direction for accurate representation of the plot's characteristics.",

Commercial instruments are generally validated tools with standardized methodologies that are widely accepted and used, offering reliability and comparability across studies. Custom-made instruments, on the other hand, may provide unique advantages tailored to specific research needs or may offer innovative measurement techniques. However, the accuracy and data comprehensiveness might vary based on calibration, design, and the specific application context. In the field above, both types of instruments were used to achieve a comprehensive understanding of forest structure parameters.",

This multi-instrument approach allows for cross-validation between different methods, potentially reducing measurement errors and increasing reliability.

                    "Answer": "The goal is to provide comprehensive and accurate measurements of forest structure parameters, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), to support research on remote sensing inversion methods for forest structure. By using multiple instruments, researchers can ensure a more reliable dataset that represents different aspects of the forest canopy and structure, ultimately aiding in the advancement of remote sensing technologies and methodologies.",

                    "Answer": "Forest structural parameters such as canopy density and leaf area index are measured using a variety of instruments including tape measures, diameter tapes, measuring poles, dendrometers, compasses, and fisheye cameras. Measurements are conducted on designated sample plots, with data collected on factors like tree diameter at breast height, tree height, under-branch height, cross-slope crown width, along-slope crown width, and individual tree growth conditions. In addition, LAI measurements are supplemented using instruments like HemiView fisheye cameras, LAI-2000, TRAC, and a custom-made canopy analyzer from Beijing Normal University. The TRAC instrument measures along two parallel lines perpendicular to the sunlight direction to represent the entire plot, while HemiView and LAI-2000 measurements are taken at specific points along these lines, including at the plot center.",
