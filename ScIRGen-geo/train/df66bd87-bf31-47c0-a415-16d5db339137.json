            "description": "This dataset contains the ground surface water (including liquid water, glacier and perennial snow) area in Qilian Mountain Area from 1980 to 2015. The dataset was produced based on classical Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) extraction criterion and manual editing. Landsat images collected between 1978 and 2018 were used as basic data for water index extraction. Sentinel-2 images and Google images were employed as reference data for adjusting the extraction threshold. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates and water area. Consisting of 8 seasons, the dataset has a temporal resolution of 5 years and a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±30 meter). The dataset directly reflects the variation of water distribution within the Qilian Mountain in the past 35 years, and can be used for quantitative estimation of water resource.",

                    "Answer": "The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a method used to extract water body distribution by enhancing water body features while suppressing vegetation and soil background. It involves using satellite imagery data, such as Landsat series images, to calculate the index and identify water bodies including liquid water, glaciers, and perennial snow. The NDWI is often complemented with manual corrections to improve accuracy and is used to create water body distribution products that reflect temporal changes in water bodies over time.",

                    "Answer": "The approach in the field utilizes the NDWI combined with manual correction to extract surface water bodies, focusing on Landsat series images from 1978-2018. This method is enhanced with reference data from Google and Sentinel-2 imagery, providing a time series distribution over 35 years, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. It offers a structured temporal segmentation into 8 periods with 5-year intervals. Compared to other data collection methods that might use different satellite sources or indices, this approach emphasizes a long-term, consistent temporal analysis and spatial precision at a 30-meter resolution, which could be beneficial for detailed studies of water body changes over time.",

This approach allows for the refinement of data accuracy through manual corrections, leading to a more reliable dataset for water resource estimation in the region.",
