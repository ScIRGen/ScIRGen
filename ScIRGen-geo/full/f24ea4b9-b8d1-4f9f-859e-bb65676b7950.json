            "description": "The data set contains the flux observation data of large aperture scintillator from daman station in the middle reaches of heihe hydrometeorological observation network.The large aperture scintiometer of German BLS450_NQ and Dutch Kipp&zonen models has been installed at the dameng station in the middle reaches. The north tower is the receiving end of Kipp&zonen and the transmitting end of BLS450_NQ, and the south tower is the transmitting end of Kipp&zonen and the receiving end of BLS450_NQ.The observation period of BLS450_NQ is from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, and the observation period of Kipp&zonen is from January 1, 2014 to March 1, 2014.The station is located in dazman irrigation district, zhangye city, gansu province. The underlying surface involves corn, orchards and greenhouses, but mainly corn.The latitude and longitude of the north tower is 100.379 E, 38.861 N, and the latitude and longitude of the south tower is 100.369 E, 38.847 N, with an altitude of about 1556m.The effective height of the large aperture scintillator is 22.45m, the optical diameter length is 1854m, and the sampling frequency is 1min.\nLarge aperture flicker meter raw observation data for 1 min, data released for 30 min after processing and quality control of data, including sensible heat flux is mainly combined with the automatic meteorological station observation data, based on similarity theory alonzo mourning - Mr. Hoff is obtained by iterative calculation, the quality control of the main steps include: (1) excluding Cn2 reach saturation data (BLS450_NQ: Cn2 > 1.43 e-13, Kipp&zonen: Cn2 e-13 > 1.54);(2) data with weak demodulation signal strength were eliminated (BLS450_NQ: Mininum X<50, Kipp&zonen: Demod>-20mv);(3) data at the time of precipitation were excluded;(4) data of weak turbulence under stable conditions were excluded (u* < 0.1m/s).In the iterative calculation process, for BLS450_NQ, the stability universal function of Thiermann and Grassl, 1992 was selected.For Kipp&zonen, take Andreas 1988's stability universal function.Please refer to Liu et al.(2011, 2013) for detailed introduction.\nSome notes on the released data :(1) the data of mid-range LAS is mainly BLS450_NQ, the missing moment is supplemented by Kipp&zonen observation, and the missing of both is marked by -6999.(2) missing period: on June 21, 2014, solstice, 27, due to the lack of data from the automatic meteorological station, the sensible heat flux H_LAS observed at LAS during this period could not be calculated;On June 29, 2014, solstice on July 2, July 21, solstice 22, September 24, solstice 25, and December 21, solstice 30, data was missing due to LAS instrument failure.(3) data table head: Date/Time: Date/Time (format: yyyy-m-d h:mm), Cn2: structural parameters of air refraction index (unit: m-2/3), H_LAS: sensible heat flux (unit: W/m2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Li et al.(2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al.(2011) for observation data processing.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022).
