            "description": "Ecosystem Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is a key parameter in the study of global change. It provides a basis for applying ecological methods to study the carbon flux, carbon storage and carbon cycle of ecosystems, and to evaluate the global carbon balance, regional contribution and response of ecosystems. At present, MODIS satellite data product is an important data source for retrieving the total primary productivity of ecosystems. The 500-meter and annual MODIS ecosystem net primary productivity dataset of  key nodes (2002-2014) is obtained and stored by tailoring and estimating  the biomass and organic carbon accumulation in 18 key nodes (Bangkok, Burma_Port, Chittagong, Colombo, Dhaka, Gwadar_Port, Hambantota, Huangjing_Port_and_Malacca, Karachi, Kolkata, Kuantan, Maldives, Mandalay, Mumbai, Sihanouk, Taizhong_Luoyong, Vientiane, Yangon) from 2002 to 2014 from MODIS products (MYD17A3H).",
