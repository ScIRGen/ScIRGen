            "description": "The Optimum Interpolation sea surface temperature (OISST) analysis product provides complete ocean temperature fields constructed by using an optimum interpolation (OI) technique. The SST analysis has a spatial grid resolution of 0.25 degree and temporal resolution of 1 day. The product uses Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from the Pathfinder AVHRR SST dataset when available for September 1981 through December 2005, and the operational Navy AVHRR Multi-Channel SST data for 2006 to the present day. Pathfinder AVHRR SST was chosen because of good agreement with the in-situ observation data. The product also uses sea ice datasets, in situ data from ships and buoys, and includes a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in-situ data. In areas where sea ice is present, SST is estimated from sea ice concentration datasets from NASA GSFC before 2005 and then from NOAA NCEP from 2005 onwards. The SST product is of great importance in the study of storm tide. Based on the SST product from 1981 to 2016, GEE was used to tailor the masks of the sea area along the Blet and Road. Finally, the 16-day synthetic sea surface temperature dataset of the sea area along the Blet and Road from 1981 to 2016 was obtained.",

In contrast, in situ observations from ships and buoys provide ground-truth measurements but are limited in spatial coverage and may not capture rapid temporal changes. The dataset mentioned prioritizes AVHRR data due to its good agreement with in situ observations, supplemented by in situ data for large-scale satellite bias adjustments.",

Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from Pathfinder and the Navy's AVHRR multichannel sea surface temperature data are chosen due to their good agreement with field observations. The optimal interpolation (OI) technique is used to construct a complete ocean temperature field. Additionally, the use of sea ice datasets from ships and buoys, as well as large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with field data, are crucial. In areas with sea ice, sea surface temperature is estimated using sea ice concentration data provided by NASA GSFC before 2005 and NOAA NCEP after 2005.",

The use of advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, along with field data from ships and buoys, allows for better alignment with actual conditions, while sea ice data helps accurately estimate sea temperatures in icy regions.",
