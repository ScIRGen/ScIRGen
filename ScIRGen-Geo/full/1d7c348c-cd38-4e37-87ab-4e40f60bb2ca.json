Where the river steepness index and concavity index were extracted based on the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) 3 arc-seconds DEM data, the catchment erosion rate are from Palumbo et al. (2010) and Palumbo et al. (2011), and the precipitation data is from Geng et al. (2017). In order to increase the credibility of the data, the range of the river steepness index of each basin is given when the confidence is 95%. The data laid a foundation for the analysis of the relationship between the geomorphic characteristics and the tectonic framework of Qilian Shan.",

However, the relationship between precipitation and topography across arid to semiarid orogens has received little attention because of limited data availability. Elevated terrain has a profound effect on the spatial distribution of precipitation. The spatially varied precipitation pattern could impose a theoretical feedback via erosional processes on fluvial network and topographic characteristics. Moreover, precipitation-focused erosion rates are proposed to regulate tectonic deformation and drive isostatic uplift to accommodate orographically enhanced precipitation. Accordingly, the spatial correlation of precipitation pattern and topographic features could provide insights into the competing role of tectonics and climate in shaping mountainous topography. The Qilian Shan Mountains on the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau are undergoing recent and ongoing uplift but are in an arid to semiarid climate. Thus, these mountains represent an ideal location to test the extent to which theory developed in the humid Himalayas can be more widely applied."

                "AnswerEn": "The spatial variability in precipitation is a challenge in complex terrains due to limited data availability. One approach is to use high-resolution satellite data, like GPM precipitation with a spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1°, and to compare these with weather-station-based estimates. However, mismatches may occur due to the coarse resolution of satellite data relative to the fine-scale variability in precipitation.",
