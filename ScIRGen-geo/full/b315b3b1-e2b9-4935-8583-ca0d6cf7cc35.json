            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace elements, Sr-Nd-Pb-Mg isotopic geochemical data, zircon U-Pb age data and Hf isotopic geochemical data and Sulfide sulfur isotope data of Yanshanian intermediate-acid rocks in the northern margin of North China and its adjacent areas. The major data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the Sr-Nd-Pb-Mg isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. Zircon U-Pb age data were obtained by LA-ICP-MS and SIMS analysis, and Hf isotope data were obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis.  Sulfide sulfur isotope data were obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals (Mg isotope data has not been published), and the data are true and reliable. Through the obtained data, we can find out the temporal and spatial distribution of magmatism, the variation of petrochemistry and isotopic composition in the study area, analyze the properties of rock source area, melting conditions and magmatic evolution process in detail, trace the dynamic process of tectono-magmatic process, and analyze the constraints of superposition and transformation of the tectonic domains of the Okhotsk Ocean and the Pacific Ocean on magmatism and mineralization in the area, The time limit from subduction, extinction to mutual transformation of the paleo oceanic crust will provide a key constraint for revealing the relationship between the deep process of Yanshanian movement and magma mineralization.",

                "The volcanic rocks consist of dacites, rhyolites and rhyolitic tuffs. Laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry zircon U–pb dating results suggest that the rocks were erupted during the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (161–117 Ma). They belong to the high-K calc-alkaline series and can be divided into two groups. Group I rocks are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, contain low concentrations of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and high field strength elements (HFSEs), and have low zircon saturation temperatures (average 786 °C), all of which indicate an I-type affinity. In contrast, Group II rocks have higher HREE and HFSE concentrations and zircon saturation temperatures (average 918 °C), suggesting an A-type affinity. Our data indicate that the i-type felsic volcanic rocks formed from magmas generated by partial melting of a dominantly juvenile mica-bearing K-rich basaltic lower crust, whereas the A-type felsic volcanic rocks originated from the partial melting of a dry mafic–intermediate middle–lower crust that was dehydrated but not melt depleted."
