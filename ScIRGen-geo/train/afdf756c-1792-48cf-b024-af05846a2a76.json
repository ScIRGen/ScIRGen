            "description": "Ecosystem services are many benefits provided by ecosystem for human beings. Soil conservation, as one of the main regulating services provided by terrestrial ecosystem, is an important guarantee to prevent regional land degradation and reduce the frequency of flood disasters. Soil conservation (SC) is often used to evaluate. As an important part of the national ecological security strategy, it is of far-reaching significance to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of soil conservation in the Qinghai Tibet plateau for the construction of ecological civilization and sustainable development in China. Based on the modified universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), the 8 km resolution soil conservation data set (1990-2015) of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau was generated using GIMMS NDVI 3gv1.0 data, aster GDEM, meteorological stations and Chinese soil data set.",
