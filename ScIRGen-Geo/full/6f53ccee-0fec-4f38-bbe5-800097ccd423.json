            "description": "The Asia Water Tower region, with the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at its core, is the most widespread region of snow cover on Earth, except for the North and South Poles. The topographic heterogeneity of the Asian Water Tower region is so great that the snow cover is thin and patchy, resulting in a highly time-varying snow cover in the region, and therefore daily-scale fractional snow cover data are urgently needed. This dataset is based on the MODIS global surface reflectance product MO/YD09GA product, and the MODIS daily cloud-free snow cover dataset for the Asian water tower region from 2000 to 2022 was constructed using the MESMA-AGE algorithm and the MSTI algorithm. This dataset has a time series from 26 February 2000 to 31 December 2022 with a spatial resolution of 0.005°, which can provide quantitative snow cover information on the spatial distribution of snow for mountain hydrological models, land surface models, numerical weather forecasts, etc.",

                "Snow cover has the characteristics of high albedo, low emissivity and strong water-holding energy. The extent and variability of snow cover have profound implications for global and regional water and energy cycles and climate change. The Asian Water Tower region centered on the Tibetan Plateau is the region with the largest snow accumulation outside the North Pole and South Pole. In recent years, this region has been in a state of imbalance, which is mainly reflected in the massive conversion of snow (one of the two forms of solid water) into liquid water. Furthermore, since 2008, the snow cover in the Asian Water Tower region has surpassed the tipping point and has become unstable, which has a strong and stable relationship with the changes in the Amazon rainforest ecosystem. Remote sensing technology has become an essential tool for monitoring snow cover globally. Polar orbit satellites such as NOAA/AVHRR, the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat and Sentinel-2, which are often used to monitor snow cover, have spatial resolutions ranging from meters to kilometers. Toward the requirement of daily, large-scale and long-term series of fractional snow cover monitoring, only moderate- to coarse-resolution sensors such as AVHRR and MODIS are currently available. However, multispectral images at moderate and coarse spatial resolution have mixed pixels near the snow line, the edge zone of snow patches and the forest area covered by snow. The classification of snow and non-snow alone will lead to significant overestimation or underestimation. The MEAMA-AGE algorithm is a kind of automatic extraction of pure snow and non-snow endmembers based on the single-band reflectance of MODIS multispectral images and the normalized differential snow index (NDSI), normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized differential water index (NDWI), and then the fractional snow cover is retrieved by the MESMA-AGE algorithm. This algorithm can ensure the representativeness of the endmember, improve the computational efficiency and effectively adapt to the characteristics of strong topographic heterogeneity and thin and broken snow, with better accuracy and robustness than other algorithms."
