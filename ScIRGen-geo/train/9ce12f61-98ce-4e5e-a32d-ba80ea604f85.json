            "description": "The Qilian-Haiyuan fault Zone is one of the most active fault zones in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau, especially the Haiyuan fault zone, which has historically experienced several destructive earthquakes of Mw 7-8. On January 8, 2022, a Mw 6.7 earthquake occurred Menyuan, Qinghai Province, China, the epicenter was located the northeastern edge of the Qilian Mountains, causing severe damage to local transportation infrastructure. In the past 35 years, three Mw~6 earthquakes have occurred in this area. This dataset is based on GF-7 and Sentinel-1 satellite image data. The surface rupture zone of the 2022 Menyuan earthquake was identified by visual interpretation after processing GF-7 satellite image orthorectification, image fusion, stitching and cropping. Based on the InSAR technique, the coseismic deformation fields of the 2016 and 2022 Mengyuan earthquakes were obtained by processing the Sentinel-1 SAR images. This dataset is expected to contribute to the study of the Qinghai Mengyuan earthquake and the future exploration of rupture activity characteristics and seismic hazard assessment in the region.",
            "instructions": "The basic format of data naming is YYYYMYEQ_XX.XX, where YYYY represents the time, MYEQ represents the Menyuan earthquake and XX.XX represents the data result type and format. GF-7 images are presented as tif files with the file name 2022MYEQ_GF7.tif. InSAR data of the 2016 and 2022 portal source earthquakes are presented as grd files, where FIL stands for InSAR results,  ASC stands for ascending data, and DSE stands for descending data. The coseismic deformation field downsampling files are inp files. The inp files are in ASCII format, where QUAD stands for quadratic tree downsampling and utm stands for downsampling files in the UTM coordinate system. The tif and grd data can be opened with Arcgis or GMT, and inp files can be edited with text editors such as Matlab or Notepad for tomographic parameter inversion. The Gf-7 image‘s spatial resolution is 0.67m. The InSAR image's spatial resolution is 30m.",
