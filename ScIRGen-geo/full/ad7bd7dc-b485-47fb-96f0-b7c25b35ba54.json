            "description": "Glaciers are sensitive to climate change and are important indicators and amplifiers of global change. In inland river regions, river runoff mainly comes from mountain ice and snow melt. Glaciers are very important \"solid reservoirs\" in these regions, and glacial melt water is an important source of supply for the tributaries of the Heihe River.\nThe inventory of glaciers in the Heihe River Basin was completed from 1979 to 1980. For related information, please refer to \"Chinese Glacier Inventory-Qilian Mountains\" edited by Wang Zongtai and others. In 2004, the relevant results of the \"China Glacier Inventory\" were systematically digitized and a database was established. The final results were released through the \"China Glacier Information System\". However, in the process of coordinate restoration, the accuracy of the reference data was poor, and the glaciers in the Heihe River Basin had obvious position shifts. Therefore, we used the Landsat remote sensing image corrected by ortho-geometric correction. The processed Heihe Glacier distribution data is highly consistent with the existing basic geographic information in China in terms of geometric accuracy, and consistent with the first glacier inventory in terms of attributes.",

This correction is necessary to address issues such as positional shifts that may occur due to inaccuracies in the reference materials used during the initial mapping or cataloging of glacier distributions.",

                    "Answer": "The glacier distribution data from the initial catalog in 1979-1980 has noticeable positional shifts due to low precision of reference materials used during coordinate restoration. In contrast, the data adjusted using orthorectified Landsat remote sensing imagery achieves high geometric accuracy, ensuring alignment with existing geographical information systems while maintaining consistency with the attributes of the initial glacier catalog.",
