            "description": "The RCM employed is the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4, Giorgi et al., 2012). The domain used is the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Phase II East Asia domain, covering whole of China and its surrounding East Asia areas. The model is run at 25 km gird spacing, with its standard configuration of 18 vertical sigma layers with a model top at 10 hPa. Configuration of the model follows Gao et al. (2016, 2017), with land cover data over China was updated as reported by Han et al. (2015) to better represent the realistic vegetation. The initial and lateral boundary conditions needed to drive RegCM4 are derived from the CMIP5 models of HadGEM2-ES (RCP4.5 pathways), and the data set include temperature and precipitation.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection technique using the RegCM4 regional climate model involves a horizontal resolution of 25 km and vertical layers extending up to 10 hPa, specifically for the East Asia region recommended by CORDEX Phase II. It incorporates updated land cover data for China to describe vegetation conditions, as per Gao et al. (2016, 2017) and Han Zhenyu et al. (2015). The initial and boundary conditions are provided by the CMIP5 global climate model HadGEM2-ES under the RCP4.5 scenario, focusing on temperature and precipitation elements. Comparatively, other regional climate models may differ in spatial resolution, vertical stratification, and input data sources, affecting the precision and applicability of future meteorological predictions in East Asia.",

                    "Answer": "The horizontal resolution of 25 km allows for relatively detailed spatial representation of climate phenomena, capturing regional variability within East Asia. The vertical layering up to 10 hPa provides a comprehensive view of atmospheric processes, contributing to more accurate climate predictions by capturing interactions between different atmospheric layers. This can enhance the ability to model complex climate dynamics and predict future trends in temperature and precipitation.",

The simulation area is defined as the recommended region for the CORDEX Phase II East Asia, covering China and surrounding regions. The model's parameter settings are based on previous work by Gao et al. (2016, 2017) and include updated land cover data for China to accurately describe vegetation conditions. Initial and lateral boundary conditions are derived from the CMIP5 global climate model HadGEM2-ES simulations under the RCP4.5 scenario.
