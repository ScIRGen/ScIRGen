            "description": "Tropical terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in regulating global carbon balance. However, the complex interannual dynamics of aboveground biomass carbon (AGC) in tropical regions have not been fully elucidated. By combining low-frequency L-band passive microwave observation (L-VOD) and optical satellite observation, we calculated the interannual dynamics of tropical aboveground biomass carbon losses (including losses caused by fire, deforestation, and degradation) and gains. The results indicate a moderate net AGC sink of 0.21±0.06 PgC yr-1 throughout the global tropics from 2010–2020. This arises from a gross loss of -1.79 PgC yr-1 offset by a marked gain of 2.01±0.06 PgC yr-1. ",
            "instructions": "The data on aboveground biomass carbon losses and gains in tropical regions are stored in GeoTIFF format, with file names of \"AGC_losses_2010-2020.tif\" and \"AGC_gains_2011-2020.tif\", respectively. The two Tiff files have 11 and 10 bands respectively, corresponding to the annual data from 2010-2020 and 2011-2020.",
