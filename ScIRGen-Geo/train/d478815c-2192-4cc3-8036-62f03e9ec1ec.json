      "description": "The climate change in Asia is jointly influenced by different climate systems of westerly and monsoon, with significant regional differences and complex spatiotemporal evolution. The widely distributed loess paleosol sedimentary sequence in inland Asia is an important record carrier for revealing the laws of past climate change. Luminescence dating is the main technical means for loess dating, and the analysis of paleoclimate proxy indicators is the basis for reconstructing past climate changes recorded in loess. The dataset summarizes the luminescence dating and paleoclimate proxy indicator data of 128 loess paleosol profiles spanning from northwest Iran to northeast China. The luminescence dating data includes 1785 quartz age data and 1038 potassium feldspar age data and calculated parameter data, as well as high-resolution age depth model data of 38 loess paleosol sequences. The paleoclimate proxy index data includes 12365 grain size data, 14964 Magnetic susceptibility data, 2204 carbonate data and 3326 chroma data. This dataset is the most detailed luminescence dating and paleoclimate proxy indicator data for Asian loess that has been released so far. This dataset will provide data support for analyzing the formation era, sedimentary processes, and mechanisms of the Asian loess paleosol sequence, as well as reconstructing past westerly and monsoon climate changes at different time scales. Therefore, it is of great significance for the study of Asian paleoclimate change.",

Previously, most studies of loess-palaeosol sequences were carried out on river bank sections of the Ob river around Novosibirsk and upstream of this location (Ob Loess plateau); more recently, the focus of research has shifted towards the inner part of the Cis-Altai plain. Despite a good knowledge of the structure of regional loess-palaeosol sequences, there is a considerable lack of absolute dating beyond the radiocarbon limit. Wind-blown dust has created one of the most important archives of changes in the natural environment on a regional and global scale in the Pleistocene. The loess-palaeosol horizons formed during the Pleistocene in Western Siberia have been compared with several main global climatic records - with the marine stages of the isotope oxygen curve, the record of Lake Baikal, and the Vostok station Antarctic ice cores, as well as with loess-palaeosol series in China, Central Asia, Ukraine, Russian Plain, Central Siberia. Loess deposits are widespread in the south of Western Siberia and form part of the Siberian loess region, an important component of the Eurasian loess belt.

The HB loess section records continuous environmental information from c. 50 to c. 30 ka, i.e. throughout Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Mass accumulation rates (MARs) varied considerably over this period with increased dust accumulation around c. 38 ka and after c. 32 ka; in between, and at the beginning of MIS 3 (50–40 ka), the dust accumulation rate was ~50% lower. Finally, the HB section also records a MIS 2 hiatus of c. 17 ka duration, probably resulting from deflation. This study implies that loess deposition on the TP is predominantly an interglacial/interstadial phenomenon and the TP may be deflating at the same time as the Chinese Loess Plateau is accumulating, at least during MIS 2."

Dust activities can be influenced by climate change through changing ground surface conditions and atmospheric circulation and can contribute to climate change through the absorption and scattering of solar radiation in the atmosphere and changing ocean productivity. Past dust activities at tectonic-to suborbital-scales under various climate boundaries (e.g., glacial and interglacial) have been represented using loess, desert dunes, ocean sediments, and ice-core sediments. Aeolian-formed terrestrial loess has been extensively examined in regard to the reconstruction of past dust mass accumulation rates (MARs) or dust fluxes. Loess on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) has been used to reconstruct past dust activities at tectonic-, orbital-, and suborbital scales, mostly linked to East Asian summer and winter monsoon circulation. Vast arid-semiarid regions in Central Asia contribute greatly to the Northern Hemisphere regional- and global-scale dust cycles.

It is surrounded by northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), the Tengger, Mu Us deserts, the Yinshan mountains, the Taihang mountains, and the Qinling mountains (Xiao et al., 2012). The Quaternary loess-paleosol sequences of the CLP were wind-blown silts that derived from arid areas in northwestern China and eastern central Asia (Liu, 1965, 1985). Recently, geomorphological, stratigraphic, geochemical, and zircon U-Pb chronological studies all regard the northern and northeastern QTP also as one important source region for silts deposited in the CLP (An et al., 2012; Bird et al., 2015; Bowler et al., 1987; Che and Li, 2013; Kapp et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Licht et al., 2016; Nie et al., 2014, 2015; Pullen et al., 2011; Stevens et al., 2013). Recent observations ﬁnd that sand dust storms in QTP occurred frequently during winter and spring seasons every year, and a wide range of mobile dunes and desertiﬁcation lands in QTP provided plenty of materials for sand dust storms to carry (E C.Y. et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008; Yu and Lai, 2012). Because the average elevation of QTP is more than 3000 m above sea level, ﬁne particles in QTP can be easily raised up into the westerly jet-stream and transported eastward, some can even reached to remote North Paciﬁc region (Fang et al., 2004; Han et al., 2004). Fluvio-lacustrine sediments in the western and central Qaidam basin suffered from strong wind erosion since the Pliocene, implying it might be a potential source region for Quaternary loess in the CLP (Heermance et al., 2013; Nie et al., 2014). A recent quantitative study proposed that sediments in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River and ﬂuvio-lacustrine sediments in Qaidam basin contributed more than 75% of the sediments that accumulated in the CLP (Licht et al., 2016)."

        "Wind-blown dust deposits on the Chinese Loess Plateau form some of the most important archives of monsoon climate and atmospheric dust deposition of the late Cenozoic. Sequences of loess and palaeosol units preserve the alternation of winter and summer East Asian monsoon-dominant climates through the Quaternary, Pliocene, Miocene and potentially the late Eocene–Oligocene. The Chinese Loess Plateau dust deposits are some of the most extensively studied climate archives on the planet; there is a general consensus that changes in mineral magnetic susceptibility parameters predominantly reflect soil forming processes that are in turn influenced by summer monsoon rainfall. In contrast, grain-size variations may be more influenced by winter monsoon circulation, although the precise mechanism remains controversial and are also thought to be affected by source changes. Changes in these climate proxies through loess–palaeosol sequences are widely used as reference points for terrestrial climatic change in global databases and compilations. Furthermore, analysis of mass accumulation rates (MARs) of loess sequences provides insight into changes in past atmospheric dust activity, a critical but poorly understood component of the climate system. An accurate and precise age model is critical to the calculation of MARs and to the proper use of loess monsoon proxies. Many earlier studies used correlation-based methods (i.e. matching of changes in climate proxies or stratigraphy to those in a ‘known age’ sequence), but these have been shown to be inaccurate on millennial timescales during the last glacial and Holocene. However, loess is ideally suited for dating using luminescence methods because of the expected prolonged daylight exposure of sediments before deposition. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating determines the timing of last exposure of certain dosimeter mineral grains to daylight, and so acts as a depositional chronometer. Over recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of studies applying luminescence-based age models to Chinese loess sequences. As a result, considerable progress has been made in understanding loess deposition and the timing of climate change recorded in loess, yet these studies have also raised several questions and discrepancies regarding the use and interpretation of Chinese loess deposits."

With these issues firmly in mind, we present here a detailed investigation of the last-glacial deposits at the important Xifeng (Zhao Jia Chuan) section in the central Chinese Loess Plateau. This study uses quartz OSL ages sampled at 10–20-cm depth resolution, directly measured bulk densities (to calculate MARs), as well as grain-size distributions and magnetic susceptibility (both at 5-cm sampling resolution).

      "challenges": [
        "The luminescence ages show significant pedogenic and anthropogenic disturbance in material deposited after ca. 20–22 ka. Analysis of other published data suggests that this disturbance may be more common than previously realized. Firstly, some studies argue that significant centennial- to millennial-scale gaps in the loess record are present at some sites, of up to 10 ka. Related to this, many sites also show anomalously young luminescence dates at the top of Holocene soils, probably associated with anthropogenic disturbance, and multiple age inversions at the base of Holocene soils, potentially linked to soil-forming processes. These disturbances to the stratigraphic sequence are not always clear from stratigraphy alone. The timing and rate of dust accumulation appears to vary significantly between sites. However, some authors have recently noted an apparent link to the North Atlantic record based on some OSL-dated loess sequences. The presence and nature of this link remains an important question in loess research, yet uncertainties over the nature of loess deposition and alteration, as well as current error uncertainties on luminescence dates, have so far prevented a clear consensus. The fact that questions about these issues can be asked (or in some cases revisited) demonstrates the power of luminescence techniques to address fundamental issues in loess deposition, dust activity and monsoon forcing, to a degree not previously possible. To some extent the differences in findings between studies may reflect real site-to-site differences, but it is also important to note large variations in sampling interval used in studies, varying between 10 cm and >1 m even if only the most detailed studies are considered."

Loess is an aeolian sediment and it is ideal for luminescence dating. Compared with quartz, feldspar is more sensitive to irradiation in producing luminescence, and it has much higher saturation dose. The majority of luminescence dating of Chinese loess have been using feldspars (4–11lm, fine-grain multi-minerals) in order to take the advantage of high saturation dose.

Recent studies have indicated that landscape attributes in the southern TP, such as glaciers, lakes, and vegetation, have changed rapidly over the past 30 years. These landscape changes are closely related to changes in precipitation delivered by the regional atmospheric circulation systems.

        "Sediments on the Chinese Loess Plateau are generally assumed to hold a complete and highly resolved record of late Cenozoic East Asian Monsoon change, a terrestrial equivalent of ocean sediments. Sedimentation is believed to occur almost continuously, with diagenesis having limited impact on preservation of the record. Evidence from loess of rapid climate change has been correlated to North Atlantic millennial-scale oscillations such as Heinrich Events, with age models supporting these reconstructions generally derived through correlation of proxies to the Martinson et al. (1987) marine/H925418O time scale or from derived relationships between sedimentation rate and grain size. Modern patterns of loess deposition suggest that dust storms emanating northwest of the Loess Plateau are responsible for much of the current air fall. This pattern is consistent with a winter monsoon-controlled wind as the transporting agent, although the relative contribution of different source areas complicates interpretations. Recently, however, Kohfeld and Harrison (2003) have highlighted discrepancies between mass accumulation rates calculated using proxy-based and absolute age models. Increasing evidence suggests that loess sedimentation may in fact be episodic, with some sections containing depositional hiatuses and disconformities caused by wind erosion. In addition, Lu et al. (2004) propose that some strata are affected by diagenesis so as to obscure even orbital cycle signals, while Kemp and Derbyshire (1998) indicate many paleosols are accretionary, with multiple horizons ‘‘welded’’ together."

The most valuable palaeoenvironmental archive in this region is its widespread, thick loess deposits. The prevailing wisdom correlates increased loess accumulation with cold glacial phases, and pedogenesis with milder interglacial periods. Researchers concede that the situation for loess generation and deposition in Central Asia may be still more complex due to the close juxtaposition between glaciated high mountains with arid deserts in the basins to the north which act as sediment sinks, and with the piedmont (foothills) in between on which the loess accumulates, transported primarily via westerly or northerly winds. Furthermore, while there is general agreement regarding loess as a homogeneous, silty sediment primarily deposited by wind, precise models for its accumulation across the world remain poorly defined. The close temporal correlation between glacial advances at the heads of catchments and increased loess accumulation downstream supports the classical model for loess formation involving rivers as critical conduits for sediment through basins immediately prior to aeolian transport onto adjacent loess plateaux. It has been hypothesized that the loess deposits of the Central Asian piedmonts result from a more complicated formation mechanism combining all possible options: generation of fine-grained material by glaciers and tectonic weathering in the Tian Shan, as well as by the sand seas in the basins to the north. The relative influence and intensity of the major climate subsystems acting on the region over time—the mid-latitude westerlies, Asian monsoon, and polar front—are also thought to drive the orientation of the dominant wind regimes.

        "Water resources play an important role in the sustainable development of societies in the semiarid and arid regions of Central Asia (approximately 35 e50/C14 N and 50 e110/C14 E) where several climate systems converge, including the Westerlies, the Indian summer monsoon, and the East Asian summer and winter monsoons. The current moisture regime is dominated by the influences of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea via the Westerlies. Changes in past moisture in Central Asia, particularly during the Holocene, are complicated and have been hotly debated in the last few decades. Previous studies have proposed the following three different interpretations of Holocene moisture variations in Central Asia: (1) a humid early Holocene, a moderately humid middle Holocene, and a drier late Holocene, generally in agreement with the Asian summer monsoon-influenced regions; (2) a dry early Holocene, a humid middle Holocene, and a moderately humid late Holocene; and (3) a general wetting trend throughout the Holocene. Most Holocene paleoclimate reconstructions for Central Asia are chiefly based on lacustrine sedimentary deposits, speleothem, ice cores, loess, sand dune deposits, and peat. Similar to the loess deposits in Central China, loess sequences in Central Asia are also believed to record paleoclimatic changes. Loess deposits there are less influenced by human activities and pedogenesis effects, making them reliable for Holocene paleoclimate reconstruction."

Samples for OSL dating were collected at 10-cm intervals by hammering stainless steel cylinders (20 cm length /C2 5c m diameter) into the fresh sections. Quartz OSL dating was conducted at the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The luminescence sample tubes were processed under subdued red-light conditions in the laboratory. The fine-grained (4 e11 mm) quartz was extracted using the pretreatment procedures for loess on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP).

Rainfall carried by the Asian summer monsoon and the Westerlies contributes to the moisture changes in Central Asia. However, considering the dominance of evaporation over rainfall in controlling aridity-humidity shifts in this region, the continuous weakening of evaporation caused by a decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and associated atmospheric temperatures is primarily responsible for the wetting trend throughout the Holocene in the semiarid regions of the Yili Basin."
