            "description": "The dataset is the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) products of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the MSAVI equation which modifies the problem that SAVI is not sensitive in the dense vegetation area.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.MSAVI is stable in the dense vegetation area, but is not sensitive in the sparse vegetation area .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the MSAVI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the MSAVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI;the MSAVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the MSAVI results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the MSAVI results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

The method addresses the insensitivity of the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) in such regions.",

                    "Answer": "The Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) is a vegetation index derived from satellite data, specifically designed to improve the sensitivity of vegetation detection in areas with dense vegetation cover. It is calculated based on surface reflectance data from the Landsat satellite series and serves as an enhancement over the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) by addressing its limitations in densely vegetated regions.",

                    "Answer": "The calculation and accuracy of the MSAVI for the Tibetan Plateau are influenced by the quality of the surface reflectance data derived from the Landsat series satellites. The MSAVI calculation formula improves upon the traditional SAVI by addressing its insensitivity in areas with dense vegetation cover. The dataset includes quality assurance files to identify and account for cloud and snow presence, which can affect data accuracy. The index is stable in densely vegetated areas but less sensitive in sparsely vegetated regions.",

This involves addressing the insensitivity of SAVI in areas with dense vegetation cover and ensuring stability in lush regions while acknowledging limitations in sparsely vegetated areas.",

The MSAVI product is generated by applying the MSAVI calculation formula, which is an improved version of the SAVI. This improvement addresses the insensitivity of SAVI in densely vegetated areas. Additionally, cloud and snow/ice are marked, and a quality assurance file (QA) is produced to ensure data quality.",
