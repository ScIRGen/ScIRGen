                    "Answer": "In the context of desert plant analysis, 'physiological indicators' refer to measurable biological parameters used to assess the physiological state of plants. These include soluble protein content measured in mg/g, free amino acids in µg/g, chlorophyll content in mg/g, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in U/g FW, catalase (CAT) activity in U/(g•min), peroxidase (POD) activity in U/(g•min), proline content in μg/g, soluble sugars in μg/g, and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in μmol/L. These indicators help understand the plant's adaptation mechanisms and stress responses.",

                    "Answer": "In 2011, the physiological analysis was based on samples collected in mid-July from the photosynthetic organs of typical desert plants in the Heihe River Basin, while in 2012, a similar approach was used in mid-July, but the samples were stored in liquid nitrogen tanks and taken back to the laboratory for further measurements. This indicates a potential difference in data preservation and transport techniques between the two years.",
