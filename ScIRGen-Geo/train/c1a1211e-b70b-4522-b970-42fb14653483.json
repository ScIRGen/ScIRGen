            "description": "Zhangye basin mainly includes 20 irrigation areas. Under the restriction of water diversion, the surface water consumption of the irrigation area is under control, but the groundwater exploitation is increased, resulting in the groundwater level drop in the middle reaches, resulting in potential ecological environment risks. Due to the complex and frequent exchange of surface water and groundwater in the study area, it is possible to realize the overall water resource saving by optimizing the utilization ratio of surface water and groundwater in each irrigation area.\nIn this project, on the premise of not changing the water demand of the middle reaches irrigation area, the two problems of maximizing the outflow of Zhengyi Gorge (given groundwater reserve constraint) and maximizing the outflow of Zhengyi Gorge (given groundwater reserve constraint) are studied.",
            "descriptionCn": "张掖盆地主要包括20个灌区，在分水任务的制约下，灌区地表水用量受到控制，但增大了地下水开采，导致中游地下水水位下降，造成潜在的生态环境风险。由于研究区的地表水和地下水存在复杂且频繁的交换，通过优化各灌区地表水和地下水的使用比例，有可能在总体上实现水资源的节约。\n本项目在不改变中游灌区需水量的前提下，研究了最大化正义峡的出流量（给定地下水储量约束）和最大化中游地下水储量（给定正义峡的出流量约束）这两个方面的问题。",

Integrated SW-GW modeling can fuse theoretical knowledge with field observations, and provide a spatially and temporally detailed description of the hydrological cycle in a large basin. A number of integrated SW-GW models have been developed, such as Hydrogeosphere, MIKE-SHE, MODHMS, ParFlow, CATHY, PAWS1CLM, GEOtop, and GSFLOW. The integrated models have been used to address a variety of water and environmental issues, such as impact of climate change, water quality, and basin-scale water resources management."

The proposed approach was applied to optimize the partition of surface water and groundwater in the total irrigation water of ZB’s irrigation districts, such that a better balance between the groundwater storage in the middle HRB and the environmental flow toward the lower HRB can be achieved. In our previous study [Wu et al., 2014], a GSFLOW model was established for the modeling domain (Figure 2a), which adequately simulates the hydrological processes and water budget in the study area.

                "AnswerEn": "The challenges faced when collecting data for large river basin hydrological modeling primarily stem from the difficulty of achieving a comprehensive understanding based solely on field observations. This is particularly challenging for large river basins where surface water and groundwater interactions are complex and frequent, necessitating the use of integrated models to provide detailed descriptions of the hydrological cycle.",

                "AnswerEn": "The data collection methods should focus on understanding the interactions between surface water and groundwater. This can involve integrated modeling techniques that incorporate theoretical knowledge and field observations to describe the hydrological cycle in detail. These methods can include the use of surrogate-based optimization approaches like SOIM, which utilize models such as GSFLOW to simulate hydrological processes and water budgets.",
                "AnswerCn": "数据收集方法应侧重于理解地表水和地下水之间的相互作用。这可以涉及整合建模技术，结合理论知识和实地观察，以详细描述水文循环。这些方法可以包括使用基于替代的优化方法，如SOIM，利用GSFLOW等模型来模拟水文过程和水量预算。",

                "AnswerEn": "One major challenge is achieving a comprehensive understanding based solely on field observations, particularly in large river basins. This is due to the complex and frequent exchanges between surface water and groundwater, which require detailed modeling to accurately represent these interactions. Surrogate-based approaches can help bridge the gap between complex environmental modeling and practical management decision-making.",
                "AnswerCn": "一个主要挑战是仅凭现场观察来实现全面理解，特别是在大型流域中。这是因为地表水和地下水之间复杂且频繁的交换，需要详细的建模来准确表示这些相互作用。基于替代的方法可以帮助弥合复杂环境建模与实际管理决策之间的差距。",
