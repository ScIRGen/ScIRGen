            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the mixed forest station eddy covariance system (EC) in the downstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 29 in 2022. The site (101.1335° E, 41.9903° N) was located in the Sidaoqiao County, in Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region . The elevation is 874 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3.2 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3B & Li7500DS) was 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. The water vapor density data were rejected when the negative values occurred. \nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.\n",

                    "Answer": "The 'eddy covariance technique' refers to a method used to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within the atmosphere. In the context of surface process observation networks, it involves using instruments like ultrasonic anemometers and CO2/H2O analyzers to collect data at high frequencies (e.g., 10Hz) and process it to obtain information such as wind speed, temperature, water vapor, and CO2 fluxes. The technique includes steps like removing outliers, correcting for time delays, rotating coordinates, and applying various corrections to ensure data accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "The need for filtering data with a quality assessment when measuring surface fluxes is due to several factors: ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data by removing values affected by instrument errors, correcting for environmental influences such as rainfall, and excluding data segments with significant gaps or anomalies. This process is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the 30-minute flux values, which undergo tests for atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity to ensure high-quality measurements.",

These processes help ensure that the flux data are accurate and consistent, leading to more dependable results for ecological research. Additionally, quality assessments like atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity tests further contribute to data integrity. However, challenges may arise concerning the selection of proper thresholds for filtering, potential data loss during processing, and the treatment of negative values in certain seasons, such as winter, which might affect the overall data completeness and reliability.",
