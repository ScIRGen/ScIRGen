            "description": "The data are the major and trace data, zircon U-Pb dating data and zircon Lu Hf isotopic data of tonalite porphyrite in tonglingpo, Guichi. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can discuss its genesis and geological background, determine the mineralization time of tonglingpo and the influence of ore bearing quartz diorite porphyrite on copper enrichment, so as to better restrict their relationship with copper mineralization.",

Zircon U-Pb dating and the in situ Lu-Hf isotopic compositions are obtained through LA-MC-ICP-MS. These methods provide reliable data published in high-level SCI journals, which can be used to analyze the genesis and geological background, determine mineralization timing, and assess the influence of quartz diorite porphyry on copper enrichment.",
