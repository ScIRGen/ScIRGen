            "description": "Precipitation stable isotopes (2H and 18O) are adequately understood on their climate controls in the Tibetan Plateau, especially the north of Himalayas via about 30 years’ studies. However, knowledge of controls on precipitation stable isotopes in Nepal (the south of Himalayas), is still far from sufficient.\n This study described the intra-seasonal and annual variations of precipitation stable isotopes at Kathmandu, Nepal from 10 May 2016 to 21 September 2018 and analysed the possible controls on precipitation stable isotopes. All samples are located in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal (27 degrees north latitude, 85 degrees east longitude), with an average altitude of about 1400 m. Combined with the meteorological data from January 1, 2001 to September 21, 2018, the values of precipitation (P), temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) are given.",

                    "Answer": "降水氢氧稳定同位素数据集 refers to datasets that include the stable isotopes of hydrogen (2H) and oxygen (18O) found in precipitation, which are used to understand the climatic controls and variations of precipitation patterns over time. These datasets can reveal the seasonal and annual changes in isotopic composition, providing insights into factors influencing precipitation, such as temperature, humidity, and geographical location.",

The data collected from May 10, 2016, to September 21, 2018, along with meteorological information such as precipitation amount, temperature, and relative humidity, can help identify how these factors influence the isotopic composition of precipitation. This understanding contributes to the broader knowledge of climate controls on precipitation isotopes south of the Himalayas.",

The challenges are compounded by the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the control of precipitation stable isotopes in Nepal, the influence of climatic factors such as precipitation amount, temperature, and relative humidity, and the geographical complexity of the region.",

                    "Answer": "Collecting isotopic data from precipitation over a longer period and in diverse locations around Kathmandu could enhance the understanding of regional climate systems by providing more comprehensive insights into the seasonal and interannual variations in stable isotopes. Such data could help identify the climatic controls on precipitation isotopes more accurately, taking into account variations in precipitation amount, temperature, and relative humidity over time and space. This would likely improve the knowledge of atmospheric processes and water cycle dynamics in the region, particularly regarding the differences between the areas north and south of the Himalayas.",
