            "description": "The data are isotopic dating data, zircon HF-O isotopic data, rock whole rock major and trace data, rock whole rock isotopic geochemical data. The samples were collected from the late Devonian magmatic rocks of Chaka, riwan, Qiangtang, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Radioisotope geochronology data were obtained by analyzing zircon U-Pb isotopes with secondary ion microprobe. HF and O isotopes of minerals were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and secondary ion probe analysis, respectively. The major, trace and isotopic geochemical data of whole rock were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the whole rock isotopic geochemical data were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data obtained can define the early evolution history of the Qiangtang paleoTethys ocean.",

These methods provide precise isotopic dating and compositional analysis, which can reveal insights into the formation processes, source characteristics, and tectonic settings of the igneous rocks studied, thereby offering a clearer picture of the geodynamic history of the area.",

This involves obtaining radiogenic isotopic dating data through secondary ion probe analysis of zircon U-Pb isotopes, as well as mineral Hf and O isotopes using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and secondary ion probe analysis. Whole-rock major and trace elements and isotopic geochemical data are analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.",
