Major elements in the whole rock are analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Trace elements are measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Sr-Nd isotopic data are obtained through multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). For minerals, trace elements are analyzed using laser ablation ICP-MS, while major elements are determined through electron probe microanalysis. This comprehensive approach provides insights into the deep processes of mineral system development.",
