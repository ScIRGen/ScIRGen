Measurements are typically taken around 6:30 AM and 8:00 PM using a balance to weigh the inner tube, along with recording the weather conditions of the day. The data is stored in an Excel spreadsheet. These steps can influence data accuracy by ensuring consistent measurement timing and conditions, although interruptions like irrigation (as noted on June 25 and 26) may affect data continuity and accuracy.",
