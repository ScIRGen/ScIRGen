            "description": "The data set includes radiocarbon dating, carbonized seeds and charcoal identification data. We reassess the chronology of the ancient walled settlement of Sanjiao in the Hexi Corridor in northwestern China through accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS 14C) dating and explore the subsistence of the settlers inside through the identification of carbonized seeds and charcoal. In addition, high-resolution paleoclimate records in the Hexi Corridor and nearby regions are employed to explore the reason for the construction of Sanjiao. Our results show that Sanjiao was built around 828 cal BC and remained inhabited through 384–116 cal BC. This indicates Sanjiao is the earliest known walled settlement in the Hexi Corridor. ",

                    "Answer": "In archaeological research of ancient settlements, such as those in the Hexi Corridor's triangular city, challenges in accurately dating them using radiocarbon dating may arise from various factors. These include the preservation state of organic materials like carbonized seeds and charcoal, contamination of samples, calibration uncertainties in radiocarbon dating results, and the availability of high-resolution paleoclimate records to correlate dating with environmental conditions. These factors can impact the precision and reliability of the dating process, affecting the understanding of settlement timelines and historical significance.",

                    "Answer": "The use of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS 14C) radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification as data collection methods can lead to a more precise understanding of the timeline of ancient settlements, such as establishing that the Triangular Ancient City in the Hexi Corridor was built around 828 BC and inhabited until 384-116 BC. This precision allows researchers to better evaluate the survival strategies of internal settlers by identifying carbonized seeds and charcoal, providing insights into agricultural practices and resource use. Additionally, these methods can help correlate settlement developments with high-resolution paleoclimate records, offering explanations for the construction and habitation of settlements based on environmental conditions.",

                    "Answer": "Radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification methods are crucial for examining historical settlements in the Hexi Corridor because they provide precise chronological information about the construction and habitation periods of ancient sites, such as the triangulated walled settlement. By determining the age of carbonized seeds and charcoal, researchers can better understand the timeline of settlement activities and explore the survival strategies of inhabitants. This approach also allows for the integration of high-resolution paleoclimate records to investigate the reasons behind the construction and sustainability of such settlements, offering insights into the environmental and social dynamics of the region.",
