The observation item was mainly the land surface temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer in the reed plot A, the saline plots B and C, and the alfalfa plot D, the maximum of which were 120m×120m and the minimum were 30m×30m. Data were archived in Excel file.\n    See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",
