            "description": "The Qinghai Tibet Plateau is the largest natural ecological area in China with a natural grassland area, accounting for about one-third of the total grassland area in the country. It is an important animal husbandry base in China and even globally. Grassland is the most important land use vegetation and vegetation type in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. It is not only an important component of the ecological environment of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, but also an important resource foundation for the development of animal husbandry. This data set is based on the 1 ∶ 1000000 grassland resource map of China, which was the first grassland resource survey in China at the end of the 1980s, as the base map, and supplemented by the statistical yearbook of the National Bureau of Statistics and the relevant data of grassland census in Xizang and Qinghai provinces, and updated by the combination of remote sensing interpretation and field survey, to obtain the grid data of the current distribution range of natural grasslands on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and the natural grassland area data of the prefecture level cities under its jurisdiction. The unit of grassland area is square kilometers (km2). It mainly includes the main natural grassland types of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, such as alpine grasslands, alpine meadows, and alpine deserts, which can be used as a base map for estimating grass yield, analyzing the balance of grass and livestock, and studying grassland carrying capacity.",

                    "Answer": "The need arises from the requirement to accurately update the distribution of natural grasslands in the Tibetan Plateau. Remote sensing provides broad, up-to-date coverage, while field surveys validate and refine this data, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This combined method helps in addressing any discrepancies and enhances the depth of the data collected.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating remote sensing interpretation with field surveys for updating natural grassland distribution data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau allows for more accurate and comprehensive datasets. This approach combines the broad spatial coverage and consistent temporal monitoring capabilities of remote sensing with the detailed, ground-truthing insights from field surveys. Consequently, it improves the precision of natural grassland area estimates, which is crucial for analyzing grass production potential, assessing grass-livestock balance, and studying the carrying capacity of these ecosystems.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of using remote sensing interpretation and field surveys for updating natural grassland distribution data are to accurately capture the current distribution and extent of natural grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This is essential for understanding the ecological environment of the plateau, supporting the development of the livestock industry, estimating grass yield, analyzing grass-livestock balance, and studying the carrying capacity of grasslands. These methods help to refine and expand upon earlier data from the 1980s, integrating statistical yearbooks and regional surveys to provide a comprehensive view of grassland resources.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method involves using remote sensing interpretation combined with field surveys to update the distribution range and area of natural grasslands. This process relies on the first national grassland resource survey from the late 1980s, which used a 1:1,000,000 scale China grassland resource map as a base map. It also incorporates statistical yearbooks from the National Bureau of Statistics, along with grassland survey information from the provinces of Tibet and Qinghai, to gather the necessary data.",
