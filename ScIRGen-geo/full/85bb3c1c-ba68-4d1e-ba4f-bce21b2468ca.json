            "description": "Passive microwave radiometers onboard satellites rely on the received upwelling radiation to retrieve precipitation, which is a mixed signal from the surface, atmosphere and precipitation hydrometeors. Liquid precipitation droplets increase the upwelling radiation from the surface at lower frequencies, while ice particles cause a decrease in upwelling radiation at higher frequencies. The task of the retrieval algorithm is to identify the precipitation phase and to isolate the signal of precipitation from that of the surface. This dataset based on a machine learning method to retrieve rainfall and snowfall rates based on observations from the Microwave Hydrometer Sounder and Microwave Temperature Sounder onboard FY-3E. The machine learning method included two parts, Self-organized mapping (SOM) is used to classify the precipitation and underlying surface types, and an artificial neural network (ANN) is subsequently used to relate the brightness temperature to the precipitation rate for the clusters derived from the SOM. The half-hour product of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrieval for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) is used to train the ANN. To address the issue that number of heavy precipitation samples are not enough for training, the simulation of radiative transfer for TOVS is used as a supplement to heavy rain samples. The dataset based on SOM-ANN algorithm outperforms the IMERG and Goddard profiling algorithm (GPROF) retrieval products in both rainfall and snowfall retrieval. Compared with the hourly observations at 4400 stations during a two-year period, the root mean square errors of SOM-ANN proposed here are 1.06 mm/hr and 0.34 mm/hr for the rainfall and snowfall rates, which are better than those of IMERG (1.23 mm/hr and 0.42 mm/hr) and GPROF (1.22 mm/hr and 0.44 mm/hr). The research article about SOM-ANN algorithm and evaluation result are published at  https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JD040731",

The retrieval algorithms must accurately identify the precipitation phase and separate the precipitation signal from the surface signal. Liquid precipitation particles increase the upward radiation at lower frequencies, while ice particles decrease it at higher frequencies. The dataset utilizes machine learning methods, specifically a combination of self-organizing maps (SOM) for classifying precipitation and surface types, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to link brightness temperatures with precipitation rates. These methods are developed to improve retrieval accuracy, as demonstrated by superior performance in comparison to other inversion products.",
