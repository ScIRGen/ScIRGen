            "description": "Paleozoic strata are well developed and widely outcropped around the Xainza area of central Tibet. Among them, the Devonian succession was first introduced during the geological survey in the late 1970s, and was suggested to comprise the Middle Devonian Dardong Group (including the Lower and Upper formations) and the Upper Devonian Chaguoluoma Formation. However, high-resolution stratigraphic framework and palaeontological research are still lacking for the Lower Devonian in study area. This investigation focus on the Dardong Formation in this area, and detailed geological survey and detailed sampling were carried out in order to improve stratigraphic correlation in central Tibet. The Dardong Formation mainly consists of carbonate and siliciclastic sediments, yielding abundant fossils such as brachiopods, corals, cephalopods, conodonts, tentaculites, etc. This dataset includes the stratigraphic column of the SZ1 section and outcrop photos in the Xainza area, central Tibet.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of geological research in the Devonian strata of central Tibet, '生物地层学' refers to biostratigraphy, which is the study of the distribution of fossils within sedimentary rock layers to establish relative ages and correlations between different strata. This approach is used to enhance the precision of stratigraphic comparisons and understand the paleoenvironmental conditions of the region.",

                    "Answer": "The slow progress in paleontological and stratigraphic research of the Devonian system in central Tibet's Shenzha area can be attributed to the lack of a high-precision stratigraphic framework and comprehensive paleontological studies. Initial geological surveys from the 1970s provided a basic understanding of the sequence, but detailed biostratigraphy and chronostratigraphy have been limited, necessitating further geological surveys and systematic sampling to improve the precision of Devonian stratigraphic correlations.",

This could result in the identification of more detailed biostratigraphic zones and improve the accuracy of geological mapping and correlation with other regions. Additionally, it may uncover new fossil assemblages, providing insights into the biodiversity and paleoecology of the Devonian period in this region.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of Devonian strata studies in the Shenzha area of Tibet, conducting a detailed geological survey and systematic sampling involves several steps. Initially, field geologists perform a thorough examination of the stratigraphic sections, such as the Daldong Formation, to understand the composition and distribution of carbonate and clastic rocks. This includes identifying fossil content like brachiopods, corals, cephalopods, conodonts, and crinoids. Detailed mapping and logging of stratigraphic columns are carried out, accompanied by the collection of rock and fossil samples. These samples are then used for biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic analyses to enhance the precision of stratigraphic correlations within the region.",
