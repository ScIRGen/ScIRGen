            "description": "Glacier thickness variation is an important parameter for glacier monitoring. KH-9 stereo image pairs (1975) and ZY-3 stereo image pairs (2015, 2017 and 2021) were used to generate multi-temporal digital elevation models of the Puruogangri Ice Field based on optical photogrammetry. Besides, SRTM DEM data products (2000) and Copernicus DEM data products (2012) were used to quantify the interdecadal and multi-year scale thickness variation datasets of the Puruogangri Ice Field during 1975-2021. The area change from 1975 to 2021 was estimated based on the Band Ratio method using high-resolution satellite images. The dataset, with a spatial resolution of 15m, can be further used for glacier and hydrological model parameter estimation and model validation, and analysis of glacier future evolution.",
            "instructions": "The data files include 6 glacier area files and 7 thickness variation files, respectively. The glacier area files are named as follows: puruogangri_Boundary_xxxx_UTM45, xxxx indicates the specific year; the glacier thickness variation files are named as follows: dh_xxxx_xxxx, where dh indicates the glacier thickness change, the first xxxx indicates the start year of the study period, and the second xxxx indicates the end year of the study period. The first xxxx indicates the start year of the study period, and the second xxxx indicates the end year of the study period. The file formats are SHAPE (*.shp) and GeoTIFF (*.tif), which can be read directly by ArcMap, MATLAB, and other tools.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of ice sheet monitoring and data collection, '光学摄影测量技术' (optical photogrammetry technology) refers to a method that uses stereo image pairs from sources like KH-9 and ZY-3 to create digital elevation models (DEMs) of ice sheets over multiple time periods. This technology enables researchers to measure changes in glacier surface elevation and mass balance by analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery over time.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using KH-9 stereo pairs (from 1975) and ZY-3 stereo pairs (from 2015, 2017, and 2021) both employ optical photogrammetry techniques to extract digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Puruogangri ice field. The KH-9 stereo pairs are part of historical imaging systems, while ZY-3 is a more modern satellite, potentially offering improvements in spatial resolution and accuracy. The ZY-3 data is complemented by SRTM DEM (2000) and Copernicus DEM (2012) data products, which help quantify glacier surface elevation and mass balance changes over time. The spatial resolution achieved is 15m, which supports detailed analysis for glacier and hydrological modeling and validation.",

                    "Answer": "Using these data sources and methods allows for a comprehensive analysis of glacier surface elevation and mass balance changes over time, offering detailed insights into the inter-decadal and multi-decadal dynamics of glacier changes from 1975 to 2021. This approach can improve the accuracy of glacier and hydrological model parameter estimation and validation, and enhance understanding of future glacier evolution.",
