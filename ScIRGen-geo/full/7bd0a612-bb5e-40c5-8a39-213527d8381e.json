            "description": "This dataset is the spatial distribution map of the marshes in the source area of the Yellow River near the Zaling Lake-Eling Lake, covering an area of about 21,000 square kilometers. The data set is classified by the Landsat 8 image through an expert decision tree and corrected by manual visual interpretation. The spatial resolution of the image is 30m, using the WGS 1984 UTM projected coordinate system, and the data format is grid format. The image is divided into five types of land, the land type 1 is “water body”, the land type 2 is “high-cover vegetation”, the land type 3 is “naked land”, and the land type 4 is “low-cover vegetation”, and the land type 5 is For \"marsh\", low-coverage vegetation and high-coverage vegetation are distinguished by vegetation coverage. The threshold is 0.1 to 0.4 for low-cover vegetation and 0.4 to 1 for high-cover vegetation.",
            "instructions": "The dataset files are uniformly packaged in the “result” folder, and the “resultgrid” grid format file can be opened using ArcGis software to view the classification results of the Yellow River source marsh. You can use the ArcGis Import Symbology feature to import a preset layer by opening the \"resultgrid.lyr\" layer file.",

This data helps in understanding the glacier coverage and changes over specific time periods, like those observed in the 2003-2004 period for regions in Pakistan.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of Landsat remote sensing data for glacier cataloging in Pakistan during 2003-2004 was influenced by its capability to provide comprehensive and accurate imagery of the region, enabling the identification of glacier attributes such as location, area, and orientation. Additionally, the support from organizations like the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the United Nations Environment Programme/Regional Resource Centre, Asia and The Pacific (UNEP/RRC-AP) likely facilitated this choice, as these agencies may have recognized the value of Landsat data for environmental monitoring and research.",
