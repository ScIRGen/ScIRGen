            "description": "Frozen soils refer to various rocks and soils containing ice crystals at low temperatures of 0 oC or below 0 oC. Seasonal frozen soil and permafrost widely distributed across China. Land surface freeze/thaw (F/T) transformation affects the surface water cycle, energy cycle, carbon cycle and carbon and nitrogen gas release at permafrost region, and is closely related to global climate change. This dataset was obtained by combining Ka-band, which is sensitive to surface temperature, and X-band, which is sensitive to soil moisture, to develop a pixel wise land surface freeze/thaw detection algorithm to produce land surface freeze/thaw data over China from 2011 to 2021 based on FY-3B/MWRI and FY-3D/MWRI data. This dataset includes daily land surface freeze/thaw state data for mainland China at 0.25 degree (~25 km) spatial resolution. This dataset has the highest accuracy compared to the major internationally published freeze/thaw data products (AMSR2, SMAP and MEaSUREs). The overall accuracy of the dataset was verified to be above 85.5% using in situ 5 cm soil temperature data distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, and the accuracy of the dataset was verified to be above 90% using in situ 5 cm soil temperature data distributed in Northeast and North China.\n\n",

Global warming causes permafrost thawing, which increases carbon emissions and in turn exacerbates climate change. Passive microwave remote sensing has been proven to be effective in monitoring land surface F/T. In recent years, permafrost has begun to thaw and refreeze due to climate change. Seasonal F/T over permafrost areas is an indicator of climate change. The hydrothermal variation caused by the seasonal F/T cycle over the QTP is an important factor affecting the climate in East Asia. Remotely sensed satellite data are efficient at detecting land surface F/T states at global and regional scales. Satellite microwave remote sensing, especially at low frequency, is well-suited for soil F/T detection because of the high contrast in permittivity between liquid water and ice. Existing F/T detection algorithms did not perform well in the QTP, which has a variety of climate types and complex terrains."

However, the accuracy is influenced by snowmelt and appears to be overestimated for thaw soil during the day. However, at present, the major drawback of DFA is that the algorithm development relies on in situ or model simulated data, and DFA with fixed coefficients was used to classify surface F/T over global regions."

The FY-3B/MWRI data and ERA5-land dataset were used to develop the algorithm. The in situ data were used to evaluate the accuracies of F/T detection flags by satellite data. FY-3B and FY-3D carried with MWRI provide continuous global, twice-daily Tb measurements from November 2010 to July 2019 and from November 2017 to the present, respectively. The recalibrated FY-3B/D microwave data have higher accuracy and consistency, compared with the original L1 microwave data in the operational system of the National Satellite Meteorological Center. The SMAP L3 F/T product provided twice-daily land surface F/T flags retrieved by the SMAP L-band Tb from 6:00 and 18:00 overpass orbits.

Additionally, the spatial distribution of frozen days over the QTP of 2018 based on the new algorithm has good consistency with the permafrost map. This algorithm performs well in QTP areas with complex topography and climate types and holds the promise of providing users with highly accurate F/T products on larger and even global scales."
