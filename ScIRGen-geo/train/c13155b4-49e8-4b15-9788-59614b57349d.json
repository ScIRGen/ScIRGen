            "description": "Soil moisture is a critical component of regional and global water cycles, playing important roles in various ecological, hydrological, and atmospheric processes. Accurate global soil moisture monitoring is crucial for deepening our understanding of these processes and providing information for weather and climate prediction, agricultural drought monitoring, water resource management, and global climate change research. This study integrated satellite data from multiple passive microwave sensors to overcome the lack of temporal and spatial consistency in traditional soil moisture monitoring. By combining multi frequency brightness temperature data from tilt orbit satellites (TMI and GMI) and polar orbit satellites (AMSR-E and AMSR2) that have been mutually calibrated, the soil moisture data of SMAP accurately extracted using multi-channel collaborative retrieval algorithm (MCCA) was selected as the target. The LSTM machine learning model was successfully used to generate four global soil moisture products: TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR2, and GMI. After verification, these four data have broad consistency worldwide. Therefore, these datasets were merged to create a daily scale soil moisture integrated product (MCCA-ML) with a resolution of 25 KM from 1997 to 2023. The soil moisture inversion results of the MCCA-ML soil moisture dataset inherit the advantages of the MCCA SMAP data, including the soil moisture content during the melting period and the liquid water content during the freezing period. Through validation with 24 global ground-based dense observation networks and other datasets (MCCA SMAP and ESA CCI), MCCA-ML is highly consistent with global climate and geographic features in terms of spatial distribution and seasonal variation patterns. This dataset performs better overall than traditional data products on 24 dense observation networks. During the multi satellite collaborative service period, the global land coverage of MCCA-ML exceeded 80%, significantly better than existing products, effectively enhancing the global daily scale soil moisture monitoring capability.",

It enhances global soil moisture monitoring by integrating satellite data from multiple passive microwave sensors, such as TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR2, and GMI. By utilizing a multi-channel collaborative retrieval algorithm (MCCA) and LSTM machine learning models, it overcomes temporal and spatial inconsistencies in traditional soil moisture monitoring methods. The dataset exhibits high consistency with global climate and geographical features and provides improved global land coverage, especially during the multi-satellite collaborative service period, thus significantly enhancing global daily-scale soil moisture monitoring capabilities.",
