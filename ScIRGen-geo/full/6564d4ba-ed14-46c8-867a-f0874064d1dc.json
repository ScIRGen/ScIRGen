            "description": "This dataset contains monthly land surface evapotranspiration products in Qilian Mountain area every 5 years from 1985 to 2015. It has 0.05 degree spatial resolution from 1985 to 1995 and 0.01 degree spatial resolution from 2000 to 2015. The dataset was produced based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method by fusing six satellite-derived evapotranspiration products including RS-PM (Mu et al., 2011), SW (Shuttleworth and Wallace., 1985), PT-JPL (Fisher et al., 2008), MS-PT (Yao et al., 2013), SEMI-PM (Wang et al., 2010a) and SIM (Wang et al.2008). The input variables for the evapotranspiration products include MODIS products, GIMMS AVHRR NDVI and China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (He Jie, Yang Kun. China Meteorological Forcing Dataset. Cold and Arid Regions Science Data Center at Lanzhou, 2011. doi:10.3972/westdc.002.2014.db).",

This approach likely offers improved accuracy and reliability by leveraging the strengths of each individual product and reducing the uncertainties associated with each method. The use of GPR provides a systematic framework for integrating diverse data sources and may offer advantages over simpler averaging or weighting methods by better accounting for the spatial and temporal variability inherent in evapotranspiration processes. The resulting datasets, with varying resolutions over different periods, reflect the advancements in remote sensing and data integration techniques and their application to regional climate and hydrological modeling.",

These products include RS-PM, SW, PT-JPL, MS-PT, SEMI-PM, and SIM. The temporal resolution changes from 0.05° for 1985-1995 to 0.01° for 2000-2015, which might affect the accuracy due to differences in spatial resolution and the characteristics of the underlying remote sensing products like MODIS and AVHRR NDVI.",
