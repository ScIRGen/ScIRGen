                "The northeastern (NE) Tibetan Plateau comprises the Songpan‐Ganzi terrane (SPGZ), the Qaidam‐Kunlun‐West Qinling terrane (QKW), and the Qilian terrane (QL), which are divided by the Kunlun fault (KLF), the South Qilian suture (SQS)‐West Qinling fault (WQL), and the North Qilian fault (NQF)‐Haiyuan fault (HY)‐Liupanshan fault (LPS), respectively. Changes in locations, ages, and styles of fault deformation suggest that the rate of deformation of the NE Tibetan Plateau has accelerated and that the orientation of crustal shortening has changed from NNE‐SSW to NE‐SW or ENE‐WSW since 20–15 Ma. Seismic reflection analysis, combined with other structural studies, reveals that the region of the NE Tibetan Plateau between the Kunlun fault and the Hexi Corridor (HC) has absorbed more than 250–350 km of Cenozoic N‐S shortening. These structural features indicate that the NE Tibetan Plateau is located at the leading edge of the northeastward expansion of the Tibetan Plateau, driven by continuous convergence following the collision of India and Eurasia. However, the modes of lithospheric deformation and their connections to the northeastern expansion and growth of the NE Tibetan Plateau remain unresolved. The southward subduction of the Asian lithospheric mantle, acting in multiple stages with inclined interfaces or over a long distance at a shallow angle, has been proposed to address the growth of the NE Tibetan Plateau. However, several recent findings indicate that the Asian lithospheric mantle does not subduct beneath the NE Tibetan Plateau. Furthermore, seismic anisotropy observations agree well with the model of the vertically coherent deformation between the crust and lithospheric mantle of the NE Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, whether southward subduction of the Asian Plate is occurring beneath the NE Tibetan Plateau is still disputed. In contrast, an asthenospheric flow model has been proposed, arguing that asthenospheric materials flow eastward through a low‐velocity zone at depths of 125–200 km beneath the WQO."

            "methods": [
                "The calculation of the S‐RFs mainly includes coordinate rotation and deconvolution. The three‐component seismograms (Z‐N‐E) are rotated to the local ray coordinate system (P‐SV‐SH) using the back azimuth of and incidence angle. The P component is deconvolved from the SV component to generate the S‐RF. After deconvolution, the obtained S‐RF is normalized to the maximum amplitude of the spike on the SV component. We also reverse the time axis and amplitudes of the S‐RF to compare with those of the P‐RF. To further intuitively depict the lateral variations in the lithospheric structure, we need to construct depth sections using a common conversion point (CCP) stacking approach. In this method, each cross section is divided into grids, and each grid has a 2‐km horizontal step and a 2‐km vertical step. The Sp amplitudes of each S‐RF are backprojected to their spatial locations where conversions occur along the incoming raypath. The amplitudes of all grids that are perpendicular to the profile within a width of 150 km are stacked along the designed profile to form the depth‐migrated section. Finally, we apply the horizontal stacking within one Fresnel zone to generate a smoothed image for further tectonic analysis. The S‐RFs for all the stations are obtained according to the methodology described above. We manually pick the high‐quality S‐RFs at each station using the following criteria: (1) We removed S‐RFs with unexpectedly large amplitudes or periodical oscillations compared with the stacked trace of all the S‐RFs and (2) we selected S‐RFs with clear Moho Sp phases appearing within ±1.5 s around the Moho Ps arrival time computed by the available crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio. Before further analysis, the retained S‐RFs are filtered with a low‐pass filter of 3 s. For both stations, we stack the moveout‐corrected S‐RFs (with a reference slowness of 6.4 s per degree) and estimate the uncertainties of the stack traces using bootstrapping analysis. We repeat 500 bootstrap realizations, which are performed by stacking the same number of S‐RFs that are randomly selected from the original S‐RFs, and then compute two standard deviations (2σ) to determine the typical values of the uncertainties in the sum trace at each station."

The most prominent variation in the LAB depth is the presence of LAB steps of no less than 20 km in the transition zone between the active NE Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding cratonic Alxa and Ordos blocks, which conflicts with the model of southward subduction of the Alxa and Ordos blocks. Therefore, we propose that these scenarios of LAB can be attributed to the delamination of fragmented mantle lithosphere in the transition zone between the NE Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding Alxa and Ordos blocks, triggered by lateral asthenospheric flow."

                    "Answer": "The calculation of the S-wave receiver functions mainly includes coordinate rotation and deconvolution. The three-component seismograms (Z-N-E) are rotated to the local ray coordinate system (P-SV-SH) using the back azimuth and incidence angle. The P component is deconvolved from the SV component to generate the S-RF, which is then normalized to the maximum amplitude of the spike on the SV component.

                    "Answer": "In the CCP stacking approach, each cross section is divided into grids with a 2-km horizontal and vertical step. The Sp amplitudes of each S-RF are backprojected to their spatial locations where conversions occur along the incoming raypath. The amplitudes of all grids perpendicular to the profile within a width of 150 km are stacked along the designed profile to form the depth-migrated section, followed by horizontal stacking within one Fresnel zone to generate a smoothed image for tectonic analysis.",

S-RFs with clear Moho Sp phases appearing within ±1.5 s around the Moho Ps arrival time were selected. A low-pass filter of 3 s was applied, and moveout-corrected S-RFs were stacked with a reference slowness of 6.4 s per degree. Uncertainties of the stack traces were estimated using bootstrapping analysis, involving 500 bootstrap realizations, to determine typical values of uncertainties.",
