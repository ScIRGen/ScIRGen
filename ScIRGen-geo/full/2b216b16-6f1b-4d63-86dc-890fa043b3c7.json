                "Tropical cyclone precipitation (TCP), accounting for some of the most extreme rainfall events, can lead to severe flooding and landslides, which often occur together as compound natural hazards during a tropical cyclone landfall. As one of the costliest and deadliest natural disasters, tropical cyclones (TCs) pose a high risk for global coastal regions. On average, nine tropical cyclones make landfall in China each year, bringing strong winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall leading to severe property damages and loss of lives. Supertyphoon Haiyan, which made landfall in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Southeast China in November 2013, is one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded in the region, causing 6000 fatalities and estimated damages of USD 4.55 billion (in 2013 values) resulting from a combination of rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind damages. From 1985 to 2002, an average of 483 deaths were caused by typhoons each year, and a total of 490,000 houses collapsed resulting in direct economic losses of CNY 34.7 billion (in 2000 values). These damages have been increasing in recent years over China; Chen et al. (2018) found a statistically significant increasing trend in the inflation-adjusted losses associated with tropical cyclones from 1983 to 2015. Tropical cyclone precipitation (TCP) plays an important role in TC-related damages. TCP can cause flooding and landslides and could lead to compounding impacts on coastal communities already affected by storm surge and strong winds."

We also built two new binary datasets, Z1 and Z50, to identify stations that have exceeded precipitation thresholds of 1 and 50 mm for that day, respectively. The TC tracks are taken from the western North Pacific best-track dataset from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. We use the maximum sustained wind speed at each time step to classify the TC based on the TC descriptions from JTWC. We employ a moving neighborhood and semivariogram framework to analyze TCP spatial extent and intensity under the different point-LMI categories. We calculate the distribution of TCP for the 1951–2019 period in two ways. For the trend calculation at each station, we use the linear regression model function in R to calculate the regression coefficient, and we also use the Mann–Kendall trend test to check whether the trend is statistically significant."

The total TCP amount estimated using the varying spatial extent helps to determine more accurately the amount of seasonal rainfall that is from tropical cyclones in China. We also determined the rainfall trend from 1951 to 2019 for TCP and found that when compared with the inland stations the historical TCP rainfall trend in those stations near the coastline of China is significantly increasing. We found that the largest areas and heaviest intensities of rainfall occur when a supertyphoon has weakened to a tropical storm at landfall. When considering all tropical cyclones and their rainfall contribution to rainfall over land stations, we found that tropical cyclone rainfall has become heavier in most coastal areas of China."

                    "Answer": "The findings indicate that historical tropical cyclone precipitation (TCP) rainfall trends near the coastline of China are significantly increasing compared to inland stations. This suggests regional variations, potentially due to the interaction of cyclones with the coastal geography, leading to differences in rainfall intensity and spatial extent.",
