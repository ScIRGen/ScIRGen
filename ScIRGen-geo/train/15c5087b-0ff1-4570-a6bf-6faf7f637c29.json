            "description": "The table mainly describes the characteristics of granodiorite (porphyry) samples in Chizhou area. The table elements include rock mass name, sampling location, rock type, structure, main minerals, related deposit age research methods, rock age data and other related data. Based on the summary of previous studies, LA-ICP-MS, Sims, shrimp and other methods are used to study the age of related rocks. The age of granodiorite (porphyry) samples in Chizhou area is 139.6 ± 2.1 to 149.4 ± 2. The main mineral composition of the rock is 20-30% quartz, 20-25% potash feldspar, 35-40% plagioclase, 10% biotite and 5% amphibole.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored in Excel.",
