            "description": "Apparent temperature refers to the degree of heat and cold that the human body feels, which is affected by temperature, wind speed and humidity. The spatial scope of the data covers 34 key nodes in the pan-third pole region (Vientiane, Yangon, Kolkata, Warsaw, Karachi, Yekaterinburg, Chittagong, Tashkent, etc.). The spatial resolution is 100m, and the temporal resolution is year.\nProcessing process: Based on the monitoring data of the meteorological station, calculate the apperant temperature based on the Humidex index, and then use the temperature correction method based on elevation correction to obtain 1km gridded data of the entire area, and downscale it to 100m. The heat wave risk dataset mainly uses intensity as the evaluation index. The spatial range and spatial resolution are consistent with the somatosensory temperature data set, and the temporal resolution is years. \nThe criterion for judging the heat wave is: the weather process in which the somatosensory temperature exceeds 29℃ for three consecutive days is judged to be a high-temperature heat wave.",

                "Heatwaves are generally defined as prolonged periods of high temperature and excess heat with significant impacts on humans and natural ecosystems. In recent decades, heatwaves have become one of the deadliest natural hazards in some regions, and are recognized as \"silent killers.\" Heatwaves leave marked societal impacts ranging from damaging infrastructure, stressing emergency response units and hospitals, and overburdening the electricity grids, to paralyzing the railroad and air transportation systems. A comprehensive analysis of heatwaves should consider four key characteristics of such events, namely: 1. intensity, 2. duration, 3. frequency, and 4. spatial extent. Heatwave and warm-spell identification methodologies in this data set include five general categories: 1. constant temperature threshold approach, 2. location and calendar day specific temperature threshold (PDF-derived threshold approach), 3. location specific threshold based on upper tail of summer temperature distribution (summer-derived threshold approach), 4. excess heat factor (EHF) approach, and 5. the herein introduced standardized heat index (SHI) method. Existing heatwave datasets mainly focus on fixed-threshold definitions emanated from community efforts such as the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). However, over a relatively short period of time, significant strides have been made in characterizing heatwaves and understanding their impacts, some of which call for or propose localized and sector-specific thresholds for identifying heatwaves."
