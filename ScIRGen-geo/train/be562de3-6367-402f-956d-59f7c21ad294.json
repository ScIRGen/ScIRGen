The dataset was produced based on ISCCP-HXG cloud products, ERA5 reanalysis data, and MODIS aerosol and albedo products with an improved physical parameterization scheme. Validation and comparisons with other global satellite radiation products indicate that our SSR estimates were generally better than those of the ISCCP flux dataset (ISCCP-FD), the global energy and water cycle experiment surface radiation budget (GEWEX-SRB), and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). This SSR dataset will contribute to the land-surface process simulations and the photovoltaic applications in the future. The unit is W/㎡, instantaneous value.",

                "Surface solar radiation (SSR), which drives the energy, water and carbon cycles of Earth’s system, is the driving input for simulations of hydrology, ecology, agriculture and land-surface processes. The accuracy of SSR data influences simulations of runoff, gross primary productivity, growth and yield of crops, and land data assimilation. SSR is also an important variable that affects the speed of glacier melting. Variations of SSR also affect the rate of global warming and the change of pan evaporation. Information on the spatiotemporal distribution of SSR is fundamental for the selection of sites for solar power plants, decisions on energy policy, optimization of solar power systems and operations management. Measurement by the accurately calibrated and well-maintained radiometer of pyranometer is the most effective method to obtain reliable long-term SSR data. Although these data are valuable for simulations of land surface processes, solar power applications and evaluation of satellite retrievals, the high cost of maintaining radiation radiometers means that networks of radiation stations are too sparsely distributed. However, networks of routine meteorological stations are denser than those of radiation stations, and the variables observed at routine meteorological stations can be used to estimate SSR."

When the estimated instantaneous SSR data were up-scaled to 90 km, its error was clearly reduced, with RMSE decreasing to 93.4 W m−2 and R increasing to 0.95.
