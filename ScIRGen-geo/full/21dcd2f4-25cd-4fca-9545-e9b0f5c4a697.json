            "description": "The data set contains the flux observation data of scintillator with large aperture from sidaoqiao station downstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network.A large aperture scintillator of BLS900 type is installed in the downstream. The north tower is the receiving end and the south tower is the transmitting end.The observation time is from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.The site is located in ejin banner, Inner Mongolia, with tamarix chinensis, populus populus, bare land and cultivated land under it.The latitude and longitude of the north tower is 101.137e, 42.008n, and the latitude and longitude of the south tower is 101.131e, 41.987 N, with an elevation of about 873m.The effective height of the large aperture scintillator is 25.5m, the optical diameter length is 2350m and the sampling frequency is 1min.\nLarge aperture flicker meter raw observation data for 1 min, data released for after processing and quality control of data, including sensible heat flux is mainly combined with the automatic meteorological station observation data, based on similarity theory alonzo mourning - Mr. Hoff is obtained by iterative calculation, the quality control of the main steps include: (1) excluding Cn2 reach saturation data (e-14 Cn2 > 7.58);(2) data with weak demodulation signal strength (Average X Intensity<1000) were eliminated;(3) data at the time of precipitation were excluded;(4) data of weak turbulence under stable conditions were excluded (u* < 0.1m/s).During the iterative calculation, the stability universal function of Thiermann and Grassl(1992) was selected.Please refer to Liu et al(2011, 2013) for detailed introduction.From June 8 to 16, 2016, the measurement signal of large aperture scintillator was relatively small, resulting in a large number of missing data.\nA few notes on published data :(1) data missing time is marked by -6999.(2) data table head: Date/Time: Date/Time (format: yyyy/m/d h:mm), Cn2: structural parameters of air refraction index (unit: m-2/3), H_LAS: sensible heat flux (unit: W/m2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al. (2011) for observation data processing.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

One-source models cannot accurately estimate surface evapotranspiration due to this heterogeneity. The TSEB model, for example, shows that errors in determining surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the composite radiometric temperature can significantly affect model performance.",

The HiWATER experiment addresses these challenges by using a combination of intensive observation periods and continuous measurements across different landscapes. However, the limited availability of multiscale data and the complexity of capturing interactions between oases and deserts remain significant challenges.
