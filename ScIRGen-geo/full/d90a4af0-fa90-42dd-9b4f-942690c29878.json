            "description": "Through the joint inversion of seismic waveforms and InSAR coseismic displacement data, our study revealed the spatiotemporal and spatial source rupture processprocesses of the two strong earthquakes that occurred in struck the eastern Tibetan Plateau atin May 2021. The results show that the Yangbi earthquake, which occurred in along the southeastern margin of the TibetTibetan Plateau, was a Mw6.1 event with characterized by unilateral right-dextral strike-slip rupture and 8s an 8 s duration. The In addition, the Maduo earthquake, which occurred in the interior of the Tibetan Plateau, was a Mw7.5 event with characterized by left-sinistral lateral-strike- slip extendedextending along both sides of the earthquake seismogenic fault and 36sa 36 s duration. The rupture properties of these two strong earthquakes reflect the deformation characteristics of different parts of the eastern Tibetan Plateau,. and also These events also caused the increase of the Coulomb stress of the surrounding active faults to increase, so we should pay attention to the risk potential of future earthquakes should be evaluated.",

                    "Answer": "InSAR, or Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, is a remote sensing technique used to detect ground displacement by comparing radar images of the Earth's surface taken at different times. In the context of understanding earthquake source processes, InSAR provides spatial observations of coseismic displacement, which can be used in conjunction with seismic records to model the rupture process of earthquakes, such as the Mw6.1 Yangbi and Mw7.5 Maduo earthquakes on the Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Seismic records and InSAR data collection methods used to study the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau reveal the ongoing and frequent tectonic movements and seismic activities due to the collision between the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate. Specifically, the data indicates that the Yangbi earthquake, with right-lateral strike-slip rupture, occurred at the southeastern edge of the plateau, while the Maduo earthquake, with left-lateral strike-slip rupture, happened within the plateau, showing different deformation characteristics across various parts of the region. These events also increased Coulomb stress on surrounding active faults, providing insights into the deformation patterns and aiding in seismic hazard assessments.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of data collection methods was influenced by the need to accurately capture the rupture processes of the earthquakes. The use of seismic records and space-based geodetic displacement data (InSAR) was crucial in understanding the distinct rupture characteristics of each earthquake. The Maduo earthquake involved left-lateral strike-slip rupture that extended bilaterally with supershear phenomena, while the Yangbi earthquake involved right-lateral strike-slip rupture with unilateral rupture characteristics. These methods allowed researchers to model these processes effectively and revealed deformation characteristics and stress changes in surrounding fault systems, providing key insights into the tectonic movements of the Tibetan Plateau.",
