            "description": "The problem of dolomite has always been concerned by sedimentology. However, it is still impossible to form low-temperature primary dolomite without catalyst in the laboratory, so the kinetic mechanism of dolomite formation has been in doubt. Microbial induction can effectively promote the formation of primary dolomite, but its control mechanism is still unclear. At the same time, a large number of examples of microbial induction of primary dolomite are concentrated in the modern environment and laboratory conditions, and the relevant reports on deep strata are very limited. In this study, the stratiform dolostones in the late Miocene Niubao formation obtained from well Wang 1 in Lunpola Basin, central Qinghai Tibet Plateau, are taken as the research objects. The petrographic characteristics of stratiform dolostones are derived from thin section observation, the characteristics of ancient water body are derived from stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis, and the micro scale morphology of dolostones, The spatial distribution of the minerals was observed by SEM and TEM. Mineralogical, diagenetic and isotopic analyses indicate that dolomite is a primary deposit, thus retaining a large number of original sedimentary features. The oxygen isotope values of dolomite ranged from - 3.2 to - 1.76 ‰ and the carbon isotope values ranged from - 2.62 to - 3.78 ‰. The average oxygen isotope values of reconstructed paleowaters were - 3.87 ‰, indicating that dolomite was formed in a strong evaporation environment. Laminar dolomite is composed of organic rich layer and silicate clastic layer. The dolomite is characterized by nanospheres with a diameter of about 80-100nm. In space, it can be seen that it is specifically adsorbed on the surface of organic matter film and flaky clay minerals, and has obvious characteristics of aggregation and morphological growth. This may indicate that organic matter film and flaky clay mineral surface can promote the formation of low-temperature dolomite, which is basically consistent with the results observed in the laboratory. It provides a detailed research case for revealing the formation process of primary dolomite at deep time.",

                    "Answer": "Microbial-induced primary dolomite formation refers to the process by which microbes facilitate the formation of primary dolomite minerals. In sedimentology, this process is significant as it provides a potential mechanism for dolomite formation in conditions where traditional low-temperature dolomite formation is not feasible due to the absence of a catalyst. The research suggests that microbial activity can promote dolomite formation, particularly in environments where organic material and clay minerals are present, as seen in the laminae structure of the studied dolomite.",

                    "Answer": "Thin section observation provides a basic understanding of the petrographic characteristics at a macroscopic level, allowing for the identification of the lamellar dolostone's lithofacies. In contrast, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offer more detailed insights at the micro-scale, revealing the specific morphology of dolomite as nano-sized spherical particles and their spatial distribution, which includes their adsorption on organic films and clay minerals. These advanced imaging techniques help identify aggregation patterns and morphological growth features not visible through thin section observation.",

The laminar dolostone comprises alternating organic-rich layers and silicate detrital layers, with dolomite exhibiting nanosphere characteristics of about 80-100 nm in diameter. This spatial distribution and morphological growth on organic films and clay minerals imply that these surfaces may facilitate low-temperature dolomite formation, aligning with laboratory observations. This provides a detailed case study for understanding the primary dolomite formation process over geological timescales.",
