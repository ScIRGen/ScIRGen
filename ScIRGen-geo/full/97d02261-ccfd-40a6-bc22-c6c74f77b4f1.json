            "description": "1) The data content is the exposure age of the Cosmogenic Nuclide 10Be of the moraine left by the glaciers around the Muztagh Ata peak in the Holocene, including the sampling location, 10Be concentration, calculation results, etc. 2) 10Be concentration data are from published literature. Referring to the latest 10Be yield in the world, three different yield correction methods are used to calculate the exposure age of moraine samples. 3) Compared with the chronological data of the original published literature, this data is more accurate, and the chronological results given by the three methods can be compared with each other, with better concentration within the error range. 4) The data can be used to understand the Holocene change law of glaciers in Pamir region and provide data support for chronological comparison of glacial evolution in the northwest of the plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Using multiple 10Be production rate calibration methods can enhance the precision and reliability of exposure age dating for glacial moraines by providing results that can be cross-verified across different methods. This approach leads to more accurate and precise age estimates compared to using a single method, as the concentration of results within the error range is improved. Consequently, this allows for a better understanding of Holocene glacier changes in the Pamir region and provides robust chronological data for comparing glacier evolution in the northwestern part of the plateau.",
