            "description": "The data set mainly includes the non-traditional B-Mo isotopic data of zhengga granite in Luobusa Town, qusong County, Shannan City, southern Tibet and Sailipu potassic rock in yare Township, Geji County, Ali Region. The data is mainly used to study the B-Mo isotopic fractionation mechanism during magmatic evolution and the recycling of crustal materials in the Indian Continent, which is of great significance for tracing the genesis of magmatic rocks and the crust mantle reaction in the collision zone. The rocks mainly come from granite and potassic rocks in SANGRI and Sailipu areas in southern Tibet. Among them, there are 19 Mo test samples and 24 B test samples, excluding repeated sample testing. MC-ICP-MS is used for B-Mo isotope analysis, and ICP-AES and MC-ICP-MS are used for B and Mo contents of solution respectively. The testing unit is Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data comes from the articles not received, and the data is true and reliable. It can be applied to the study of unconventional isotope fractionation and the genesis of magmatic rocks.",

                    "Answer": "B-Mo isotopic fractionation refers to the process of differentiation or variation in the isotopic composition of boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo) during magmatic evolution. This involves studying how the isotopes of these elements separate or fractionate in different geological settings, which can provide insights into the mechanisms of magmatic evolution, the recycling of continental crust materials, and the genesis of magmatic rocks. The data are typically collected using techniques like multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) to analyze the isotopic ratios and concentrations of B and Mo in rock samples.",

Additionally, the complex geological setting and the need to differentiate between magmatic evolution and crustal material recycling could pose difficulties in data collection and interpretation.",
