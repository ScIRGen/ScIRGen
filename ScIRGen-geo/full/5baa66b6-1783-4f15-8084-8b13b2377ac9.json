            "description": "The Gyirong pluton is located in the middle of the Himalayan orogenic belt with the outcrops of distinct granitic phases, including two-mica granite and beryl-bearing granitic pegmatite (aplite included). The pluton is located in an area with an anomalous lithium enrichment on the geochemical mapping of lithium distribution in China. In this study, Li-rich micas are found in the Gyirong granitic phases. The texture characteristics are observed and in situ major and trace element compositions of micas are analyzed by using scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron microprobe analyzer (EMPA) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS). The micas are indicative for the degree and process of the lithium enrichment during the magmatic and hydrothermal stage. ",
