            "description": "The dataset includes channel flow measured at the second irrigation stage in spring (22 May, 2012), the third irrigation stage in spring (18 June, 2012) and the first irrigation stage in autumn (16 July, 2012). The time used in this dataset is in UTC+8 Time.\n\n1.1 Objective of measurement\n\nObjective of measuring channel flow are to provide the conference data for irrigation water optimal allocation model according to obtain reality water volume measured at Dou channel and Mao channel. Data set also is used to reference data for other observations such as eddy, biophysical parameters.\n\n1.2 Observation measures and principle\n\nMeasures: flow meter named Flowatch, which is made in Switzerland, observation precision: 0.1m/s; and rule, observation of which is 1cm.\nPrinciple: Flowatch, which is mechanical-based, is used to compute the velocity of the fluid according to vanes speed. The flow of channels is computed by using observed flow velocity and channel sectional area calculated on the basis of channel engineer sectional parameters and water level.\n\n1.3 Observation location and items\n\nObservation spots include Yingyi branch San dou (Liu She, Shang’er She, and Xia’er She of Shiqiao village), Si Dou (Qi She, Ba She, and Jiu She of Shiqiao village), and Wu Dou (Yi She of Shiqiao village) at Yingke irrigation district, and seven Mao channels branched from five star branch channel Si Dou San Nong.

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
