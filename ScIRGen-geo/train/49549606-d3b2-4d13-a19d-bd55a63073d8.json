            "description": "Mountain glaciers are important freshwater resources in Western China and its surrounding areas. It is at the drainage basin scale that mountain glaciers provide meltwater that humans exploit and utilize. Therefore, the determination of glacierized river basins is the basis for the research on glacier meltwater provisioning functions and their services. Based on the Randolph glacier inventory 6.0,  Chinese Glacier Inventories, China's river basin classifications (collected from the Data Centre for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences), and global-scale HydroBASINS (www.hydrosheds.org), the following dataset was generated by the intersection between river basins and glacier inventory: (1) Chinese glacierized macroscale and microscale river basins; (2) International glacierized macroscale river basin fed by China’s glaciers; (3) Glacierized macroscale river basin data across High Mountain Asia.  This data takes the common river basin boundaries in China and the globe into account, which is poised to provide basic data for the study of historical and future glacier water resources in China and its surrounding areas.",

                "China has the largest area of glaciers situated within the middle- and low-latitude areas worldwide. Rapid changes in mountain glaciers across western China in the last decades have not only affected glacial runoff and hazards but also had profound impacts on ecosystems and socioeconomic activities in the extensive cold and arid regions of Asia and even beyond. Mountain glaciers are a key part of Earth’s cryosphere, and they can be highly sensitive to even small climatic fluctuations. In recent decades, climate warming has accelerated and led to a widespread shrinking of glaciers globally, which not only affects river runoff, mountain hazards and global sea level but also has potentially severe implications for regional ecosystems, socioeconomic activities, and human cultural and spiritual aspects. China has the largest number of glaciers across the middle- and low-latitude areas worldwide. Recent studies have shown that there are a total of 48,571 glaciers with an area of approximately 51,840.1 km², which account for 22.5% of the number and 7.3% of the area of glaciers globally in the up-to-date Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 6.0; 215,547 glaciers with a total area of 705,738.8 km²). Glaciers in China are mainly distributed in the high mountains of the western region. Approximately 248.2 million people (2015) depend in part on glacial meltwater in China. Especially in northwestern arid inland basins with high water stress, including the Tarim, Junggar, Turpan-Hami, and Qaidam basins and Hexi Corridor, meltwater from glaciers in the Tien Shan, Qilian, and the northern Kunlun Mountains plays an extremely important role in the formation and development of local socioecological systems. In addition, the glaciers on the Chinese TP and the Altai, and western Chinese Tien Shan Mountains also supply drainage runoff for many large international river basins with highly dense populations, such as the Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, Ob, Lake Balkash, Mekong, and Salween River basins. In recent decades, numerous studies have investigated China’s glacier changes and their influencing factors using a range of approaches, including in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and modeling. These studies have indicated that an overall retreating trend in glaciers has been observed in China during the past half-century. The glacial recession in China has profound impacts on the socioecological systems of China, as well as other regions of Asia and even the world, through material and energy flows. However, in contrast to the overall glacier mass loss and area/volume shrinkage, changes in glaciers in the western Kunlun Mountains, Karakoram, and Pamirs have been very anomalous in recent decades. Their glacier mass has lost very little or has even grown, glacier area and volume has presented no significant changes, and a considerable number of glaciers have advanced or surged, which is described as the “Karakoram Anomaly” and has received increasing attention."

                "This study re-analyzes the first and second Chinese Glacier Inventories (CGI-1 and CGI-2) and summarizes available in-situ observation-based studies on glacier mass balance and length to provide a spatially explicit and coherent national-scale assessment of glacier changes and associated influencing factors in recent decades. We connect the glaciers between CGI-1 (from the 1950s to the 1980s) and CGI-2 (from the 2000s to the 2010s) one by one to explore the area, volume, and Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) changes at both the individual glacier and river basin scales for the first time. To address these gaps, we first conducted a spatially explicit and coherent national-scale assessment of glacier changes by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between glaciers from CGI-1 to CGI-2. Second, we further provided an overview of in-situ observed glacier mass balance and length changes in China. Finally, the influencing factors of glacier evolution encompassing climatology and climate change, as well as glacial morphology and topographic condition, were comprehensively analysed along with a review of previous relevant studies."

            "challenges": [
                "However, due to the inaccessibility of most glaciated areas and shortages of long-term human and financial resources, only a few glaciers have been observed, and very few glaciers have been continuously monitored as reference glaciers in the world. However, these studies did not give attention to individual glacial evolution between the two periods. Some glaciers emerged in CGI-2, but statistics were not available for CGI-1 because of the uncertainty of visual interpretation, which may have led to a lower estimate of retreat."
            ],
            "methods": [
                "In this study, we first removed 6201 glaciers from the CGI-1 and CGI-2 datasets because their real-time information was not updated but compiled, after which 40,176 and 42,370 glaciers remained, respectively. Then, we established the correspondence between glaciers from CGI-1 to CGI-2 following different kinds of evolutionary trajectories of modern mountain glaciers. We made an effort to discriminate the different types of glacier evolution based on glacier boundaries in CGI-1 and CGI-2 one by one."
            ],
            "dataset": [
                "CGI-1 was established based on aerial photographs and topographic maps from the 1960s to 1980s combined with extensive field investigations, and 34 parameters (e.g., area and elevation, etc.) were recorded following the standard guidebook of the World Glacier Inventory. Finally, a total of 46,377 glaciers with an area of approximately 59,425.2 km² in China from the 1960s to 1980s were measured, compiled, and published with 21 books and about 200 attached maps in Chinese. CGI-2 updated glacier outlines and basic parameters of 85.5% of China’s glaciers based on Landsat TM/ETM+, ASTER, and Google Earth images from 2004 to 2011. The other 6201 glaciers (24.5%), with an area of 8753.5 km², are mainly located in the eastern Nyainqentanglha Mountains and western Hengduan Mountains, which are frequently cloudy and covered by snow year-round; thus, no high-quality visible images are available."
            ],
            "findings": [
                "The results show that the long-term area and volume changes in China’s glaciers during the area-weighted average period from CGI-1 (around 1969) to CGI-2 (around 2008) were 5.6%/decade and 5.3%/decade, respectively, with a mean ELA change of 12.5 m/decade. Approximately 17.2% of the total number of glaciers in CGI-1 disappeared, only 5.5% of the glaciers advanced, and the majority of glaciers decreased in size during the period between CGI-1 and CGI-2, which was characterized by a shrinkage in area and volume and a rise in ELA or division into multiple branches. In-situ observation-based analysis shows that glacier length has reduced since at least the 1960s on average, and their trends have accelerated since the 1990s. The negative trend of mass balance was slightly larger than that of the reference glaciers globally during 1960–2019, while the mean mass loss in any given decade was lower than that of the global mean. Climatic conditions, as reflected in annual mean temperature and precipitation, are the primary causes of different spatiotemporal patterns of glacier change. A significant positive correlation is observed between annual absolute area/volume changes and snowfall variations, and a significant negative correlation is found with rainfall variations, but there is no significant correlation between the indicators of air temperature and glacial changes at the river basin scale."

                    "Answer": "The underlying causes behind the regional variations in glacier evolution observed in China include climatic conditions, such as annual mean temperature and precipitation, which are primary factors. A significant positive correlation is observed between snowfall variations and glacier changes, while rainfall variations show a negative correlation. However, there is no significant correlation between air temperature indicators and glacial changes at the river basin scale.",
