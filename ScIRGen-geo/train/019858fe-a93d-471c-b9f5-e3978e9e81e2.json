            "titleEn": "Whole-rock geochemical dataset of the ~120-130 Ma Yarlung Zangbo ophiolitic peridotites, South Tibet",
            "description": "This dataset mainly comprises whole-rock major and trace element contents (from the Baigang ophiolite of the central YZO; Tables 1&2), platinum group element (PGE) abundances and Re-Os isotopic compositions (Table 3) of the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone (YZO) ophiolitic peridotites in southern Tibet (China). All analyses were analyzed conducted at State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing). Whole-rock major element compositions were determined by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and the analytical precision is 1–3%; Whole-rock trace element concentrations were analyzed by a quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICP-MS) using external calibration and Rh as an internal standard. The analytical accuracy was generally better than 5% within the accepted values; (3) Whole-rock HSE abundance and Re-Os isotope analyses were conducted using an isotope dilution technique coupled with Carius tube aqua regia digestion. Osmium concentrations and isotopic compositions were determined by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry (N-TIMS), all other HSE abundances were measured by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS). The accuracy of PGE analysis (2SD) was better than 5%, and that of Os isotope analysis (2SD) was better than 0.5 ‰. The repeated analyzed values of the UB-N, an international reference meterial, are identical within uncertainties to the recommended values. The data have been published in Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (Xu, Y., Liu, J.*, Xiong, Q., Su, B.-X., Scott, J. M., Xu, B.,Zhu, D.-C., Pearson, D. G. (2020). The complex life cycle of oceanic lithosphere: A study of Yarlung-Zangbo Ophiolitic Peridotites, Tibet. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 277, 175-191). The main results are as follows: (1) Platinum group elements (Pd/Ir, Pt/Ir) are systematically decoupling from lithophile elements (e.g., Al2O3), while there is a positive correlation between Pd/Ir ratios and chalcophile elements (e.g., Cu). Combined with sulfide observation, it is confirmed that a BMS-rich melt metasomatism occurred in the YZO mantle after melt extraction. It is speculated that the metasomatic agent may be S-saturated forearc basaltic magmas, rather than S-undersaturated boninitic magmas; (2) There is no covariant relationship between Pd/Ir and 187Os/188Os, indicating that the influence of recent melt metasomatism on the Os isotopic composition of peridotite is limited. The simulation of mixing between the convective upper mantle and the oldest ophiolitic peridotite shows that the YZO mantle source region experienced a systematic melt extraction process after two end-member mixing; (3) Re-depleted Os model ages (TRD) indicates that the YZO mantle is heterogeneous at ~1000 km scale, and some old mantle domains (up to 2.2 Ga) are recycled into the Mesozoic Neo-Tethyan oceanic mantle (187Os/188Os peak: 0.126). The above data set illustrates the complex life cycle of the oceanic lithosphere and builds a relationship between plate tectonics and mantle evolution, which is of great significance for exploring the geodynamic mechanisms that control the composition and evolution of the Earth's upper mantle. In addition, this data set can provide a comparative reference for the study of whole-rock platinum group elements and Re-Os isotopes of peridotites and chromitites in the Bangong-Nujiang ophiolitic belt, which is of great scientific value for the systematic study of chromite mineralization and formation of Cr-PGE ore deposits.",

                    "Answer": "The decoupling of platinum group elements from lithophile elements suggests that after the extraction of melt, the mantle peridotites underwent a metasomatic event involving base metal sulfides (BMS-rich) that were influenced by a sulfur-saturated arc-related basaltic magma rather than sulfur-poor boninitic magma. This indicates complex interactions and processes in the mantle that are not directly correlated with traditional lithophile behavior.",

                    "Answer": "The use of techniques like ICP-OES, Q-ICP-MS, and HR-ICP-MS in geochemical data collection is primarily due to their ability to provide precise and accurate measurements of major and trace elements, as well as isotopic compositions. ICP-OES is used for main element analysis with a precision of 1-3%, suitable for obtaining comprehensive geochemical profiles. Q-ICP-MS offers superior precision (better than 5%) for trace elements based on internal and external standards, which is crucial for detailed geochemical characterization. HR-ICP-MS and N-TIMS are employed for platinum group elements and Re-Os isotopic compositions due to their high resolution and precision, essential for understanding complex processes such as melt extraction and metasomatism in mantle peridotites.",
