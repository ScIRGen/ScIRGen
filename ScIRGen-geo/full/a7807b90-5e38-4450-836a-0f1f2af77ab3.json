The temperature value of the permafrost on the sunny slope terrain is adjusted separately, and the fine-tuning model under the sunny slope terrain is established. The simulation results of the boreholes participating in the model construction are compared with the measured results, and the results show that the model is involved in the construction of the model The results show that the model is feasible to simulate the spatial distribution pattern of permafrost annual average ground temperature in the source area of the Yellow River",

This reliability can guide future studies to adopt similar methodologies or refine them to ensure precise data collection. By understanding the factors contributing to this consistency, researchers can explore adjustments to temperature models, data granularity, and spatial distribution to enhance the accuracy of permafrost distribution simulations. Additionally, the approach of adjusting temperature values for specific topographical conditions, like sunny slopes, offers insights into incorporating environmental variables into data collection and modeling processes to achieve a more comprehensive representation of permafrost conditions.",

The construction of a main model for permafrost distribution, which involves adjusting temperature values based on specific terrain conditions like sunny slopes, could also play a role in data accuracy. These adjustments and model constructions are crucial for simulating the spatial distribution pattern of average annual ground temperatures in permafrost regions.",

This is achieved by constructing a main model based on measured ground temperature data from 38 permafrost boreholes and separately adjusting the ground temperature values for sunny slopes.

This model is further refined by separately adjusting the ground temperature values for sunny slopes, leading to the development of a micro-adjustment model under these conditions. The model is then used to simulate and analyze ground temperature in the region, ensuring consistency between measured and annual average ground temperature values.",
