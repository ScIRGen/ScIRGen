            "description": "This dataset includes 23 OSL data from Badain Jaran. The Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) in northwest China is known for its unique landscape of giant sand dunes co-existing with permanent lakes. Giant dunes are already the tallest dunes on Earth, some of them as high as 400 meters. However, it is unclear whether the height of the dunes is continuing to increase under the current climate and environmental conditions. To determine the growth status of the dunes, we took 26 samples on the windward slopes of the two dunes and performed light dating. The results show that the thickness of the modern aeolian sand layer ranges from less than 1 m in the lower part of the windward slope, to more than 2 m in the middle, and then to 9 m in the upper part. This shows that under modern conditions, the height of the giant dunes continues to increase. The surface sediments at the bottom of the windward slope and adjacent lake basins are relatively old, ranging from 6 to 7 ka, indicating erosion in these areas. Increasing humidity and weakening winds in northern China associated with continued climate warming are likely to be major factors in sustaining the growth of giant sand dunes.",

                "The Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) in NW China is well known for its unique landscape of megadunes coexisting with permanent lakes. The megadunes are already the tallest sand dunes on earth, and some of them are up to 400 m high. Early studies of the mechanisms of megadune formation proposed the major role of the underlying topography, which was later confirmed using gravitational methods. Yang et al. (2011) found that sand movement was obstructed by an elevated rock layer or calcareous cement layer, resulting in sand accumulation and forming the megadunes. It has also been suggested that in addition to the underlying topography, sediment supply, wind regime, shrub vegetation, and climatic alternations between arid and moist conditions, are all important factors in megadune formation. Despite the progress that has been made understanding megadune formation, the modern growth status of megadunes is unclear: specifically, it is unknown whether or not growth of the megadunes is continuing under the present climatic and environmental conditions. The provision of a chronology is the key to understanding the processes of formation of megadunes. Dating using optically simulated luminescence (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) has distinct advantages compared to the radiocarbon and TL dating of eolian sands."

The thickness of the young surficial sand layer was used to reveal the modern growth status of the megadunes, and the possible relationship between the growth of the megadunes and modern climatic conditions is discussed."

            "challenges": [
                "However, only a few ages of sand dunes have been reported in the BJD. Most of these ages were obtained using radiocarbon and thermoluminescence (TL) dating methods; however, there are problems in the use of both methods. Organic material, such as plant remains and charcoal, are often rare in eolian sands, which is problematic for radiocarbon dating. Moreover, the application of TL dating is affected by the problem of insufficient bleaching, which can lead to dating results that are substantially overestimated. However, these ages were concentrated in the early to middle Holocene, and they are insufficient in number and temporal range to provide a comprehensive picture of the growth pattern of the megadunes. Consequently, the present growth status of the megadunes is unclear."

During drilling, the surficial dry sand layer was first removed, and hand drilling was conducted from the top of the wet sand layer."

This indicates that the height of the megadunes is continuing to increase under modern conditions. The surface sediments from the base of the windward slope and the adjacent lake basin have relatively old ages of 6–7 ka, indicating that these areas are eroding. The megadunes in the BJD are currently becoming increasingly high and steep due to the upward migration and accumulation of sand particles. Increased humidity and a weakened wind regime in northern China, related to ongoing climatic warming, are likely the main factors in maintaining the growth of the megadunes."
