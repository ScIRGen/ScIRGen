                    "Answer": "The desertification of the Minqin Oasis is primarily driven by human factors, contributing 39.53% to the process, with natural and human combined factors contributing 26.58%, and natural factors alone contributing 10.77%. Data collection methods, which include measuring annual precipitation, average temperature, wind speed, sunshine hours, and the number of windy days, as well as livestock numbers, water resource availability, and agricultural land use, have been used to explore these factors. The extreme scarcity of water resources is identified as the decisive factor in the desertification process.",

By analyzing data such as annual precipitation, average temperature, wind speed, sunshine duration, livestock numbers, well counts, farmland area, agricultural population, upstream water flow, and afforestation area, the dataset aims to determine the contributions of human and natural factors to desertification. It identifies human activities as the primary driver, with a contribution rate of 39.53%, emphasizing the need for better management of human production activities and optimized water resource allocation to combat desertification effectively.",

Additionally, compiling socio-economic data like livestock numbers, agricultural land area, well numbers, population involved in agriculture, upstream water flow, and afforestation efforts can provide insights. Combining these datasets can help determine the contributions of natural and human factors to desertification, with human activities identified as significant drivers. Moreover, integrating remote sensing and GIS technologies could enhance data accuracy and spatial analysis capabilities.",
