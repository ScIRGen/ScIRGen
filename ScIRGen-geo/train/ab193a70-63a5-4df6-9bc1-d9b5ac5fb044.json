            "description": "Plant functional types (PFT) is a combination of large plant species according to the ecosystem function and resource utilization mode of plant species. Each planting functional type shares similar plant attributes, which simplifies the diversity of plant species into the diversity of plant function and structure.The concept of plant-functional has been advocated by ecologists especially ecosystem modelers.The basic assumption is that globally important ecosystem dynamics can be expressed and simulated through limited  plant functional types.At present, vegetation-functional model has been widely used in biogeographic model, biogeochemical model, land surface process model and global dynamic vegetation model. For example, the land surface process model of the national center for atmospheric research (NCAR) in the United States has changed the original land cover information into the applied plant-functional map (Bonan et al., 2002).Functional plant has been used in the dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to predict the changes of ecosystem structure and function under the global change scenario.\n1.

Drawing method\nChina's 1km plant function map is based on the climate rules of land cover and plant function conversion proposed by Bonan et al. (Bonan et al., 2002).Ran et al., 2012).MICLCover land cover map is a blend of 1:100000 data of land use in China in 2000, the Chinese atlas (1:10 00000) the type of vegetation, China 1:100000 glacier map, China 1:10 00000 marshes and MODIS land cover 2001 products (MOD12Q1) released the latest land cover data, using IGBP land cover classification system.The evaluation shows that it may be the most accurate land cover map on the scale of 1km in China.Climate data is China's atmospheric driven data with spatial resolution of 0.1 and temporal resolution of 3 hours from 1981 to 2008 developed by he jie et al. (2010).The data incorporates Princeton land-surface model driven data (Sheffield et al., 2006), gewex-srb radiation data (Pinker et al., 2003), TRMM 3B42 and APHRODITE precipitation data, and observations from 740 meteorological stations and stations under the China meteorological administration.According to the evaluation results of RanYouhua et al. (2010), GLC2000 has a relatively high accuracy in the current global land cover data set, and there is no mixed forest in its classification system. Therefore, the mixed forest in the MICLCover land cover diagram USES GLC2000 (Bartholome and Belward, 2005).The information in xu wenting et al., 2005) was replaced.The data can be used in land surface process model and other related researches.",

Traditional land surface process models use land cover types to determine many biophysical parameters. For example, many time-invariant parameters (such as vegetation albedo, canopy height, and leaf angle distribution) in early versions of models like SIB and CLM are based on land cover types. However, modern land surface process models couple vegetation dynamic models to simulate the feedback of vegetation changes on the climate system, making the vegetation representation based on land cover types insufficient. Plant Functional Types (PFTs) are a grouping of a large number of plant species based on their ecosystem functions and resource utilization strategies. Each PFT shares similar plant attributes, simplifying the diversity of plant species into the diversity of plant functions and structures. The concept of Plant Functional Types is particularly favored by ecologists, especially ecosystem modelers."
