            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in C1, W2 and B2 of the Biandukou foci experimental area on Mar. 14, 2008, from 23:30 on 14 to 1:00 on 15, to be specific. The ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 23:21 BJT. The wheat stubble land, the deep plowed land and the rape stubble land were chosen for measurements.\n     (1) The surface radiative temperature and the physical temperature were measured by the handheld infrared thermometer. Besides, the land cover type was also recorded. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office.\n     (2) The gravimetric soil moisture (samples from 0-1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm, 5-10cm and 10-20cm) was measured by the microwave drying method. \n     (3) The frost depth by the chopstick and the ruler. The soil was considered frozen when it was hard and with ice crystal. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office.\n     Four data files were included, ASAR data, C1, W2 and B2 data.",

Microwave drying for soil moisture measurement is chosen because it allows for precise determination of soil water content by comparing the weight of soil samples before and after drying, which is essential for calibrating remote sensing data with ground truth values. These methods are selected to ensure accurate, reliable, and efficient data collection that aligns with the temporal and spatial resolution needs of the Envisat ASAR remote sensing data.",

This method can enhance data accuracy by reducing disturbance to the soil and providing consistent measurements across different surface types. However, it might also introduce errors due to emissivity variations across different materials, and accuracy may be affected by environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and humidity.",

This data is crucial to understand the thermal and hydrological dynamics of the area, improve the accuracy of remote sensing data interpretation, and validate satellite observations with ground truth data.

Soil moisture content is measured by taking samples from various depths (0-1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm, 5-10cm, 10-20cm), placing them in ziplock bags, and then drying them in a microwave to calculate the soil's weight moisture content.",
