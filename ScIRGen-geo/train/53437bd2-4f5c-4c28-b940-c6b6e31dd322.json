            "description": "This data set contains the vortex correlator observation data of zhangye wetland station in the middle reaches of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from March 18, 2016 to December 31, 2016.The site is located in zhangye city, gansu province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 100.44640E, 38.97514N, and the altitude is 1460.00m.The height of the vortex correlation instrument is 5.2m, the sampling frequency is 10Hz, the ultrasonic direction is due to the north, and the distance between the ultrasonic wind speed and temperature instrument (Gill) and the CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500A) is 25cm.\nThe original observation data of vorticity correlativity is 10Hz, and the released data is the data of 30 minutes processed by Eddypro software. The main steps of its processing include: outfield value elimination, delay time correction, Angle correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output by Eddypro software was also screened.(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation were excluded;(3) the missing rate of 10Hz original data is more than 10% every 30min;(4) the observed data of weak turbulence at night were excluded (u* less than 0.1m/s).The average period of observation data was 30 minutes, 48 data a day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.The suspicious data caused by instrument drift and other reasons are marked in red. Among them, the three-dimensional ultrasonic discontinuity of the vortex system from April to June 2016 has some problems, and some data are missing.\nObservations published include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (℃), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), Mr. Hoff length L (m), sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE,Carbon dioxide flux mass identification QA_Fc.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest are 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al. (2011) for observation data processing.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
