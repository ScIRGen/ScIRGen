            "description": "The dataset is the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) products of 2022 over the Tibetan Plateau. The dataset is produced based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the FVC equation which is based on dimidiate pixel model of NDVI. And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow. FVC is an important ecological parameter, which is widely used in ecological environment monitoring.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the FVC result of each image is stored in a folder including the FVC band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC\", for example, L8-OLI-131-036-20220326-LSR-BRDF-FVC;the FVC is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\", for example, \"L8-OLI-131-036-20220326-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset: the FVC results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the unit of the FVC results is %, for example the value is 80, that means the fractional vegetation is 80%, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
