            "description": "The land use / land cover data set of Heihe River Basin in 2011 is the Remote Sensing Research Office of Institute of cold and drought of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the remote sensing data of landsatm and ETM in 2011, combined with field investigation and verification, a 1:100000 land use / land cover image and vector database of Heihe River Basin is established.            The data set mainly includes 1:100000 land use graph data and attribute data in the lower reaches of Heihe River Basin.            The land cover data of 1:100000 (2011) in Heihe River Basin and the previous land cover are classified into six first-class categories (cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, urban and rural residents, industrial and mining land and unused land) and 25 second-class categories by the same hierarchical land cover classification system. The data type is vector polygon and stored in shape format.",

In this context, it involves dividing a region, such as a river basin, into primary and secondary categories, such as cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water bodies, residential land, and unused land. This classification includes specific attributes and spatial distribution positions and is used to create vector databases for analysis and visualization.",

                    "Answer": "Land use/land cover classification in large river basins like the Heihe River Basin can be challenging due to the diversity of landscapes, varying spatial distribution of land types, and the complexity of integrating remote sensing data with field surveys. Additionally, the need to differentiate between similar land cover types, such as distinguishing between different types of grasslands or distinguishing urban areas from rural settlements, adds to the complexity. The use of high-resolution remote sensing data, combined with field verification, helps address these challenges.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives include creating a detailed and accurate representation of land use and land cover in the downstream region of the Heihe River Basin. This involves utilizing GIS and remote sensing data from Landsat TM and ETM, along with field surveys for validation, to categorize the land into six primary and twenty-five secondary types.

The process includes conducting field verification to validate the remote sensing data. The dataset is organized into a vector polygon format, stored in Shape format, and follows a hierarchical land cover classification system. This system divides the area into primary and secondary categories, such as cropland, forest, grassland, water bodies, residential areas, and unused land, each with specific spatial distribution characteristics.
