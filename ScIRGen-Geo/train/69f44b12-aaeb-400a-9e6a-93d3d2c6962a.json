            "description": "Xizang winter wheat is a high yield crop developed rapidly in 1970s. It plays an important role in the crop production of wenliang River Valley, promotes the reform of plateau farming system, and plays an important role in increasing grain production in the whole region. The successful large-scale planting of winter wheat in Xizang has aroused strong response at home and abroad. In the course of development of Winter wheat in Xizang province, various unbalance phenomena will inevitably occur: severe dead seedlings in winter and spring; The growth process is too long and it is difficult to change stubble; Single variety; The steady increase of yield was affected by the failure of fertilizer and water condition and extensive cultivation management. Therefore, it is of positive significance to consolidate and develop winter wheat production in Tibet by summing up the experience of winter wheat development in the past ten years, expounding the basic characteristics of winter wheat production in plateau and discussing the main ways of increasing winter wheat production.",
            "descriptionCn": "西藏冬小麦是在七十年代迅速发展起来的一种高产作物。它在温凉河谷农区的作物生产上占有相当重要的地位，促进了高原耕作制度的变革，对全区的粮食增产发挥了重要的作用。西藏冬小麦的大面积种植成功，在国内外引起了强烈的反响。西藏冬小麦在其发展过程中，不可避免地会出现种种不平衡现象：严重的冬春死苗；生长过程太长换茬困难；品种单一；肥水条件跟不上和栽培管理粗放等，影响产量的稳定增长。因此，总结十多年来冬小麦发展的经验，阐明高原冬小麦生产的基本特点，探讨冬小麦增产的主要途径，对于巩固和发展西藏的冬小麦生产具有积极的意义。",
