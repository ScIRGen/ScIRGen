            "description": "APHRODITE and CHIRPS, and PGF and CPC were selected due to better quality in the Amu Darya Basin. The precipitation gradient and temperature lapse rate with altitude was further used to correct the selected precipitation and temperature products which were then used to drive the VIC-glacier model. The VIC-glacier model was calibrated and verified using monthly natural streamflow from 10 hydrological stationï¼Œmonthly snow depth data from 4 meteorological stations, NHSCE snow cover fraction data and glacier area change data. Future climate data from 20 Earth System Models (ESM) for 4 scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) provided by CMIP6 were selected and downscaled and corrected according to the historical grid data. Using the corrected historical grid data and future climate data, VIC-glacier model simulated annual natural streamflow in 1953-2019 and 2020-2100. The simulated natural streamflow can be used to assist water resources management in the river basin, and to analyze climate change and human activity impacts on the streamflow in the river basin. \nPlease cite the following paper while you are using the dataset: Mei Hou, Lan Cuo, Amirkhamza Murodov, Jin Ding, Yi Luo,Tie Liu, Xi Chen, 2022, Streamflow Composition and the Contradicting Impacts of Anthropogenic Activities and Climatic Change on Streamflow in the Amu Darya Basin, Central Asia, Journal of Hydrometeorology, https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-22-0040.1.

                    "Answer": "The 'VIC-glacier model' refers to a hydrological model used to simulate the natural runoff in river basins by integrating glacier dynamics. In the context of the Amu Darya River Basin at the Kerki station, it involves using corrected and validated meteorological data such as daily minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, and wind speed. This model is calibrated and validated using natural monthly runoff data from ten upstream observation stations, monthly snow depth data from four meteorological stations, remote sensing snow data, and glacier area change data, to establish a model adapted to the basin. It provides simulations for both historical (1953-2019) and future (2020-2100) periods using climate data from CMIP6 scenarios, ultimately aiding in water resource management and studying the impacts of climate change and human activity.",

                    "Answer": "The calibration and validation of a VIC-glacier model using historical natural runoff data from 10 upstream flow observation stations and snow depth data from 4 meteorological stations allows researchers to fine-tune the model to accurately reflect past conditions. This process helps ensure that the model can reliably simulate natural runoff, which is crucial for understanding how climate change scenarios (like those from CMIP6) might impact water resources in the future. By aligning model predictions with observed data, researchers gain confidence in the model's ability to project future scenarios, thereby improving the interpretation of climate change impacts on water resources.",

This approach allows for the assessment of a range of possible future climate conditions, which can improve the reliability of predictions regarding the impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources in the Amu Darya River basin. However, it may also introduce challenges related to data harmonization and calibration across different sources, which must be addressed to ensure consistency and accuracy in the simulation outputs.",
