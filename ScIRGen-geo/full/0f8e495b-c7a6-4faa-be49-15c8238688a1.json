            "description": "There are two kinds of data: Excel table and JPG model analysis chart.\nThe Excel data show that the major and trace elements of the whole rock were measured in the ALS laboratory group (Australian ICP-MS analysis laboratory in Guangzhou, China). The main elements were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF).\nTrace elements and rare earth elements were determined by element-2 mass spectrometer. The concentrations and isotopic ratios of Rb – Sr, SM – nd and u – th were determined by isotope dilution method. Zircon geochronology and Hf isotope data are also included.\nThe analysis data of JPG model include: 1. Geological map of Dabie orogenic belt showing early Cretaceous distribution; 2. Geological map of BHY shapinggou molybdenum deposit. 3. The geological section is magmatic rock and ore body of shapinggou molybdenum deposit. 4. According to the data of 313 geological team and Mineral Exploration Bureau of Anhui Provincial Bureau of geology, the sample position and the column section of the borehole are modified. 5.
