            "description": "Under the background of global warming, the frequency and intensity of drought are increasing. The lack of water resources, food crisis and ecological deterioration (such as desertification) caused by drought disasters directly threaten the national food security and social and economic development. The technical level of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management needs to be improved. One belt, one road area has one belt, one road area is fragile, agricultural land is concentrated and drought is frequent. Monitoring the drought level and its temporal and spatial changes in large areas by using remote sensing satellites is of great scientific and practical significance for scientifically grasping the drought pattern, regional differentiation characteristics and its impact on agricultural land in the \"one belt and one road\" area. The percentage of precipitation anomaly reflects the deviation degree between the precipitation of a certain period and the average state of the same period, expressed as a percentage.\nBased on the daily rainfall data of GPM imerg final run (GPM), the precipitation of corresponding area is calculated. The distribution characteristics of drought of different grades are analyzed by using the grade evaluation index of precipitation anomaly percentage. The spatial resolution is 200m.\nThe data area is 34 key nodes of Pan third pole (Abbas, Astana, Colombo, Gwadar, Mengba, Teheran, Vientiane, etc.).",
