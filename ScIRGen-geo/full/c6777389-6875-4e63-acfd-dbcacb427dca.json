            "description": "The data set is a record of glacier distribution in Hoh Xil region, including three tables: the distribution of modern glaciers in various mountain areas in Hoh Xil region, the distribution of modern glaciers in various river basins in Hoh Xil region, and the distribution of modern glaciers in different mountain height segments in Hoh Xil region. Hoh Xil, located in the hinterland of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, has an average altitude of more than 5000m and a very cold climate. According to the catalogue of China's glaciers and the author's re statistics on the 1 / 100000 topographic map, 437 modern glaciers are developed in the whole region, covering an area of 1552.39 square kilometers, with ice reserves of 162.8349 cubic kilometers, becoming an important source of water supply for many rivers and lakes in the region. Through this data set, we can know more about the distribution of glaciers in this area.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format and can be opened and read by office software such as Office and WPS.It contains three workbooks, which are the distribution of modern glaciers in all mountains of Hoh Xil region, the distribution of modern glaciers in all basins of Hoh Xil region and the distribution of modern glaciers in different mountain heights of Hoh Xil region in turn.The table introduces in detail the measurement data of modern glaciers in Hoh Xil region, such as the distribution area, number of glaciers, glacier area and ice storage.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges of collecting glacier distribution data in high-altitude regions like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau likely include harsh climate conditions, difficult terrain, and limited accessibility. These factors can influence the accuracy and completeness of a dataset by potentially leading to gaps in data collection, reliance on remote sensing or satellite imagery, and the need for careful validation against on-ground measurements. Additionally, the high elevation and severe cold can impact the longevity and functionality of data collection equipment, further complicating data accuracy and coverage.",

                    "Answer": "The Qinghai Hoh Xil region is located in the core of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with an average altitude above 5000 meters and a harsh climate, which can pose significant challenges in accurately mapping glacier distribution. The reliance on data from the Chinese Glacier Inventory and manual recalculations on 1:100,000 scale topographic maps could also introduce potential errors or discrepancies in the data regarding the 437 glaciers, their coverage area of 1552.39 square kilometers, and ice reserves of 162.8349 cubic kilometers.",

                    "Answer": "Using a dataset that records modern glacier distribution across different mountain heights in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region helps to enhance understanding of the hydrological systems by providing insights into how glaciers contribute to river and lake water supplies. The data collected on the distribution of 437 modern glaciers and their ice reserves, with a total area of 1552.39 square kilometers and an ice volume of 162.8349 cubic kilometers, serves as a crucial source for understanding water resource replenishment in this high-altitude, cold climate region.",
