      "description": "As an important part of global semi-arid grassland, adequately understanding the spatio-temporal variability of evapotranspiration (ET) over the temperate semi-arid grassland of China (TSGC) could advance our understanding of climate, hydrological and ecological processes over global semi-arid areas. Based on the largest number of in-situ ET measurements (13 flux towers) within the TSGC, we applied the support vector regression method to develop a high-quality ET dataset at 1 km spatial resolution and 8-day timescale for the TSGC from 1982 to 2015. The model performed well in validation against flux tower‐measured data and comparison with water-balance derived ET.",

        "Semi-arid areas account for about 15% of global land area, which feeds about 14% of the global population. It’s a critical region for Earth’s climate due to the vast area, high sensitivity to global warming, significant feedbacks on the global climate system, and the fragile eco-environment to anthropogenic disturbances. The temperate semi-arid grassland of China (TSGC) constitutes an integral part of the Mongolian Plateau and Eurasian semi-arid steppe ecosystem. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominated component (i.e., 80-90% of precipitation) of the hydrologic cycle over the arid and semi-arid regions. The change in water balance (WB, the sum of the total runoff and the change in the total terrestrial water storage, defined as precipitation-ET) is also a key aspect of the water cycle and is considered as the primary indicator of water availability. However, accurately estimating ET remains challenging in the arid and semi-arid areas where the two main types of models for ET estimation (i.e., process-based and remote sensing-based ET model) generally performed worse than in humid areas. The poor performance of process-based ET models in arid and semi-arid ecosystems is mainly because they require extensive and accurate parameterizations of land surface factors, which are highly variable in these regions. The challenges for remote sensing-based ET models in this region include low vegetation signal-to-noise ratios, high spatial heterogeneity from plot to regional scales, and irregular growing seasons due to unpredictable seasonal rainfall and frequent periods of drought. Machine learning (or data-driven) approaches have been identified as the most suitable approach for ET estimation, and was applied to upscale the eddy-covariance (EC) flux tower measurements from site to region scale using remote sensing, meteorological reanalysis, and land cover data."

      "research objective": [
        "In this study, we improved the ET estimates over the TSGC by a machine learning model driven by the largest number of in-situ ET measurements (13 flux towers) in this region till now. Based on the estimated regional ET dataset, we aim to (1) assess the magnitude, inter-annual variability, and spatial changes in ET and WB over the TSGC during 1982-2015, (2) identify the drivers of ET and WB trends, and (3) compare the ET dataset of this study with four commonly used global ET datasets."

After the above processing, we finally obtained a total of 1012 sets of 8-day LE data in which 7 flux sites of typical steppe and 6 flux sites of sandy grassland provided 617 and 395 sets of 8-day LE data, respectively."

The ETSVR showed similar inter-annual variability with ETwb (the average R2 was 0.55), while the range of inter-annual variability in ETwb is much higher than that of ETSVR. Overall, although the SVR-ET model was not constrained by water balance, the predicted ET coincided with the magnitude and variability of the ET estimation based on the catchment water balance equation."
