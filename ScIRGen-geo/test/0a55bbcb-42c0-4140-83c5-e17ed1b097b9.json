The soil moisture is monitored vertically using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR), checking every 10 cm depth. After irrigation, measurements are conducted intensively, with data collected every 3 hours within the first 24 hours, then three times daily for the next five days, twice daily from day five to ten, and once daily from day ten to fifteen.",

                    "Answer": "TDR monitoring refers to the use of Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) technology to measure the soil moisture content. In the context mentioned, TDR is used to measure soil moisture at various depths by placing Trime tubes in the field and surrounding area, and monitoring the moisture content at 10 cm intervals vertically. This method includes intensive monitoring immediately after irrigation, with measurements taken every 3 hours within the first 24 hours, subsequently three times daily for the next five days, twice daily for days 5-10, and once daily for days 10-15.",

                    "Answer": "The periodic monitoring, which includes frequent measurements immediately after irrigation and gradually decreasing frequency over 15 days, can reveal how quickly the soil absorbs and retains water. It can also indicate changes in soil moisture distribution over time, allowing researchers to infer patterns of water movement and retention in the soil profile. This information helps in understanding the efficiency of irrigation practices and the natural drainage characteristics of the soil.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goal is to understand the soil moisture dynamics in agricultural fields and their surrounding areas after irrigation events, thereby optimizing water usage and improving irrigation efficiency. By monitoring soil moisture content at various depths and intervals, it is possible to gain insights into water infiltration, retention, and distribution patterns, which can inform better agricultural management practices.",

                    "Answer": "In an agricultural setting, like the one described, soil moisture dynamics can be accurately monitored using TDR technology by strategically placing Trime tubes in the field based on the characteristics of the selected plot and surrounding areas. For instance, one Trime tube can be placed within the cornfield, while additional tubes are arranged perpendicularly to the field path. Monitoring should be done vertically at 10 cm intervals. Post-irrigation, data collection should be intensified, with measurements taken every 3 hours within the first 24 hours, followed by three sets of measurements per day for the next five days. From day 5 to 10, measurements can be reduced to twice per day, and from day 10 to 15, once per day. This procedural approach ensures comprehensive monitoring of soil moisture variations post-irrigation.",
