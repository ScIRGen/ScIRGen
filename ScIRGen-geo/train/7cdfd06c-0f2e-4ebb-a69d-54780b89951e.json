            "description": "The Antarctic sea ice cloud-reconstructed albedo dataset, with spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 1 day, covering the period from January 2012 to December 2021. Due to the snow and ice albedo feedback mechanism, the Antarctic sea ice albedo plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's radiation budget and controlling polar climate change. The production of this dataset uses the VIIRS 1 km surface reflectance product (VNP09GA) as one of the main input data. The Multiband Reflectance Iteration algorithm (MBRI) is used for the retrieval of sea ice albedo under clear-sky condition, and the sea ice albedo under the cloudy condition is reconstructed by combining spatiotemporal filtering and physical model. Validation compared with the sea ice albedo measurements from two automatic weather stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) suggests that the biases at the two stations are -0.0221 and -0.0363, and root mean square error (RMSE) values are 0.0664 and 0.0754. These results indicate that this dataset exhibits superior spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy compared to existing products. This dataset is stored in GeoTIFF format, with the variable being the true albedo of sea ice, also known as blue-sky albedo. In addition, multiband reflectance data covering the shortwave range was used in the calculation process, so the dataset represents the broadband albedo of the shortwave range. The albedo is a dimensionless parameter and needs to be multiplied by a scale factor of 0.0001 when used. This dataset adopts SIN projection, with a longitude range of 180 ° W~180 ° E and a latitude range of 50 ° S~80 ° S, covering a total of 53 tiles (v14: h06~h29; v15: h09~h26; v16: h11~h17, h21~h24). The v16 tiles encompass portions of the Antarctic ice sheet and these areas need to be cropped when using the data. The ocean water area is set to a filling value of -1. This data can be used for evaluating and predicting the radiation budget and loss status of Antarctic sea ice, as well as research on climate change and other aspects.",

                "The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), the second largest ice sheet on Earth (after the Antarctic Ice Sheet), is particularly sensitive to surface energy balance and sea-level changes. Surface broadband albedo, hereafter referred to as albedo, is defined as the ratio of the reflected solar radiation flux to the incident flux on the surface. In the ice- and snow-covered parts of the Arctic, albedo is a crucial indicator of the surface energy budget. A slight change in snow surface albedo can generate significant feedback on the energy budget of the surface – air system, leading to a substantial fluctuation in the energy flux on the surface of GrIS. Therefore, GrIS’s snow and ice albedo is a critical input parameter for global climate change models. With the rapid development of Earth observation (EO) and information processing technology from the 1980s until the present, the inversion of albedo by EO data has been proven to be an effective scientific method. At present, available albedo products in GrIS include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring, the GlobAlbedo, the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) albedo products. All the aforementioned albedo products have a temporal resolution of 8 days to 1 month and a spatial resolution of 1 – 25 km. Given their coarse spatial and temporal resolutions, meeting the needs of climate change and other related studies is difficult. In recent years, albedo products with finer resolution have been widely used. They include Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo products, with daily temporal resolution and spatial resolution of 500 m and 750 m. MODIS products have been shown to have the highest potential for snow and ice research because of their high spatiotemporal resolution, long time span, and free access. Numerous studies have demonstrated the excellent monitoring capability of MODIS albedo products.",
                "To improve the spatiotemporal continuity of albedo products, considerable effort has been exerted to the tasks of cloud removal and albedo reconstruction. Studies on reconstructing albedo can be generally categorized into indirect and direct processing strategies. An indirect processing strategy aims to reconstruct albedo by improving the quality of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for estimating albedo. By contrast, a direct processing strategy fills the missing pixels of existing albedo products. All the aforementioned reconstruction techniques are based on spatiotemporal information to fill albedo under clear sky condition, without considering the albedo of snow and ice in real cloudy-sky cases. In fact, clouds affect the feedback of snow and ice albedo by decreasing the short-wave radiation that reaches the surface and increasing downward long-wave radiation. Therefore, incorporating the physical role of clouds on snow and ice albedo is important, particularly in regions such as GrIS, where large amounts of snow and ice accumulate on the surface and clouds are persistent. Moreover, the high frequency of clouds in the polar regions leads to large spatial and temporal lack of remote sensing data, which is difficult to handle by most of the existing methods.",
                "To overcome these problems, this study proposes a method for reconstructing snow and ice albedo under cloudy skies by combining spatiotemporal and physics-informed models, referred to as STPM hereafter. Among MODIS albedo products, MOD10A1 daily snow albedo developed by Klein and Stroeve on the basis of the snow bidirectional reflectance model has been validated in GrIS by Stroeve et al. and widely used. The proposed method utilizes auxiliary data, including cloud optical thickness and solar zenith angle.",

In the Arctic region, continuous cloud coverage reaches 60% – 90%, limiting the subsequent applications of MODIS albedo products.",

We reconstruct albedo based on MOD10A1 for the whole Greenland region from 2001 to 2020.",

Then, we fit the variation of snow and ice albedo long time-series data by using the Whittaker iterator. Finally, cloudy pixels are estimated on the basis of the physical conversion relationship between clear-sky albedo and cloudy albedo to recover the cloudy-sky albedo of snow and ice. In practice, we set up a 100 × 100 search box within a neighborhood that is centered on the target pixel to find similar pixels. We employ a weight of each point to indicate the importance of each point in the fitting process, providing higher weights to the points with larger differences between the initial and long-term trend albedos.
