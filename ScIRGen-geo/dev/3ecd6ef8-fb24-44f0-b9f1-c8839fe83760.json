            "description": "Continued global warming and degradation of the cryosphere are raising concerns about adaptation to environmental instability in mountain areas. In recent decades, glacier-related slope failures, such as ice avalanches and rock avalanches on glaciers, have been frequently documented. In this study, we create a global inventory of glacier-related landslides to examine their distribution, trends, fractures, and relationship to climate change. During the period 1901-2019, 737 glacier-related landslides were recorded, including 156 ice avalanches, 89 ice-rock avalanches, 26 glacier slides, and 466 supraglacial rock avalanches. The Pacific Northwest had the most recorded cases (N = 440, 60%), with supraglacial rockfalls being the most dominant. In addition, the currently published list of glacial lake outburst floods of regional or global nature is integrated and refined, and moraine lake outburst flood events are separated separately. 380 moraine lake outburst flood events were counted between 1901 and 2020, making it the most complete list available on a global scale.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in accurately recording and maintaining a comprehensive global inventory of glacier-related slope failures and moraine-dammed lake outburst floods may arise from factors such as the remote and inaccessible nature of many glacier regions, the difficulty in monitoring and documenting events over an extended period (from 1901 to 2020), and the variability in data availability and quality across different regions. Furthermore, the ongoing global warming and cryosphere degradation complicate the tracking of these events, as they may increase the frequency and unpredictability of such occurrences.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating region-specific records of glacier-related collapse events with global lists of ice-dammed lake outburst floods may enhance the accuracy and completeness by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution and frequency of such events. This integration could lead to a more detailed global inventory, capturing nuances and specific cases that might be overlooked in broader datasets. However, it may also introduce challenges in harmonizing data formats, definitions, and quality standards across different regions, potentially affecting the reliability of the dataset.",

                    "Answer": "The goal of developing such a dataset is to study the distribution, trends, and failure mechanisms of glacier-related slope collapses and their relationship with climate change. By establishing a comprehensive global inventory, researchers can better understand the patterns and impacts of these events, particularly in the context of ongoing global warming and cryosphere degradation. This knowledge is crucial for adapting to the instability of mountain environments and for improving the completeness of currently available regional or global inventories.",
