            "description": "This data includes geochemical and mineralogical data of Early Jurassic nurseries black shale. The samples were collected from the black shale in Changliangshan area, South Qiangtang basin. The total organic carbon was measured by LECO cs-200 carbon sulfur analyzer in Wuxi Institute of Sinopec. The massive rocks and minerals were tested by X-ray diffraction method in Beijing Institute of uranium geology of China Nuclear Industry Corporation (CNNC). We have studied the geochemistry and mineralogy of the organic poor sediments in the middle late torrian of the Qiangtang Basin in the eastern Tethys. Combined with previous studies, we investigated the factors controlling the organic matter enrichment in the Tuoer period of the Qiangtang basin. The results show that the organic matter rich sediments deposited in the layered water with anoxic bottom water in the early torrian, which is conducive to the preservation of organic matter. The warm and humid climate in this period is conducive to the growth of plankton, thus improving the primary productivity of surface water. In the middle late torrian, the sediments with poor organic matter were deposited in the oxidized water, which was not conducive to the preservation of organic matter. The average diameter and standard deviation of filiform pyrite are larger than 12mm and 5mm respectively. These results further support the investigation that the sediments were deposited under aerobic conditions. The cold and dry climate in this period limited the growth of plankton, resulting in lower primary productivity of surface water. The P / Ti ratios in the sobcha section range from 0.16 to 0.34, which are close to PAAS (0.13) and pelagic clay (0.33), and far lower than the modern P / Ti ratio (~ 2 – 8) in the equatorial Pacific characterized by productivity improvement in 1990. During the whole torrian, the terrestrial detrital input was limited and uniform, and the dilution effect of detrital input on organic matter was very small. In addition, the different enrichment of organic matter in early torrian shale and marl should be attributed to the dilution of carbonate. Finally, we believe that redox conditions and Paleoclimatic conditions are the main controlling factors of organic matter enrichment in torrian.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in organic matter enrichment suggest that during the early Toarcian period, the sediments were deposited in a stratified water body with anoxic bottom waters, which was conducive to the preservation of organic matter. This environment was supported by a warm and humid climate that enhanced primary productivity. In contrast, during the middle-late Toarcian period, the sediments were deposited in an oxidized water body, which was not favorable for organic matter preservation. The colder and drier climate during this time limited phytoplankton growth, resulting in lower primary productivity. These differences in environmental conditions, including redox conditions and paleoclimate, are inferred to be the main controlling factors for organic matter enrichment during the Toarcian period.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in the organic matter enrichment of Early Toarcian black shales are influenced by several factors including the depositional environment's oxygenation levels, which were conducive to preserving organic matter due to anoxic bottom waters. The warm and humid climate of the time supported the growth of plankton, thus enhancing primary productivity in surface waters. Additionally, the limited and uniform terrigenous detrital input minimized the dilution effect on organic matter. The differentiation in organic matter enrichment between shales and marl in the Early Toarcian should also be attributed to the dilution effect of carbonates. These factors are considered to be the main controls on the organic matter enrichment process during data collection.",

The data suggest that organic-rich sediments were deposited in stratified water bodies with anoxic bottom waters, which were conducive to organic matter preservation, while organic-poor sediments were deposited in oxidized waters where such preservation was not favorable. Additionally, warm and humid climates favored high primary productivity in surface waters, whereas cold and dry climates limited it.",

The research aims to identify conditions such as anoxic bottom water environments and warm, humid climates that facilitate organic matter preservation and plankton growth, which enhance primary productivity. Additionally, it helps distinguish between periods of organic-rich and organic-poor sediment deposition and the role of detrital input and carbonate dilution in organic matter distribution.",
