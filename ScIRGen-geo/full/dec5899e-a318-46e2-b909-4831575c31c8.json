            "description": "This data set comprises the oxygen isotope and geochemical data of two deep-drilled ice cores drilled in the Puruogangri ice sheet (33°55'N, 89°05'E, altitude: 6070 meters) in the central Tibetan Plateau in 2000. The ice core depths are 118.4 and 214.7 meters, respectively. \nSource of the data: National Centers for Environmental Information (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/ice-core) .\nThe data set contains 6 tables, which are the average values of 1 oxygen isotope per meter of the Puruogangri ice core, the 10-year average data of 1 oxygen isotope of the Puruogangri ice core, the average values of 2 oxygen isotope and the soluble aerosol concentrations per meter of the Puruogangri ice core, the 5-year average data of 2 oxygen isotope and aerosol concentrations of Puruogangri ice core, 10-year average data of 2 oxygen isotope and aerosol concentrations of the Puruogangri ice core, and the 100-year average values of 2 oxygen isotopic and aerosol concentrations of the Puruogangri ice core.
