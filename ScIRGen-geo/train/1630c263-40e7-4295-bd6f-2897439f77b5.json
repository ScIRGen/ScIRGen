Remote sensing has become widely used as a macro-observing system for land-cover mapping, which can substitute for plant functional type (PFT) as the baseline. Several moderate to fine resolution global land-cover datasets, which are presented in detail in Table I, based on different satellite sensors are available from different research groups. These land-cover datasets listed in Table I have large variability for three reasons: 1) the data quality and properties are different; 2) there is no standard approach for classifying continuous vegetation cover into discrete categories; and 3) they are not consistent with the Earth System Model’s (ESM) requirements, because the concept of PFT, whose traits represent a combination of spectral relationships, and climatic, ecological, and theoretical assumptions, used in ESMs cannot be mapped directly using remote-sensing land-cover datasets. In addition, the classification accuracies of land-cover datasets vary and are hardly suited for land-process modeling and applications at a river basin scale. The highest uncertainty in land-cover classification from optical remotely sensed imagery occurs most frequently between the cropland and grassland categories and in dryland systems among the shrub, grassland, and forest categories because of differences in the minimum threshold required for forest cover. For the HRB, most are distributed over an arid region, so the vegetation classification in the HRB based on current land-cover datasets would cause very large uncertainty and may cause great error or even the failure of eco-hydrological and land-process modeling."

Land use and land cover are the key factors for understanding the interactions between global changes and human activities, such as social, economic, and cultural activities. Moreover, it is one of the key parameters of land process modeling, and more accurate land use and land cover data will improve the accuracy of ecological, hydrological, and atmospheric models. Consequently, land use and land cover data are now widely used in many kinds of researches, such as biodiversity, carbon cycle, public health, crop yield estimation, urban sprawl, forest monitoring, and so on.
