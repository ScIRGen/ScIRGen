            "description": "The data sets contains the content of fungal spores and  (Ce+Fa/Po+Fa) ratio data from Gonghai Lake (38°54′N, 112°14′E, altitude 1860 m) in northern China over the past ~2000 years. We calculated pollen (Ce+Fa/Po+Fa) ratio of 321 samples and we identified the fungal spores of 216 sedimentary samples to reconstruct changes in cultivation and grazing intensity over the past ~2,000 years in northern China. Time-series analysis reveals that the arable farming phases had a longer periodicity than the grazing phases, possibly because of the greater resilience of the former to climate change and the attachment of agriculturalists to their land. Our findings potentially help improve our understanding of the impact of land use on soil degradation. The data is stored in Excel format.",

                    "Answer": "The collection of fungal spores involves identifying these spores from 216 sedimentary samples, which helps in understanding grazing intensity, while the calculation of the (Ce+Fa/Po+Fa) ratio from 321 samples aids in reconstructing changes in arable farming intensity. The comparison suggests that each method provides complementary insights into different aspects of historical land use, with fungal spore data offering more details on grazing and the ratio data focusing on cultivation phases.",

                    "Answer": "The methods used to collect fungal spores and pollen ratio data from sedimentary samples in regions like Gonghai Lake have been influenced by the need to reconstruct changes in cultivation and grazing intensity over the past ~2,000 years. These methods likely consider the resilience of arable farming phases to climate change and the attachment of agriculturalists to their land, which in turn influences how data is sampled and analyzed to understand land use impact on soil degradation.",

It may reveal how these activities have evolved in response to climate changes, with arable farming showing longer periodicity and greater resilience compared to grazing. This understanding can help in assessing the impact of historical land use on soil degradation and inform sustainable agricultural practices.",

These parameters provide insights into historical land use patterns, the resilience of different agricultural practices to climate change, and their impact on soil degradation. This knowledge helps improve our understanding of how past human activities have influenced the environment, which can inform current land management and conservation strategies.",
