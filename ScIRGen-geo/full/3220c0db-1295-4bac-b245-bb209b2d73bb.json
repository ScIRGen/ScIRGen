This dataset is constructed based on the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.1° from 1979 to 2018 and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) gridded data with a spatial resolution of 0.5° from 1901 to 2020. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.1° and a time range from January 1901 to December 2020.  The spatial dimension of data is 74°E–106°E, 24°N–40°N. The data format is NETCDF. The dataset has a long-term temporal span and high spatial resolution, which provides an alternative basis for the temperature change over the Tibetan Plateau.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the highest plateau on the Earth, which plays a significant role in regional climate change and atmospheric systems. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has experienced a prominent warming in recent decades, and there are many datasets to help people to understand the variations and distributions of climate change over the TP. However, the observed stations, satellite images, simulation models, and reanalysis products have weaknesses of sparse spatial distribution, short-term span, inconvenient access, and coarse resolution, respectively.",
                "Long-term regional climate change can indirectly reveal internal variability, associations, and feedback of climate systems. The accurate dataset is an effective basis for detecting whether global warming is caused by natural climate variability or anthropogenic factors. Currently, the common historical climate temperature dataset is generated from existing natural archives such as tree rings and ice cores. Recent works have used innovative deep-learning methods to handle large datasets on geosciences. However, since variables in geoscience cannot be observed everywhere, it is a great challenge to extrapolate continental or global estimates from observations and proxy products. The Generative adversarial network (GAN) is one of the most important approaches in artificial intelligence and has received widespread attention for its excellent data-generation capabilities. Therefore, GAN will be suitable for reconstructing climate fields by using accurately observed stations and reliable auxiliary variables. The previous studies confirmed the effectiveness of the GAN on the reconstruction of the climatic and meteorological variables. Currently, most studies used proxy data for data reconstruction and mainly focused on the eastern part but not the whole TP. On the other hand, the temporal and spatial resolution of existing historical datasets is relatively low.",

After that, 0.1° × 0.1° CRU Ts 4.0 is masked according to the location of observed stations (The value of CRU Ts 4.0 is set as 0 on the non-observations grid). The model is built using the CMFD from 1979 to 2018 as the training samples of the network. The monthly GAN-T from 1901 to 2020 is generated by masked CRU Ts 4.0 as input variables of the neural network. The observed stations from 1961 to 1978 are not involved in the dataset generation thereby being used to verify the spatial accuracy of the dataset. The validation method is the ten-fold cross-validation. The proxy datasets are applied to estimate the temporal variation.",

Here, the temperature of CRU TS v4 over the TP (74°E – 106°E, 24°N – 40°N) from 1901 to 2020 is selected as the basis for the reconstructed dataset in this study. The digital elevation model (DEM) used in this study is the aster global DEM (Aster GDEM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m, which is provided by the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration in America) and METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry in Japan). Here, the DEM is an input variable of GAN. The daily meteorological dataset of basic meteorological elements of China National Surface Weather Station (V3.0) is rigorously processed and tested by the China National Meteorological Information Center. Here, the daily 235 observations over the TP from 1979 to 2020 are calculated monthly value and seen as the criterion of bias correction for the CRU Ts 4.0. In this study, the ERA5, NECP/NCAR, and GLPT (Global Land Precipitation and Temperature) have long spans thereby being introduced to estimate the robustness of temperature field from the GAN (noted as GAN-T) and downscaled CRU by elevation (noted as DCRU-T).",

In comparison with the CRU, Global Land Precipitation and Temperature (GLPT), ERA5, and NCEP/NCAR, the temperature from the GAN have the best robustness, especially over the western TP, suggesting the generated dataset has the best performance. Besides, compared to CRU, the temperature of GAN has an improved resolution and can present a more detailed texture structure of the temperature. Compared to Downscaling CRU with the same resolution, the temperature of GAN inherits the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of CMFD and therefore better reflects the variation of temperature with longitude. Overall, the reconstruction for the monthly surface air temperature over the TP during 1901 – 2020 has a long-term temporal span and high spatial resolution, which provides an alternative basis for the temperature change over the TP.",

The result demonstrates that the GAN-T can present more accurate and reliable spatial characteristics than the DCRU-T. The result illustrates that the GAN-T highly coincides with the observations, and it has a good performance to simulate the temperature spatiotemporal characteristics over the TP. It can be seen that the GAN-T shows the best robustness relative to the other four datasets, particularly over the northwestern parts of the TP.",

Compared to DCRU-T with the same resolution, the GAN-T inherits the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of CMFD-T and therefore better reflects the variation of temperature with longitude.
