            "description": "The DEMs of the typical glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau were provided by the bistatic InSAR method. The data were collected on November 21, 2013. It covered Puruogangri and west Qilian Mountains with a spatial resolution of 10 meters, and an elevation accuracy of 0.8 m which met the requirements of national 1:10 000 topographic mapping. Considering the characteristics of the bistatic InSAR in terms of imaging geometry and phase unwrapping, based on the TanDEM-X bistatic InSAR data, and adopting the improved SAR interference processing method, the surface DEMs of the two typical glaciers above were generated with high resolution and precision. The data set was in GeoTIFF format, and each typical glacial DEM was stored in a folder.\nFor details of the data, please refer to the Surface DEMs for typical glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau - Data Description.",

In 2000, the U.S. Space Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) demonstrated the outstanding performance of dual-station InSAR technology in topographic mapping. With the development of spaceborne SAR data acquisition capabilities and multi-baseline InSAR analysis methods, repeat-pass InSAR technology has also been increasingly refined for topographic mapping. As a continuation of the X-SAR/SRTM program, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Astrium GmbH jointly implemented the TanDEM-X scientific program, with the primary goal of obtaining global HRTI-3 standard DEMs. The TanDEM-X dual-station SAR consists of the TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite and the TanDEM-X (TDX) satellite, forming a dual-station SAR interferometry system that achieves spaceborne dual-station SAR interferometry for the first time. Due to the dual-station observation mode's ability to effectively eliminate the effects of atmospheric disturbances and temporal decorrelation, this technology has significant advantages and broad application prospects in the field of high-resolution and high-precision DEM mapping on a global scale."

In the specific data processing, the azimuth and range looks are both set to 5 according to the radar imaging characteristics of the TSX/TDX satellites and the DEM resolution requirements, resulting in an azimuth resolution of 16.5 m and a range resolution of 12.6 m for the interferogram. The filtering method used is the Goldstein Filter, which has good denoising effects while preserving the integrity of the interferometric fringes. The phase unwrapping employs the minimum cost flow (MCF) method, which balances computational speed and accuracy."

However, this repeat-pass InSAR is still challenging for glacier applications because it commonly suffers from atmospheric disturbance (mainly due to variations of the troposphere and the ionosphere between the repeat-pass SAR acquisitions), as well as temporal decorrelation induced by ice melting, snow accumulation and glacier movement between acquisitions."
