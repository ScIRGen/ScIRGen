            "description": "Advanced along orbit scanning radiometer (AATSR) is an advanced tracking scanning radiometer sensor mounted on the European Space Agency ENVISAT satellite. It is one of many high-precision and stable infrared radiometers for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST). Its accuracy can reach 0.3k, and it can also be used to record meteorological data. AATSR is a multi-channel imaging radiometer. Its main goal is to provide global ocean surface temperature with high accuracy and stability for monitoring the earth's climate change. At present, there are 38 ENVISAT AATSR images in Heihe River Basin. \nThe acquisition time is 2008-05-17 (2 scenes), 2008-05-27 (2 scenes), 2008-05-30 (2 scenes), 2008-06-02 (2 scenes), 2008-06-12 (2 scenes), 2008-06-15 (2 scenes), 2008-06-18 (2 scenes), 2008-06-21 (2 scenes), 2008-07-04 (2 scenes), 2008-07-072008-07-102008-07-172008-07-202008-07-232008-07-262008-08-022008-08-052008-08-082008 -08-11，2008-08-14，2008-08-21，2008-08-24，2008-08-27，2008-08-30，2008-09-06，2008-09-12，2008-09-15，2008-09-18，2008-09-25。 \nThe product level is L1B, which has been corrected by radiation but not by geometry. \nThe ENVISAT AATSR remote sensing data set of Heihe comprehensive remote sensing joint test was obtained through the China EU \"dragon plan\" project (Project No.: 5322) (see the data use statement for details).",

It is a multi-channel imaging radiometer designed specifically for providing global ocean surface temperatures for climate monitoring. Compared to other infrared radiometers, the AATSR's advanced along-track scanning capability and its focus on high precision and stability make it a reliable option for long-term climate monitoring. Challenges in data collection may include calibration needs and potential atmospheric interference, which are common to all infrared radiometers. However, the AATSR's design helps mitigate these issues to some extent.",

This data should then be processed to ensure the accuracy and stability needed for SST measurements, with a focus on achieving a precision of 0.3K. Further steps include ensuring proper radiometric calibration and considering additional processing or corrections for geometric distortions if necessary, since the data has not been geometrically corrected. This approach is part of a broader effort to monitor Earth's climate changes, leveraging the high precision and stability of AATSR's multi-channel infrared imaging capabilities.",
