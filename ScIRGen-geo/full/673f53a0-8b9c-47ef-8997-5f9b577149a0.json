            "description": "In this paper, we have systematically analyzed the chromium stable isotopes of the associated mantle minerals in 17 peridotite xenoliths from the northern part of the North China Craton by double diluent method, Neptune MC-ICP-MS and Triton tims. The experiments were carried out in the Key Laboratory of crust mantle materials and environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of science and technology of China CR isotopic compositions of major minerals in clinopyroxene rich lherzolites and exfoliated peridotites, of which the latter two types may have been subjected to melt / fluid metasomatism. These minerals show a large range of variation: olivine δ 53Cr is -0.43 ± 03 ‰ (2sd) to 0.09 ‰ ± 02 ‰ (2sd), clinopyroxene δ 53Cr is -0.32 ± 0.02 ‰ (2sd) to 0.14 ‰ ± 02 ‰ (2sd), orthopyroxene δ 53Cr is -0.32 ± 0.04 ‰ (2sd) to 0.19 ‰ ± 02 ‰ (2sd), and spinel δ 53Cr is -0.33 ± 0.06 ‰ (2sd) to 0.23 ‰ ± 0.02‰（2SD）。 Among them, we think that the Chromium Isotope results of different mineral pairs of lherzolite (for example, in 870 ° C to 970 ° C, Δ 53crspl ol 0.153 ‰ to 0.16 ‰, Δ 53crspl py ranges from 0.04 ‰ to 0.11 ‰, Δ 53crpy ol, ranging from 0.05 ‰ to 0.10 ‰), recorded a measurable and systematic inter mineral equilibrium CR isotope fractionation, which is consistent with the determination of CR2 in minerals by XANES+/ Σ The CR values predicted by the model are in good agreement with each other. The fractionation values can basically explain the CR isotopic behavior during partial melting and magmatic crystallization observed in peridotites and basalts of the moon. In contrast, we found that metasomatism may affect the CR isotopic composition of minerals in clinopyroxene rich lherzolites and exfoliated peridotites metasomatized in Beiyan area by means of mineral melt interaction and / or dynamic diffusion, resulting in the imbalance of Cr isotopic fractionation among minerals.\nOur findings confirm the equilibrium fractionation coefficient between high temperature minerals and its quantitative relationship with oxygen fugacity environment, which is of great significance for the study of oxygen fugacity environment of planetary evolution by using CR isotope system in the future.",

The calculated inter-mineral isotope fractionation factors (Δ53Cr) are also presented. The values following in parentheses are the Cr2+/ΣCr values in minerals for calculations. \nTable 5:  Representative electron microprobe analyses (wt.%) of major minerals from two Beiyan peridotite xenoliths.\nTable 6:  Major (wt.%) and trace element (ppm) compositions of Opx profiles from lherzolites Cl09-62 and Cl09-73.\nTable 7: Parameters for modelling partial melting (PM) peridotite and fractional crystallization (FC) of basaltic magma, including mineral modes, melting/crystallization reactions (melting from Walter (2003) and fractional crystallization from Roeder et al. (2006)), and Cr2+ and Cr3+ partition coefficients (Mallmann and O’Neill, 2009). Notably, Cr concentration of Spl in the partial melting model is set to ~6wt.% to approach that in the primitive mantle (Dick and Bullen, 1984), whereas this value is set to ~10wt.% for Spl due to its higher Cr# (Cr/(Cr+Al)) value crystallized from a MORB melt (Roeder et al. 2006).\nTable 8:  Ionic model parameters and Cr isotope fractionation factor calculations\n\nFigure 1: Plot (a) presents the normalized Cr K-edge XANES spectra for Ol separates from two lherzlites Cl09-65, Cl09-74, one Cpx-rich lherzolite CLB05-15 and one wehrlite Cl09-86, as well as the spectra for the Cr metal (zero-valent Cr) and Cr(OH)3 (trivalent Cr) standards; Plot (b) presents the corresponding derivative spectra. Plots (c) and (e) present the normalized Cr K-edge XANES spectra for Cpx and Opx, as well as Spl from the lherzolites and Cpx-rich lherzolites, respectively, while Plot (d) and (f) present the corresponding derivative spectra. The integral range used to determine the area of the 1s→4s peaks in the derivative spectra is also shown by the gray area. The reference standards in (a) and (b) for Ol minerals are the Cr2+-bearing ureilite Ol (Cr2+/ΣCr=0.95) and the Cr3+ feldspar-pyroxene (Fs-Pl) silicate glass (Cr2+/ΣCr=0) from Bell et al. (2014), while the standards in (c) and (d) for Py minerals are two feldspar-pyroxene (Fs-Py) silicate glass with Cr2+/ΣCr values of 0 and 1 from Berry et al. (2004) and Bell et al. (2014). The Spl standard is derived from the chromite (Cr2+/ΣC=0) from Eeckhout et al. (2007) in (e) and (f).\nFigure 2:  Concentration zoning of individual Opx grains from Cl09-62 and Cl09-73 for Cr (a) and Al2O3 (b) and Al2O3-Cr correlations for the five Opx profiles (c). Each distance interval for adjacent two points was approximately ~100µm.\nFigure 3:  Crystal structures for Cr-bearing Spl, Cpx, Opx, and Ol displaying nearest neighbors for Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions. The structures were built using CrystalMaker software based on the effective ionic radii for Cr species with different coordination environments (0.8 Å for 6-coordinated Cr2+ and 0.615 Å for 6-coordinated Cr3+) reported by Shannon (1976). Oxygen is shown as large red spheres in all structures, and the small, dark blue spheres represent silicon ions. The orange spheres and the light blue spheres represent the sites for trivalent ions and bivalent ions, respectively. The 4-coordinated, 6-coordinated, and 8-coordinated Cr-O bonds are shown in black, yellow, and purple, respectively. It is noteworthy that Cr2+ can substitute in distorted octahedral M2 positions with 6- to 8-coordination in the Cpx and Opx structures.\nFigure 4:  Calculated inter-mineral equilibrium Cr isotope fractionation factors at different temperatures: (a) δ53CrSpl-δ53CrOl, (b) δ53CrSpl-δ53CrPy, and (c) δ53CrPy-δ53CrOl based on the ionic model. The lines in different colors represent the estimations for the inter-mineral fractionation factors based on different Cr2+/ΣCr values of each mineral, which are expressed as the values following the mineral names in all plots. The filled and open symbols represent Opx-related and Cpx-related mineral pairs, respectively. The dashed and dotted curves in (a) represent calculated equilibrium fractionation factors using XANES-determined Cr valences of Spl and Ol. The dashed and dotted curves in (b) and (c) are calculated equilibrium fractionation factors fitting the observed values by adjusting the Cr2+/ΣCr ratios of Py. Uncertainties quoted for Δ53Cr in this and all subsequent figures are the square root of the sum of the square of the uncertainty of the two minerals.\nFigure 5: ‘δ-δ’ plots showing the isotope fractionation between minerals in Beiyan mantle xenoliths. Error bars for δ53Cr of minerals in this and all subsequent figures are 2SD uncertainties defined in the main text. Solid lines represent the equilibrium fractionation lines defined by the mineral pairs of four lherzolites (see the text for a detailed discussion). \nFigure 6:  Plot (a) presents Cr isotope compositions of individual minerals as a function of Fe/Mg mole ratios of these minerals in the Cpx-rich lherzolites. Plot (b) presents the correlations between Cr isotope fractionation values of Py-Ol mineral pairs and Fe/Mg mole ratios of corresponding Py for the lherzolties and Cpx-rich lherzolties. Plot (c) and (d) displays the correlations of δ53CrOl, Δ53CrCpx-Ol and the Ca/Al ratios of Cpx from the Beiyan peridotites, respectively. Plot (e) presents the positive correlation of the Mg isotope and Cr isotope compositions of Ol from the wehrlites, indicating kinetic diffusion effects rather than the mineral–melt mixing. The δ26MgOl data in (e) are from Xiao et al. (2013). The filled and open symbols in (a) - (e) represent Opx-related and Cpx-related minerals or mineral pairs, respectively. The dotted line in (e) is the calculated diffusion curve according to the model by Richter et al. (1999, 2003).\nFigure 7:  Plot (a) represents variations of the Cr isotope fractionation between residual solid and melt as a function of melt fraction (F), and initial oxygen fugacities following the non-modal melting model from Sossi and O’Neill (2017) in both batch and fractional melting scenarios. The starting material has a composition of a fertile Spl-facies lherzolite (60% Ol, 24% Opx, 15% Cpx and 1% Spl in volume). The numbers in parentheses are the Cr3+/ΣCr values in the initial peridotites summed over each minerals. In the case of F=0.1, the two melting scenarios with initial Cr3+/ΣCr values of 0.42, 0.56 and 0.85 (all other parameters are kept constant) would generate mafic melts with Cr3+/ΣCr of 0.13-0.15, 0.21-0.24 and 0.55-0.6, corresponding to oxygen fugacities of ~IW, ~IW+1.2 and ~IW+3.8 at 1400 °C (Berry et al., 2006), respectively, which cover the oxygen fugacity range covering most terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions [e.g., basaltic melts from Moon (IW-2 to IW), from Mars (IW to IW+2), from Earth (IW+2 to IW+6), Papike et al. (2005)]. Plot (b) represents variations of the Cr isotope fractionation between crystalized phase (consisting of Ol and Spl/Chromite in 99:1 volume ratio) and melt as a function of melt fraction (F) and initial oxygen fugacities during partial crystallization of a basaltic magma. The values in parentheses are the Cr3+/ΣCr values (0.2, 0.6 and 0.8) in the initial MORB-like melts with oxygen fugacities of IW+0.9, IW+4 and IW+5.7 (Berry et al., 2006), respectively.",
