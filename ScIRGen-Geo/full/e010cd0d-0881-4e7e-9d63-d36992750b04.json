            "description": "This is the water-balance-based evapotranspiration (ETwb) dataset for 56 large (> 105 km2) river basins of the world over the 1983–2016 period. Specifically, ETwb = Prec − Q – dS, where Prec, Q, and dS (all in mm yr−1) are basin-averaged annual precipitation, runoff, and the change in terrestrial water storage, respectively. For each basin, the observed Q at the hydrological station, four different Prec (GPCC, CRU, MSWEP, GPCP), and three types of dS (JPL, GSFC, CSR) estimates are used, yielding altogether 12 annual ETwb time-series. An optimally merged ETwb time-series is eventually produced using the Bayesian-based three-cornered hat method for each basin, which is probably the most appropriate one for benchmarking ET models. ",
            "descriptionCn": "本数据集为基于水量平衡方法的全球56个典型大河流域（面积>100000 km2）实际蒸散发数据。数据时间跨度为1983-2016，分辨率为逐年。本数据基于水文站观测的径流、4个降水产品（GPCC、CRU、MSWEP和GPCP）和3种水储量变化数据（JPL、GSFC和CSR的GRACE/GRACE-REC）计算得到，且降水产品考虑了误差订正。",
            "instructions": "The data include two main folders “ETwb_Data” and “River_Basin_Boundary”:\n1.     ETwb_Data\n The “ETwb_Data” folder contains two sub-folders called “ETwb_12Members” and “ETwb_BTCH_Merged”, respectively. All data are for 56 basins over the 1983–2016 period. Please see the Table 1 below for the Basin ID (e.g., Basin_1, Basin_2…Basin_56) shown in the first line of each Excel file.\n(1)      The “ETwb_12Members” sub-folder contains 12 Excel files named in the format of ETwb_PrecType_dSType, in which PrecType represents precipitation from GPCC/ CRU/MSWEP/GPCP and dSType represents dS from JPL/GSFC/CSR.\n(2)      The “ETwb_BTCH_Merged” sub-folder contains the optimally merged ETwb of the 12 members using the Bayesian-based three-cornered hat method. This data is recommended as the benchmark for validating/calibrating global ET models.\n2.     River_Basin_Boundary\nThe “River_Basin_Boundary” folder contains two sub-folders called “ShapeFile” and “netCDF”, respectively. Both are for the boundary of 56 river basins. You may choose any of them for use in processing the gridded data.\n(1)      The “ShapeFile” sub-folder contains the shape files of the river basin boundary, which could be used in the ArcGIS software. The detailed information is shown in the “Attribute Table”. The “Basin ID” in the “Attribute Table” is identical with that in the Figure 1 and Table 1. This ShapeFile is recommended for users who are familiar with ArcGIS.\n(2)      The “NetCDF” sub-folder contains the river basin boundary in the NetCDF format (River_Basin_Mask_56.nc). This basin mask data is at 0.25°, which is appropriate for processing any gridded data with geographical coordinates. The Integer in this NetCDF file ranges from 1 to 56 that is same with the Basin ID in Figure 1 and Table 1. This NetCDF file is recommended for users who prefer to use self-programming to process the data.",
