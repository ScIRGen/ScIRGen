            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Qinghai Lake integrated observatory network obtained from phenology camera observation data of the Alpine meadow and grassland ecosystem Superstation from May 1 in 2019 to December 31 in 2019. The site (98°35′41.62″E, 37°42′11.47″N) was located in the alpine meadow and alpine grassland ecosystem, near the SuGe Road in Tianjun County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3718m. The phenology camera adopts a vertical downward method to collect data, with the resolution of 2592*1944. Phenology photos in this data set were taken at 12:10 a day, which has a time error of ±10 min. The image is named as BSDCJZ BEIJING_IR_Year_Month_Day_Time.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
                "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

                    "Answer": "The successful application of the TSEB model was facilitated by improvements in estimating soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, fractional vegetation coverage, and surface component temperatures. The model's requirement for only a single measurement of land surface temperature while using the surface energy balance also contributed to its wide applicability across various vegetation types, climates, and spatial scales.",

                    "Answer": "Accurate soil and vegetation component temperatures, obtained from high-precision thermal infrared cameras, enable the separation of latent fluxes of soil and vegetation components. Validation of the TSEB model with stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope techniques and ground-based measurements further supports the reliable estimation of these fluxes, even in strongly advection-irrigated agricultural areas.",

                    "Answer": "In arid regions, the current composite temperature separation approaches are limited in effectiveness, leading to errors, as image classification errors affect the estimation of soil and canopy temperatures. These errors, along with uncertainties in atmospheric radiation and transmittance, contribute to inaccurate estimations of evapotranspiration.",

                    "Answer": "In irrigated agricultural areas, achieving energy balance closure is challenging due to the incomplete measurement of energy fluxes like H and LE, which can be influenced by the strong advective environment. The uncertainty in surface-air temperature differences further complicates the accuracy of these measurements.",

                    "Answer": "The methodology involves using phenological cameras with vertically downward data acquisition at high resolutions. The consistent timing of image capture (around 12:10 daily) and specific naming conventions for images suggest a structured approach to data collection. This can enhance the quality and reliability of datasets by providing consistent and high-resolution data, though it requires careful management of time discrepancies within ±10 minutes.",
