The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018/8/31 10:30.",

                    "Answer": "Factors leading to challenges in data quality and accuracy include the harsh and variable weather conditions in mountainous regions, which can affect sensor performance and data transmission. The complexity of the terrain can also lead to difficulties in sensor placement and maintenance, potentially causing data gaps or erroneous readings. Additionally, the calibration of sensors and proper installation at various heights and depths, as described in the metadata, are crucial to obtaining accurate measurements, and any discrepancies in these processes could lead to errors.",

                    "Answer": "In a comprehensive meteorological observation system within a temperate grassland region, multiple sensor layers are integrated by installing sensors at different heights (3m, 5m, 10m) for wind speed and direction, as well as air temperature and humidity. Additional instruments like barometers, rain gauges, radiometers, infrared thermometers, soil heat flux plates, soil temperature probes, and soil moisture sensors are strategically placed at specified depths and orientations. The integration involves ensuring the sensors face specific directions (e.g., true north or south) and are set at precise distances from the observation tower. Data collection is processed through a series of quality control steps, such as ensuring consistent data intervals, marking missing data, removing duplicates, and flagging questionable data to maintain data integrity.",

                    "Answer": "Due to the complexity and variability of the terrain, different factors such as wind patterns, temperature gradients, and soil composition can affect the accuracy and consistency of data collection across different heights and depths. Ensuring data quality might involve regular calibration of sensors, addressing data gaps marked with placeholders like -6999, and removing data that significantly deviates from expected physical ranges or instrument limits.",
