            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Sidaoqiao Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2021. The site (101.137° E, 42.001° N) was located on a tamarix (Tamarix chinensis Lour.) surface in the Sidaoqiao, Dalaihubu Town, Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The elevation is 873 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HC2S3; 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 28 m, towards north), wind speed profile (010C; 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 28 m, towards north), wind direction profile (020C; 15 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; in waterproof box), rain gauge (TE525M; 28 m, towards south), four-component radiometer (CNR4; 10 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 10 m, towards south, vertically downward), two photosynthetically active radiation (PQS-1; 10 m, towards south, one vertically upward and one vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFP01SC; 3 duplicates with G1 below the tamarix; G2 and G3 between plants, -0.06 m), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (installed on 17 July, 2013, TCAV; -0.02, -0.04 m), soil temperature profile (109ss-L; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2.0 m), and soil moisture profile (install on 7 December, 2013, ML2X; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2.0 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m, Ta_7 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m, Ta_20 m and Ta_28 m; RH_5 m, RH_7 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m, RH_20 m and RH_28 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_5 m, Ws_7 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m, Ws_20 m and Ws_28 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_15 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_up and PAR_down) (μmol/ (s m^-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, Ts_160 cm, Ts_200 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, Ms_160 cm, Ms_200 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2021-9-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al.

                "Arid and semiarid regions represent approximately 30 % of the global terrestrial surface area (Dregne, 1991; Scanlon et al., 2006), and dryland expansion occurs under climate change, especially in developing countries (Huang et al., 2016). An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

Understanding the basic characteristics of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert ecosystems is important to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the oasis–desert area and support the ecological security and sustainable development of the oasis. A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."

Half-hourly turbulent flux data were acquired by an eddy covariance system and scintillometer. The hydrometeorological data (including radiation, soil heat flux, and soil temperature profiles; gradients of air temperature and humidity and of wind speed and direction; and air pressure, precipitation, and soil moisture profiles) were observed from automatic weather stations with a 10 min average period as well as the groundwater table data. Moreover, vegetation and soil parameters were also supplemented in the datasets.
