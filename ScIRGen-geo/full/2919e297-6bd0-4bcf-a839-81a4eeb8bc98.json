                "The Himalaya-Hindu-Kush and Tibetan Plateau, which are collectively referred to as the Third Pole (TP), contain the largest ice mass on the planet outside of the polar regions. Unlike the Arctic and Antarctic regions, the TP is situated in a mid-latitude location and is located in the immediate vicinity of densely populated and industrialized regions. Of particular importance is its proximity to two countries (China and India) that emit the most climate-warming black carbon (BC) aerosols. Therefore, the TP is considered to be one of the most vulnerable regions to effects of BC aerosols. The long-range transport to and deposition of BC aerosols in the TP is attracting considerable attention because of BC’s effects on the transformation of hydrological and radiative forcing in the East and South Asian regions. In addition, BC aerosols are believed to play a considerable role in the melting of mid-latitude glaciers because of both the heating of aloft air masses transported into the TP and the albedo effects of deposited BC. Studies based on global chemical-transport models have yielded varying predictions of source region contributions, suggesting that BC deposited on TP glaciers stems from heavily polluted regions on the Indian subcontinent and/or from East Asia. However, these models are uncertain with respect to source-area emissions and air transport patterns across the highly elevated topographical mountain features of the TP. Emissions inventories are severely challenged in terms of particle emissions from incomplete combustion (for example, BC), especially for sources characterized by poor levels of combustion efficiency. Such sources are prevalent in South and East Asia and include the open combustion of garbage and crop residues, the use of brick kilns and household cooking/heating with firewood, and the burning of animal dung and coal briquettes. Fossil fuel-sourced BC appears to have approximately twice the particle-specific warming potential of biomass-sourced BC."

                "To address these uncertainties, the dual-carbon-isotope (D14C and d13C) fingerprint of BC, which is diagnostic for fossil fuel vs biomass combustion and for source regions, was investigated using aerosol and glacier snowpit samples collected from the hitherto most extensive geographical collection of BC observations on the southern, central and northern mountain chains of the TP. The combined D14C-d13C fingerprint of BC was used to identify the sources of BC to the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau with respect to both source regions and the relative importance of different combustion source classes."

            "challenges": [
                "However, these models are uncertain with respect to source-area emissions and air transport patterns across the highly elevated topographical mountain features of the TP. Because of the TP’s overall inaccessibility, in situ BC aerosol observations for the region are lacking, as are data on carbon isotopic compositions, which have recently been proven useful for quantitatively constraining sources of BC. Furthermore, the limited comparisons of model-simulated and measured BC concentrations in the TP are not in good agreement; these differences may be attributable to several causes, including uncertain emissions inventories, the complicated effects of topographic transport steering, and source-related differences in the scavenging of different BC source types. Emissions inventories are severely challenged in terms of particle emissions from incomplete combustion (for example, BC), especially for sources characterized by poor levels of combustion efficiency."

Furthermore, snowpit samples from eight glaciers were obtained from a region spanning from the Himalayas in the south to the Qilian Mountains in the northeastern TP. The elemental carbon (EC) component, which is the common chemical/mass definition of BC, was isolated from each sample via thermal-optical analysis, and evolved CO2 was purified online and collected using a cryo-trap."

The fossil fuel contributions to BC in the snowpits of the inner TP are lower (30±10%), implying contributions from internal Tibetan sources (for example, yak dung combustion)."
