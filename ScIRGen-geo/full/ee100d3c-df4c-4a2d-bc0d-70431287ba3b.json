            "description": "The forest hydrology experimental area of Heihe River integrated remote sensing experiment includes the dense observation area of Dayekou basin and the dense observation area of Pailugou basin. Due to the concentrated distribution of the fixed sample plots in the drainage ditch basin, these sample plots lack of representativeness to the forest of the whole dayokou basin, so in June 2008, 43 temporary forest sample plots were set up in the whole dayokou basin. The data set is the ground observation data of the 43 temporary plots. In addition to the measurement and recording of stand status and site factors, Lai was also observed. \nThe instruments used to measure each wood in the sample plot are mainly tape, DBH, flower pole, tree measuring instrument and compass. The DBH, tree height, height under branch, crown width in cross slope direction, crown width along slope direction and single tree growth were measured for each tree. WGS84 latitude and longitude coordinates of the center point of the sample plot were measured with different hand-held GPS, and the positioning error was about 5-30m. Other observation factors include: Forest Farm, slope direction, slope position, slope, soil thickness, canopy density, etc. The implementation time of these temporary sample plots is from 2 to 30 June 2008. \nThe data set can provide ground data for the development of remote sensing inversion algorithm of forest structure parameters.",
