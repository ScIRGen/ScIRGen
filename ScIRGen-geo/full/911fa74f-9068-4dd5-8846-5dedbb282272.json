                "The Antarctic ice shelf system is an important area connecting the ice sheets and the ocean. Its stability is closely related to the Antarctic mass balance. Iceberg calving, the shedding of ice from glaciers or ice shelf frontal edges, is the main process contributing to the dynamic mass loss from the ice sheet to the ocean. Iceberg calving accounts for half of the net mass loss of the Antarctic ice shelves. Although iceberg calving plays an important role in the Antarctic ice shelf mass balance, the majority of the current ice sheet and ocean climate models do not represent the calving process in a physically realistic manner. Understanding this process is critical for accurately predicting the future impact of climate change on ice sheets. Currently, extensive and detailed iceberg calving observations are time-consuming and laborious. This is mainly because of the massive volume of high-resolution remotely sensed data and the lack of efficient extraction methods. This has led to a paucity of continuous monitoring of calving events at the continental scale."

            "challenges": [
                "The difficulties in the precise monitoring of iceberg calving lie with the coexistence of ice shelf advances and calving. The manual location of iceberg calving is time-consuming and painstaking, while achieving precise extraction has mostly relied on the surface textural characteristics of the ice shelves and the quality of the images. However, observing iceberg calving is much more complicated than monitoring changes in the coastline. This is because the expansion of the ice shelves coexists with the calving events, but the changes in the coastline can only reflect the overall advance or retreat of the coastline. This method requires repeated comparisons between the frontal edges in two temporal images to check whether calving has occurred, which is time-consuming and laborious. Moreover, the image matching method for high-precision monitoring is quite demanding in terms of the image’s quality and texture coherence before and after calving."

After the calibration and terrain correction, we chose the Antarctica polar stereographic projections and resampled to a 75 m resolution. We automatically extracted and manually modified the coastline vector for August 2015 as the original coastline benchmark, using an updated version of the Canny edge detection algorithm. We converted the benchmark ice shelf polygon vertices into points and recorded their order. Then, the following operations were carried out for each point. First, we judged whether the point was on the grounding line or not. Next, based on the velocity of each coastline point, we identified its movement and new location. After joining the points to the line, a new coastline was derived, namely the simulated coastline. By comparing the simulated ice shelf polygon to its contemporaneous images and by correcting the frontal edge of the ice shelf, so that it fits into the actual coastline position, we can obtain the exact ice shelf polygon for the following year. By subtracting the corrected ice shelf polygons from the theoretical simulated polygons, we obtained calved-area polygons during that year."
