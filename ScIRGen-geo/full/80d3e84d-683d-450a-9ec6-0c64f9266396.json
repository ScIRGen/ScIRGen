            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with MODIS was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jun. 22, 2008. Simultaneous east-west ground measurements on the canopy temperature, the half-height temperature and the land surface radiative temperature were carried out by the hand-held infrared thermometer at intervals of 125m in 8 quadrates (2km×2km), No.1 quadrate (H01-H08) on Jun. 22, No.2 quadrate (H09-H16) on Jun. 23,No.3 quadrate (H17-H24) on Jun. 22, No.4 quadrat (H25-H32) on Jun. 23, No.5 quadrate  (H33-H40) on Jun. 22, No.6 quadrate (H41-H48) on Jun. 23, No,7 quadrate (H49-H56) and No.8 quadrate (H57-H64) on Jun. 23. \n    Data were archived in Excel format.
