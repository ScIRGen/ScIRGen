            "description": "(1) Landsat alpine timberline product data set in mountainous areas of southwest China;  (2) 136 scenes of Landsat 5TM and Landsat 8 OLI data in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015, with the decision tree to distinguish between forest and non-forest in Landsat. Furthermore, we removed alpine timberlines that had an elevation of less than 3000 m and that was less than 50 m from surface peaks. The physical boundary between forest land and non-forest (shrub and meadow) pixels in the final classification was then taken as marking the alpine timberline. (3) The overall classification accuracy of forest land and non-forest land based on Landsat image is 93.47%, and the accuracy of alpine timberline verified based on GF-2 image is ± 8.54 m; (4) It will help to enhance the understanding of the link between forest vegetation and climate change under extreme conditions.",
