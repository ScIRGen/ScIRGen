Through the continuous snow samples from November 2016 to April 2017 in Altay area, the data of DOC, TN and BC of snow in kuwei station in Altay area were obtained through the experimental analysis and test with the instrument. The time resolution was weeks and the ablation period was daily. 1. Unit: Doc and TN unit μ g-1 (PPM), BC unit ng g-1 (ppb), MAC unit M2 g-1",

                    "Answer": "'阿勒泰地区雪冰吸光性杂质数据' refers to a dataset that includes information on light-absorbing impurities found in snow and ice in the Altay region. These impurities, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and black carbon (BC), are important because they can effectively absorb ultraviolet and near-ultraviolet solar radiation, which in turn accelerates snow and ice melt. The data was collected from snow samples in the Altay region from November 2016 to April 2017, with weekly time resolution for regular accumulation periods and daily resolution during melt periods.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods, which include weekly measurements during regular conditions and daily measurements during the melting period, suggest a focus on understanding how impurities such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and black carbon (BC) contribute to snow and ice melt. These impurities can absorb ultraviolet and near-ultraviolet solar radiation, accelerating melting processes. Therefore, the data might indicate the extent to which these impurities influence melt dynamics and potentially impact local and regional climate conditions.",

These samples were analyzed using specific instruments to measure dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and black carbon (BC) concentrations. The DOC and TN were measured in units of μg g-1 (ppm), while BC was measured in ng g-1 (ppb). Additionally, the mass absorption cross-section (MAC) was measured in m2 g-1. The data had a weekly time resolution during the accumulation period and daily during the melting period.",
