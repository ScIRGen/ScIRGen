            "description": "The dataset compiled 11 leaf traits in 468 species (mainly herbs and shrubs) at 336 sampling sites on the surface and the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, including leaf thickness, leaf dry weight, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry-matter content, leaf water content, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf mass per area, leaf carbon, leaf nitrogen and leaf phosphorus content. The geographical coordinates, bioclimatic indicators, interference intensity and vegetation types of each sampling site were also recorded. These data were directly obtained by the research team from 2018 to 2021 through field plot investigation, leaf collection and trait measurement. These data could provide solid data support for effectively quantifying the modern ecological features of alpine ecosystems, further evaluating the response of alpine ecosystem to climate change and human disturbances and improving the next-generation vegetation model. It could be a great contribution to the regional and global plant trait databases.",

                "Functional trait databases are emerging as a crucial tool for a wide range of ecological studies, including next-generation vegetation modelling across the world. However, few large-scale studies have been reported on plant traits in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the cradle of East Asian flora and fauna with specific alpine ecosystems, and no report on plant trait databases could be found. Plant traits of morphological, anatomical, physiological and phenological characteristics respond to changes in the living environment, affect ecosystem functions and drive species coexistence under environmental constraints. Over the past 3 decades, a growing body of trait analyses has quantified the global and regional distribution patterns of key functional traits, such as leaf, seed size, plant height, wood, plant form and function, root and flower. Such studies have successfully linked plant traits with environmental changes, natural and anthropogenic disturbances and ecosystem functions. Findings from plant trait–environment–ecosystem function interaction could be further utilised to map the spatial pattern of plant traits, build the next generation of vegetation models, predict vegetation distribution and function and be incorporated into the Earth system model. New insights into ecosystem traits and the trait network are bridging multiple dimensions of biology, macroecology and geoscience. All these works require global and regional plant trait databases, such as the TRY, Growth-Form, Global Inventory of Floras and Traits, Fine-Root, GRoot and tundra traits and the Plant Trait for Mediterranean Basin Species (BROT), China traits, AusTraits and LT-Brazil. However, the Earth still has undersampled regions. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) includes the two major regions of Qinghai Province and the Xizang Autonomous Region and partial areas from north-western Gansu Province, southern Xinjiang Autonomous Region, western Sichuan Province and north-western Yunnan Province in China and is also called the “Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau”. As the world’s “Third Pole”, the “Asia Water Tower” and the cradle of East Asian flora, the TP is the most underrepresented region in global and regional plant trait databases. The first version of the Chinese plant trait database does not contain data from the TP, and the global plant trait database TRY has only a few collections from various sources with non-systematic sampling. Field-based, local studies of plant functional traits on the TP have made some interesting advances. For example, Luo et al. (2005) linked the plant traits with ecosystem functions, He et al. (2006) explored the influencing factors on plant traits, Geng et al. (2014) quantified the patterns of plant trait correlations between above- and below-ground components, Wang et al. (2020) compared their work with the global dataset, and Xu et al. (2021) analysed the mechanism of plant trait variation along the altitude pattern. However, such works, where the sampling sites have been mostly along the main roads in the eastern TP, were also limited. Plant trait records from the central to western TP are extremely rare. However, the TP has the richest temperate alpine flora and the most abundant plant diversity in the world. It was also an evolutionary cradle for the herbaceous genera of China. The uplift of the TP and its unique alpine vegetation are important to the monsoon climate system and vegetation of East Asia and regional and global climate change studies. As the largest and highest plateau in the world, the TP has not only changed the regional and global climate system, geological structure, topography and hydrology, but has also influenced the evolution of the flora, fauna and biodiversity strongly. It has 8876 vascular species from 1371 genera and 211 families, including 6475 herbaceous and 2401 woody plants, of which 1706 were endemic to the TP, and has three biodiversity hotspots of the world. Vegetation changes from south-east to north-west, from lowland broad-leaved evergreen forests, including tropical rainforest and subtropical evergreen forest, montane mixed evergreen and deciduous forest, subalpine conifer forest to alpine shrubland, meadow, steppe and desert along an annual precipitation gradient from ca. 3000 to 50 mm. In physiognomy, the unique alpine vegetation looks similar to the arctic tundra but has different species composition. The plateau has amplified changes in climates, and rapid climate change has led to profound changes in alpine species and ecosystems. Plant traits, as the link amongst species, environment and ecosystem functions, are the best tools to study the impacts of climate change on vegetation."

            "research objective": [
                "In this work, a TP leaf trait dataset (TiP-Leaf) was established, and 11 leaf traits from 468 species of 1692 leaf samples were collected from 336 sites across five of the six vegetation types on the TP. The dataset could provide solid data support to effectively quantify the modern ecological features of alpine ecosystems, thereby further evaluating the response of alpine ecosystems to climate change and human disturbances and improving the next-generation vegetation model. This dataset is not only an update of the Chinese plant trait database, but is also a great contribution to the global trait database. Therefore, the establishment of the TP plant trait database and further analysis of plant trait–environment–ecosystem function relationships are of great significance to understanding the future change and sustainable development of the unique alpine vegetation on the roof of the world."

            "challenges": [
                "However, the dataset also presents some unavoidable limitations. For example, the establishment of sampling sites and the judgment of dominant and common species are mostly subjective. The leaves of some plants are extremely small, resulting in incomplete recognition when scanning the LA. Due to harsh field conditions, measuring the plant traits in time occasionally becomes impossible. Preventing some leaves from losing too much water to withering is still inevitable, although we have taken protective measures for the leaves. Inadequate collection of some leaf samples results in fewer data of plant chemical element content than that of morphological traits. In any case, performing large-scale collection of plant traits on the TP, which requires a lot of manpower and material resources as well as overcoming the adverse environment of high altitude and extreme variability, is not easy."
            ],
            "methods": [
                "The leaf traits of the dominant and common plant species of the TP distributed mostly across the plateau surface were sampled and measured from July to August in the summer of 2018–2021. Vegetation surveys were conducted in four regions, namely the source area of the Three Rivers in Qinghai Province in the north-eastern TP (2018), the southern Xizang Autonomous Region in the south-eastern and central TP (2019), Ngari Prefecture in the north-western TP and the Qaidam Basin of the north-eastern TP (2020), and the Qilian Mountains, the Altun Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains in the northern margin of the TP, passing through the southern margin of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Autonomous Region (2021). Considering the zonal vegetation types and the precipitation gradient, 336 sites were selected to investigate the vegetation with less grazing and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrubby and herbaceous vegetation was mainly selected (332 sites) along with the forest vegetation at the four sites (but removed for further analysis). At each site, one to three plots were set up to survey the species composition, abundance, coverage and plant height. The plot areas for herbaceous vegetation, shrubby vegetation and forest vegetation were 1 m ×1 m, 2 m×2 m or 5 m ×5 m and 10 m×10 m, respectively. Geographical locations, natural and human disturbances, and vegetation types were also recorded. The dominant and common plant species at each site were determined by visual inspection, the leaf samples of these plants were picked up, and the leaf traits were measured. At each site, two to three mature and disease-free complete leaves from each individual of dominant and common plant species were collected, and at least 30 individuals were selected to meet the needs of trait measurement and element analysis. When the single leaf was small, microphyllous or leptophyllous, 100–200 leaves were picked. In total, 11 leaf functional traits (e.g. leaf thickness, LT; fresh weight, FW; dry weight, DW; leaf dry-matter content, LDMC; leaf water content, LWC; leaf area, LA; specific leaf area, SLA; leaf mass per area, LMA; leaf carbon content, LCC; leaf nitrogen content, LNC; leaf phosphorus content, LPC) were measured and calculated on the basis of the handbook of standardised measurement for plant functional traits worldwide. LT (mm) was measured on the sampling day by using Vernier callipers with an accuracy of 0.01 mm. The thickness in the middle of the vein and margin of each leaf was measured, and then the average of the five leaves was taken as the LT of a species. In addition to LT, 20–30 leaves for normal-leaved plants and 100–200 leaves for small- to leptophyll-leaved plants were generally selected for other trait variable measurements. FW (g) was obtained by weighing with a 1 /100 electronic balance. Subsequently, the fresh leaves were oven dried at 75 ◦C for 48–72 h to obtain the DW (g). LDMC was measured as follows: LDMC (g g−1) =DW/FW. LA (cm 2) was measured using a scanner (EPSON Perfection V 700 Photo Scanner) and software (WinFOLIA Pro, Canada). SLA and LMA were measured as follows: SLA (cm2 g−1) =LA/DW and LMA (g m −2) =DW/LA ×104. The dried leaves were further used for chemical analysis. LCC (mg g−1), LNC (mg g−1) and LPC (mg g−1) were determined by the outside-temperature hot potassium dichromate oxidation–volumetric method, the distillation–titration method and the vanadium molybdate yellow colorimetric method, respectively."

                "In this work, an extensive dataset of 11 leaf functional traits (TiP-Leaf), mainly for herbs and shrubs and a few trees on the TP, was compiled through field surveys. The TiP-Leaf dataset, which was compiled from 336 sites distributed mainly on the plateau surface and the northern margin of the TP across alpine and temperate vegetation regions and sampled from 2018 to 2021, contained 1692 morphological trait measurements of leaf thickness, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, leaf dry-matter content, leaf water content, leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf mass per area and 1645 chemical element trait measurements of leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Thus, 468 species that belong to 184 genera and 51 families were obtained and measured. In addition to leaf trait measurements, the geographic coordinates, bioclimate variables, disturbance intensities and vegetation types of each site were also recorded. The dataset, which is available from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC; Jin et al., 2022a; https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.272516), can make a great contribution to the regional and global plant trait databases."
