            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with ALOS PALSAR was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jun. 27, 2008.\n    The data were in FBD mode and HH/HV polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 23:41 BJT. Observations were carried out in the reed plot A, the saline plot B, the alfalfa plot D and the barley plot E, which were divided into 6×6 subsites, with each one spanning a 120×120 m2 plot. Soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer were measured in A and B; the soil temperature, soil moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, and soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring in D and E.\n    Data were archived in Excel file. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",

                "Radar remote sensing has demonstrated its applicability to the retrieval of basin-scale soil moisture. The mechanism of radar backscattering from soils is complicated and strongly influenced by surface roughness. Surface soil moisture (mv) is important in agronomic, hydrological, and meteorological processes at all spatial scales. The ability of inferring mv using both active and passive microwave techniques has been intensively demonstrated. It is well known that space-borne microwave radiometers and scatterometers possess the advantage of high revisit capacity but are deficient in coarse spatial resolution. On the contrary, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have the capability to provide finer spatial resolution, on the order of tens of meters, meeting most spatial requirements for watershed management and hydrological applications. The advanced IEM (AIEM) improves the calculation accuracy of scattering coefficient by keeping the absolute phase term in Greens function which was neglected by IEM. In the IEM and AIEM, surface roughness is an essential input, thus, if only a single configuration (e.g., one polarization, one frequency) of radar data is available, roughness parameters should be known as a priori information in order to retrieve soil moisture using these models."

Then, the deduced roughness parameters were used for the retrieval of soil moisture in association with the AIEM. An evaluation of the proposed method was performed in an experimental area in the middle stream of the Heihe River Basin, where the Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (WATER) was taken place."

During the field campaigns conducted in the intensive observation period (IOP) from May to August 2008, five experimental sites (ESs), each 360 × 360 m 2 in size, were established.
