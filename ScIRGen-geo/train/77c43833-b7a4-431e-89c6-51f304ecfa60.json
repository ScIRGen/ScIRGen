            "description": "On 25 August 2012, a Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner boarded on the Y-12 aircraft was used to obtain LiDAR DSM point cloud data. Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner  has unlimited numbers of returns intensities measurements including the first, second, third return intensities. The wavelength of laser light is 1064 nm. The absolute flight altitude is 5200 m with the point cloud density 1 point per square meter. Aerial LiDAR-DSM was obtained through parameter calibration, automatic classification of point cloud density and manual editing.",

In this case, a Y-12 aircraft equipped with a Leica ALS70 LiDAR system was employed to conduct remote sensing over the core observation area in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The LiDAR system, featuring a wavelength of 1064 nanometers and supporting multiple returns (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and last), was flown at an absolute altitude of 5200 meters to achieve an average point cloud density of 1 point per square meter. This data collection method involved steps such as parameter calibration, automatic point cloud classification, and manual editing to produce final DEM and DSM data products.",
