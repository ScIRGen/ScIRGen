            "description": "This datasets include the spatial distribution multi-year means of the SOS and EOS from 2000 to 2018, and the temporal trends of the SOS and EOS from 1982 to 1999 and 2000 to 2020 across the Tibetan Plateau. Based on AVHRR NDVI, MODIS NDVI, and EVI, four steps were used to minimize bias and noise in SOS and EOS extracted from time series of vegetation indexes. First, pixels with multiple-year average vegetation indexes lower than a threshold are regarded as areas of low or no vegetation coverage and are excluded. The pixels with weak seasonality of greenness are also excluded. Second, values of vegetation indexes contaminated by snow cover, ice, or both in winter (December–early March) are substituted with the mean of non-contaminated, high-quality vegetation indexes values during winter. Third, remaining negative vegetation indexes bias caused by clouds and aerosols in other seasons is calibrated by a Savitzky–Golay filtering technique. Finally the improved annual time series of vegetation indexes is fitted to double logistic or modified double logistic functions. Based on thresholds and inflection-point, the SOS and EOS across the Tibetan Plateau were extracted. The spatial resolution of the datasets were 250m and 1/12°. The data quality is reliable.",

                    "Answer": "Both AVHRR NDVI and MODIS NDVI data collection methods involve a series of steps to minimize bias and noise. The process includes removing pixels with no or low vegetation cover, replacing winter vegetation index values affected by snow or ice with high-quality averages, calibrating negative biases caused by clouds and aerosols using the Savitzky-Golay method, and fitting annual vegetation index time series with double logistic or modified double logistic functions.

Additionally, the fitting of annual vegetation index time series using double logistic or modified double logistic functions plays a role, as well as the threshold and inflection point methods used for extracting growth season dates.",

Second, replace vegetation indices affected by snow, ice, or both during the winter months (December to early March) with the average of high-quality, uncontaminated winter vegetation indices. Third, correct negative deviations in vegetation indices caused by clouds and aerosols in other seasons using the Savitzky-Golay method. Finally, fit the annual vegetation index time series using a double logistic or modified double logistic function. The start and end dates of the growing season are extracted pixel by pixel using the method of thresholds and inflection points.",
