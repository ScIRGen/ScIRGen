      "description": "The quantitative evaluation and comprehensive measurement of resource and environment carrying capacity are the key technical links in the research of resource and environment carrying capacity from classification to synthesis. On the basis of the evaluation of the suitability of human settlements, the limitation of resource carrying capacity, and the socio-economic adaptability, a three-dimensional tetrahedron model for the comprehensive evaluation of resource and environment carrying capacity with balanced significance is constructed according to the research ideas and technical routes from classification to synthesis of the resource and environment carrying capacity of \"suitability zoning - restrictive classification - adaptive classification - warning classification\". Based on the 10km grid, a comprehensive study on resource and environment carrying capacity was carried out, and the resource and environment carrying index in Laos was quantitatively simulated. Taking 1 as the balance state, it provides support for the comprehensive evaluation of resource and environment carrying capacity in Laos.",
