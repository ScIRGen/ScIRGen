            "description": "Firstly, the canopy reflectance is expressed as a function of a series of parameters, such as Lai / fAPAR, wavelength, soil and leaf reflectance, aggregation index, incidence and observation angle. For several key parameters, the parameter table is established as the input of inversion. Then input the surface reflectance data and land cover data after preprocessing, and use the LUT method to retrieve the fAPAR products.
