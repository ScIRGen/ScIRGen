            "description": "The whole mitochondrial genomes of 68 Tibetan samples were sequenced by high-throughput second-generation sequencing. The average depth of sequencing was 1000 ×, ensuring that the mitochondrial genome of each sample was completely covered (100%). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we control the quality of these data to ensure that there is no sample pollution and other quality problems. According to the phylogenetic tree, each individual was allocated into haplogroups. The results showed that in Lhasa Tibetan population, M9a1c1b1a was the highest (19.12%), followed by G2 (13.23%), M13a (11.76%), C4a (7.35%), D4 (7.35%), A11a1a (5.88%), M9a1b (5.88%), and F1c, F1g, B4, F1d, M62b, F1a, F1b, G1, M11, M8a, U7a, Z3a. These haplogroups have different originations, including Paleolithic components (M13a, M62b, M9a1b, etc.), northern China millet farmers’ components (M9a1c1b1a and A11a1a), components distributed mainly in southern East Asia (F1a, etc.), northern East Asian haplogroups (C4a, D4, etc.). It is worth noting that the maternal component of Lhasa Tibetans is mainly composed of millet agricultural population in northern China, indicating the important impact of genetic input of millet agricultural population in northern China on the genetic structure of the population in this area. Taken together, the maternal genetic structure of Lhasa Tibetan population exhibits time stratification, which may represent the genetic imprint of different population entering the region in different periods.",

                "With an extreme and harsh environment that is generally considered inhospitable to humans, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has been inhabited since the late upper Pleistocene. In contrast to the earliest occupation by hunter-gatherers during the Late Paleolithic era, whose contribution to the current Tibetan gene pool was rather limited, migration onto the plateau appears to have occurred during the Neolithic period. Archaeological evidence further suggests that permanent human occupation began ∼3.6 kilo-years ago (ka), and was most likely facilitated by the introduction and utilization of cold-tolerant barley agriculture and sheep, which were first domesticated in west Asia around 10 ka. As revealed by archaeological evidence, modern humans settled extensively in the northeastern TP (below 2500 m above sea level (masl)) with millet cultivation around ∼5.2 ka, and further expanded to high-altitude plateau areas (above 2500 masl) ∼3.6 ka with barley and sheep from west Asia. According to previous genetic studies, most Tibetan genetic components can be traced back to Neolithic immigrations from northern China, raising the possibility that it was millet farmers who brought barley agriculture to the TP around 3.6 ka. Given the limited molecular resolution, and a lack of both genetic and archaeological evidence in previous studies, it remains unclear whether these lineages are associated with millet farmers or with the immigration of foragers during the early Holocene (∼11.7–8.3 ka)."

Blood samples from an additional 11 Chinese individuals belonging to haplogroups of interest were also collected for mitogenome sequencing. Complete mtDNA genomes of the samples were enriched by capture-based strategies using a MyGenostics Human Mitochondria Capture Kit (MyGenostics Inc., Beijing, China). Sequencing was carried out using an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform at MyGenostics. Quality control was performed according to previous research. The sequencing outputs were edited and aligned by Lasergene (DNAStar Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and compared with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence. Phylogenetic trees of lineages of interest were reconstructed manually based on the complete sequences and confirmed by mtphyl software. Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) for effective population size (Nef) through time were reconstructed based on 13 protein coding regions using BEAST v1.7.5. In detail, 20 samples were picked randomly from each of the 11 Tibetan populations and pooled as one data set to perform BSP analysis."

This suggests that the millet farmer lineages contributed to and existed in the proto-gene pool of Tibetans before their expansion to different regions on the TP. Indeed, much closer genetic affinity was observed among all regional Tibetan populations, with haplogroup M9a1a1c1b1a contributing most to this clustering pattern, implying that millet farmer components played an important role in shaping the genetic landscape of Tibetans."
