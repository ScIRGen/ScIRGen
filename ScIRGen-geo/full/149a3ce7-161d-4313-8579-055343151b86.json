            "description": "On 26 July 2012, Wide-angle Infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner (WIDAS) carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a visible near Infrared thermal Dual-mode airborne remote sensing experiment, which is located in the artificial oasis eco-hydrology experimental area (5×5 km). WIDAS includes a CCD camera with a spatial resolution of 0.2 m, a visible near Infrared multispectral camera with five bands scanner (an maximum observation angle 48° and spatial resolution 1 m), and a thermal image camera with a spatial resolution of 4.8 m.\nThe CCD camera data are recorded in DN values processed by mosaic and orthorectification.",
