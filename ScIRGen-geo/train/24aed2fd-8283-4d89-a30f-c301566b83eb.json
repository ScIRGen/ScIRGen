            "description": "Under a pronounced climate warming, permafrost has been degrading in most areas, but it is still unclear in the northwestern part of the Da Xing’anling Mountains, Northeast China. According to a ten-year observation of permafrost and active-layer temperatures, the multi-year average of mean annual ground temperatures at 20 m was -2.83, -0.94, -0.80, -0.70, -0.60 and -0.49 ℃, respectively, at Boreholes GH4, MG3, MG1, MG2, GH5 and YTLH2, with the depths of permafrost table varying from 1.1 to 7.0 m. Ground cooling at shallow depths has been detected, resulting in declining thaw depths in Yituli’he during 2009-2020, possibly due to relatively stable mean positive air temperature and declining snow cover and dwindling local population. In most study areas (e.g., Mangui and Genhe), permafrost warming is particularly pronounced at larger depths (even at 80 m). These results can provide important information for regional development and engineering design and maintenance.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods involved decade-long observations of permafrost and active layer temperatures using boreholes at various locations. These observations revealed a consistent cooling of shallow ground layers, potentially due to factors like stable mean positive air temperatures, decreased snow cover, and reduced local population, which might have contributed to the observed stability in certain areas.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in accurately measuring permafrost degradation in the northwestern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains arise from the complex interactions of several factors, including the unclear state of permafrost degradation, relative stability of average positive air temperatures, reduction in snow cover, and local population decrease. These factors influence ground temperature and thaw depth, as observed in boreholes like GH4, MG3, MG1, MG2, GH5, and YTLH2, where shallow ground cooling and changing thaw depths have been detected.",

This information could be crucial for understanding regional permafrost degradation trends and informing regional development, engineering design, and maintenance strategies.",

                    "Answer": "The objective of collecting ground temperature data from boreholes is to monitor and understand the extent of permafrost degradation in the northwest of the Greater Khingan Range, where the impact of climate warming is uncertain. The data, which includes long-term observations of permafrost and active layer temperatures, can provide insights into the changes occurring within the permafrost. This is essential for assessing the stability and sustainability of the ground in the region, which in turn informs regional development and engineering practices. Understanding the thermal state of permafrost and its dynamics helps in designing infrastructure that can withstand or adapt to changing conditions, ensuring safety and longevity.",

Boreholes such as GH4, MG3, MG1, MG2, GH5, and YTLH2 provide data including the mean annual ground temperature at depths of up to 20 meters. The instruments used likely include thermistors or similar temperature sensors for monitoring ground temperatures over extended periods. Additionally, the depth of permafrost is established by drilling to various depths, typically between 1.1 to 7.0 meters, to assess the permafrost table.",
