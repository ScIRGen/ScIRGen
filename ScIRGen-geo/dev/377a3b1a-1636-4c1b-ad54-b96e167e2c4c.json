            "description": "Although the global climate is warming, external forcing driven by explosive volcanic eruptions may still cause abrupt cooling. Herein, we investigated the magnitude of forest resilience shifts and their recovery time to the strong and lasting volcanic cooling after the 1809 and 1815 Tambora eruptions using 3304 tree-ring width chronologies across the globe. Global raw tree-ring width chronologies were collected from 3 sources, the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB), the GenTree dendroecological collectionand the collection from the tree-ring group of the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITPCAS).  We transformed the raw tree-ring width data (RW) into ring-width indices (RWI) by removing long-term trends caused by aging and increasing trunk diameter.  Since the continuous two major eruptions were recorded to have long-term effects on ecosystems, we used the most conservative standardization technique of fitting negative exponential curves to detrend tree-level series using the dplR package in R. Site-level, standard chronologies of RWI were averaged using a bi-weight robust mean. A 30-year cubic smoothing spline was also used to detrend for checking the stability of the influence time of volcanic forcing on tree growth.",

                "The 1809 and 1815 Tambora eruptions caused lasting cold extremes worldwide, providing a unique lens that allows us to investigate the magnitude of global forest resilience to and recovery from volcanic cooling. Large volcanic eruptions are among the few natural phenomena that can force changes in the Earth’s climate system. The injection of sulfate aerosols can lead to a significant decrease in surface insolation and cause abrupt cooling at regional to global scales. This cooling effect also dampens the global hydrological cycle and increases the likelihood of subsequent El Niño events, causing anomalously dry conditions across the monsoon regions. Such extreme climate events severely impact forest resilience, reduce the provision of ecosystem services, and can even lead to societal collapses. The Mt. Tambora eruption in April 1815 was the largest explosive volcanic eruption recorded since AD 1400. The two eruptions together made the 1810s the coldest decade during the past 500 years. Tree-ring width variability is also a direct indicator of ecological responses and resilience to such extreme events."

Growth stability was substantially reduced (42.0%) in the Southwestern US from 1815 to 1822 compared to the pre-eruption 10 years. Growth stability was also significantly reduced in the Russian Arctic, for larch forests in western and central Europe, for conifers along the west coast of the U.S. and in eastern North America, and for deciduous broadleaves (Nothofagus) in the southern Andes. By contrast, for evergreen needleleaf forests in northern Europe, in the Mediterranean region, and in New Zealand, as well as for deciduous broadleaf forests in western and central Europe, the growth stability significantly increased. A significant and continuous decrease in growth resilience occurred either just after the eruption (1809) year or up to 3 years later. The longest influence times (over the year 1824) were found in the Mongolian and Tibetan Plateaus, the west coast of the US, mountainous regions of the Southwestern US, and central North America."

                    "Answer": "Accurate assessment of tree growth resilience to historical volcanic eruptions is enabled by collecting global raw tree-ring width chronologies from diverse sources like the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB), the GenTree dendroecological collection, and the collection from the tree-ring group of the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITPCAS). This data is then transformed into ring-width indices (RWI) by removing long-term trends due to aging and increased trunk diameter.",
