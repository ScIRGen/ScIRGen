Each observation lasted from 9am to 5pm at intervals of 10 minutes, in the maize field and the sunflower field on Jun. 16, and in Wulidun farmland quadrates on Jul. 1, 2008.\n     Located 15cm above the canopy, the quantum light meter was used to measure PARci and PARcr (at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°); located 15cm above the ground, for PARgi and PARgr. And then PAR= (PARci- PARcr)- ( PARgi- PARgr); Fpar =PAR/ PARci.\n     Data were archived as Excel files.",

It is calculated as the ratio of the net photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by the canopy to the incident PAR at the canopy top. This measurement is crucial for assessing the canopy's ability to conduct photosynthesis and is important for developing and validating remote sensing algorithms for FPAR retrieval.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using the 3415 series quantum meters involve placing the sensors above the canopy and on the ground at specific angles to measure incident and reflected radiation, providing detailed PAR and FPAR values. This approach allows for continuous monitoring at 10-minute intervals over a 6-hour period during specific days, offering high temporal resolution and specific angle measurements, which may differ from other techniques that might use different sensors or intervals, potentially affecting the granularity and type of data collected.",

The instruments, placed at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90° angles, capture varying amounts of radiation due to changes in sun position and canopy structure, leading to differences in calculated PAR and FPAR values.",

The sensors also measure the reflected radiation from the canopy (PARcr). Additionally, quantum sensors are placed 15cm above the ground to measure the incident (PARgi) and reflected (PARgr) radiation at the ground level. The data collection is conducted over a six-hour period from 9 AM to 5 PM, with measurements recorded every 10 minutes, and the results are stored in Excel format along with photos of the observation points.",
