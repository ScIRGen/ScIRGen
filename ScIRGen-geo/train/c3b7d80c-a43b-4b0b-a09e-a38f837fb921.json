            "description": "1. Data content: global 0.25-degree resolution daily snow depth product for seasonal snow from 2013 to 2020, including land areas in the northern and southern hemispheres except Antarctica and Greenland.\n2. Data source and processing method: In view of the underestimation problem of current mainstream passive microwave snow products in mountainous areas, the machine learning algorithm is used to generate a new snow depth product, which trained the representative snow depth measurements from meteorological stations globally, year by year, based on both the AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) brightness temperatures and the prior knowledge of snow parameters from snow process model simulations. The snow priors come from the improved multiple-layer SNTHERM (Snow Thermal Model) simulation driven by the GLDAS (Global Land Data Assistance System) dataset, including snow grain size, snow density and the first-guess snow depth parameters. The machine learning algorithm is mainly used to overcome the biases in snow priors caused by the forcing dataset error. The meteorological station measurements participating in the construction of ground truths are from the GHCN (Global Historical Climate Network), GSOD (Global Surface Summary of the Day), USHCN (The United States Historical Climate Network), ECA&D (European Climate Assessment&Dataset) and daily snow depth measurements from reference meteorological stations in China. The snow cover extent is jointly determined based on MODIS 0.05 ° Climate Grid snow cover product and SNTHERM simulations.\n3. Data quality description: 1) Cross validation: The root mean square error (RMSE) of retrieved snow depth validated by 1.72 million samples in eight years worldwide is 12.4 cm. The bias of snow depth is not sensitive to elevation and forest cover fraction. 2) Independent validation: the RMSE validated using the 25 km quadrat, 500 m quadrat and snow course measurements from the China Snow Survey in 2018-2019 years is 4.93-8.9 cm; RMSE validated against the EuroAlps dataset and CanSWE dataset are 17.3 cm and 24.2 cm, respectively, in the 0-100 cm snow depth range; if the snow depth is converted to the snow water equivalent (SWE) using a fixed density of 240 kg/m3, the SWE RMSE validated against the GlobSnow validation dataset - the Russian part and the US SNOTEL dataset are 29.2 mm and 40.1 mm in 0-200 mm range. Due to the differences between the training dataset and the independent validation dataset, it is difficult to have a fully-unbiased validation result in the deep snow range; however, the new product still slightly outperforms the JAXA official AMSR2 product and GlobSnow product in the mountains and at the edge of mountains, respectively. Note: The current validation results are calculated based on the representative in-situ measurements. Please contact the data provider and refer to the paper for representative evaluation criteria.\n4. Data application achievements and prospects: research on the spatial and temporal distributions of seasonal snow cover; on requirement of a seasonal snow information to support the study of other elements in the cryosphere; researchers looking for a less-biased passive microwave snow depth product in the mountains at current stage.\n5. Others: We would like to express our gratitude to the providers of all kinds of raw datasets to generate our new product. Please refer to the paper for the acknowledgement and data description.",

Recent methodologies have addressed this issue by employing machine learning algorithms to integrate brightness temperatures from the AMSR2 sensor with prior knowledge from snow process models. This integration is trained using globally representative meteorological station data, which helps mitigate biases introduced by meteorological influences in the prior knowledge, resulting in more accurate snow depth retrievals.",

This prior knowledge is derived from the GLDAS-driven SNTHERM multi-layer snow physical process model, which includes parameters such as snow grain size, snow density, and initial snow depth. Global meteorological station data, which have undergone representativeness testing, are used as training samples to generate annual global snow depth retrieval datasets from 2013 to 2020.
