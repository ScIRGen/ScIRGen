            "description": "The table contains 40Ar / 39Ar dating information of mylonite samples from the Korean Peninsula. At first, the samples were separated by crushing → water bleaching → sieving → magnetic separation → specific gravity liquid separation, and then the single mineral dating samples such as biotite, amphibole and Muscovite were selected by hand under binocular lens. The experimental method is 40Ar / 39Ar dating. After pretreatment, the samples were irradiated in the \"swimming pool reactor\" of the Chinese Academy of atomic energy. The helix MC of the Institute of geology of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences was used to heat the samples in stages. The isoplot program was used to calculate the plateau age and the positive and negative isochrons. This data can provide data support for understanding the eastward extension of the Dabie Sulu orogenic belt on the Korean Peninsula.",

                    "Answer": "The 40Ar/39Ar dating method involves analyzing mylonite samples to determine their age through a series of steps that include crushing, floating, sieving, magnetic separation, and heavy liquid separation to isolate minerals like biotite, amphibole, and muscovite for dating. The samples are then irradiated, with irradiation conducted at the 'swimming pool reactor' of the China Institute of Atomic Energy. The analysis uses a gas multi-collector rare gas mass spectrometer Helix MC for stepwise heating, followed by age calculation using the ISOPLOT program to provide reliable data on the extension of the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt into the Korean Peninsula.",

                    "Answer": "The use of multiple mineral separation techniques, such as water flotation, sieving, magnetic separation, and heavy liquid separation, followed by careful manual selection under a binocular microscope, can enhance the purity and specificity of mineral samples like biotite, amphibole, and muscovite. When these meticulously prepared samples undergo 40Ar/39Ar dating using advanced mass spectrometry, such as the Helix MC gas multi-collector rare gas mass spectrometer, the precision and reliability of the age dating results are likely to improve significantly. These rigorous methods ensure that the samples are representative and uncontaminated, leading to more accurate and reproducible age determinations. Consequently, this can provide robust data support for understanding geological processes, such as the extension of the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt into the Korean Peninsula.",

After preparation, samples are irradiated at the 'swimming pool reactor' of the China Institute of Atomic Energy.
