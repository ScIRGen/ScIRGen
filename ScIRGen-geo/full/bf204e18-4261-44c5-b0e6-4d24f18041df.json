            "description": "Muli coal mine is a typical industrial and mining area in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Taking Muli coal mine as an example, in the area delimitation, we take the coordinate boundaries of East, West, North and south to cut it out, and get a rectangular area, and take it as the mining area of Muli coal mine. We use the national 1km land use remote sensing monitoring data provided by the resource, environment and data center of the Institute of geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data production of the three phases in 2000, 2005 and 2010 is based on Landsat TM / ETM Remote Sensing Image of each phase as the main data source, and the two phases in 2015 and 2020 are based on Landsat 8 oli / tirs remote sensing image as the main data source, which are generated by manual visual interpretation. The data format is grid TIF, and the resolution is 1km.",
            "instructions": "The data is a folder data, which contains 5 raster images.\nThe naming format is: year.\nFor example, 2000. TIF represents the grid image of land use of Muli coal mine in 2000.\nIt can be opened with ArcGIS or envi, and the DN value of the pixel indicates different feature coverage.

                    "Answer": "The use of Landsat TM/ETM and Landsat8 OLI/TIRS remote sensing imagery is significant because they serve as the primary data sources for producing land cover data. These satellite images enable researchers to monitor and visually interpret land use changes over time, specifically for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, in a typical mining area like Muli coal mine. The imagery provides a resolution of 1km, allowing for detailed analysis and monitoring of land cover changes over a 20-year period, crucial for understanding environmental impacts in the region.",

The periods 2000, 2005, and 2010 relied on Landsat TM/ETM imagery, while 2015 and 2020 utilized Landsat8 OLI/TIRS imagery. These choices were likely driven by the resolution, spectral bands, and availability of these satellite platforms, which are well-suited for detecting changes in land cover and use over time. Additionally, the manual visual interpretation method was chosen to ensure accuracy in identifying and classifying land cover types in the complex terrain of mining areas like the Muli Coal Mine.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using Landsat TM/ETM and Landsat8 OLI/TIRS remote sensing imagery as the primary data sources for different time periods (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020). The region is defined by coordinates forming a rectangular area to delineate the mining zone. Data preprocessing includes visual interpretation to classify land use, ensuring consistency across different time periods.
