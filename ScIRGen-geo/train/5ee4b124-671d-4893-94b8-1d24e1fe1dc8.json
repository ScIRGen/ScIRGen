            "description": "This framework aims to improve the predicting power of species distribution models through testing models using demographic history since Last Glacial Maximum. By building species distribution models based on different combinations of environmental variables, and then comparing with current distributions, different scenarios of demographic histories can be generated. These scenarios will be compared with demographic history which reconstructed using genetic data. In this way, the best environmental variables combination can be determined. Then, building species distribution model using the chosen environmental variables combination will have more predicting power in predicting distribution changes in the future.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods that use genetic data focus on reconstructing the evolutionary history of species populations by analyzing genetic markers, which provides insights into the historical dynamics and adaptation processes of species. In contrast, methods relying on species distribution models emphasize assessing the influence of environmental factors on species distribution by predicting historical and future distribution areas. The former approach provides a genetic perspective, while the latter focuses on environmental and ecological factors, and both methods can be compared for their effectiveness in determining the most predictive environmental factor combinations for species distribution changes under climate change scenarios.",

This can result in a more accurate evaluation of changes in future species distribution areas, as it helps identify which environmental factor combinations have the best predictive capability by comparing assumed population dynamics models with genetic data-derived evolutionary histories.",

This is achieved by comparing predicted species distribution during the last glacial period with current distribution, reconstructing evolutionary histories using genetic data, and identifying the best combination of environmental factors for prediction under future climate change scenarios.",

These predictions are compared with current distribution ranges to develop hypothetical population dynamics models. Genetic data is then used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of species populations and compared with the hypothetical histories to determine the most effective combination of environmental factors for prediction. Finally, this optimal combination is used to forecast potential changes in species distribution under future climate change scenarios, enabling the evaluation and enhancement of the predictive capability of species distribution models.",
