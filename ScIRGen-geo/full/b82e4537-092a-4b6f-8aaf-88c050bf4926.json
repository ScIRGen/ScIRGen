            "description": "This dataset includes Coal geochemical elements, soil XRF data, identification of charcoal remains data and 14C dating data from Jirentaigoukou site in Xinjiang. Coal has long fuelled human civilizations. The history of systematic coal fuel exploitation has been traced back to the late third millennium before present (post-2500 BP). Although sporadic combustion of coal for fuel were reported in some prehistoric archaeological sites, evidence for the systematic exploitation of coal for fuel before 2500 BP remains lacking. Here, we report comprehensive understanding for the earliest systematic exploitation of coal for fuel at the Jirentaigoukou site in Xinjiang, NW China, at ~3600 BP. The main body of the site witnessed systematic exploitation of bituminous coals, illustrating a complete chaîne opératoire with selective mining, planned storage and extensive combustion. Our results transform the knowledge of energy history by extending the upper limit of the systematic exploitation of coal for fuel by approximately a millennium, and provide a precedent of energy transition under intense conflict between social demand and environmental deterioration.",
