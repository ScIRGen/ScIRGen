The first soil survey was conducted in 2012. After the representativeness evaluation of collected samples, we conducted an additional sampling in 2013.\nThese samples are representative enough to represent the soil variation in the Heihe River Basin, of which the soil variation in each landscape could be accounted for. The sampling depths in field refer to the sampling specification of Chinese Soil Taxonomy, in which soil samples were taken from genetic soil horizons.",

                    "Answer": "The representative sampling method for collecting soil samples in the Heihe River Basin is designed to cover upstream, midstream, and downstream areas, encompassing typical landscape types to reflect overall spatial distribution patterns of soil properties. The sampling depth is guided by Chinese soil classification standards, focusing on diagnostic horizons and properties. This approach aims to ensure comprehensive representation across different landscape regions, potentially offering a more holistic view compared to methods that may focus on specific layers or areas.",

Representative sampling techniques should be employed, and the collection depth should be based on diagnostic layers and characteristics according to a standardized soil classification system, such as China's soil system classification.",

The sampling method employed is representative sampling, which considers the upstream, midstream, and downstream areas of the basin to ensure comprehensive coverage. Additionally, soil samples are collected based on diagnostic layers and characteristics following the Chinese Soil Taxonomy to ensure consistency and reliability.",

This involves representative sampling across the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Heihe River Basin, ensuring coverage of typical landscape types to reflect the overall spatial distribution patterns of soil properties in the region. Soil samples are collected from diagnostic horizons and characteristics based on the Chinese Soil Taxonomy.",
