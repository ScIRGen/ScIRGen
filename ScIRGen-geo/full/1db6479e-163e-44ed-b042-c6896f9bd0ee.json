            "description": "This data set is daily surface albedo product over Tibet plateau region from 2002 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0.00425°. The MODIS reflectance data product was used to retrieve the Extended Multi-Sensor Combined BRDF Inversion (EMCBI) Model which has coupled with topographic effects with assistance of a BRDF priori-knowledge. The daily BRDF was retrieved in a 5-day period to collect multi-angular information from MODIS observations. And then the daily albedo is estimated, where the black sky albedo was calculated at local noon. MODIS surface reflectance data (MOD09GA and MYD09GA) are downloaded from the official website. The albedo product is quality-controlled with better temporal and spatial continuity in Tibet plateau area. The validation results show that it meets the accuracy requirements of albedo application with higher precisions comparing to the other similar products. And thus, this product is useful for the long-term environmental monitoring and radiation energy budget research study.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of surface albedo data collection, '耦合地形因子的多源遥感数据协同反演的BRDF/反照率模型' refers to a model that combines terrain factors with multi-source remote sensing data to collaboratively invert the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo. This approach integrates prior knowledge for quality control, enabling the inversion of high-precision, temporally and spatially continuous daily resolution BRDF/albedo data.",

These challenges require sophisticated modeling techniques to ensure accurate and spatially continuous daily albedo estimates, which are crucial for supporting studies on radiation balance and environmental changes in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures involve utilizing MODIS reflectance data (MOD09GA, MYD09GA) and applying a BRDF/albedo model that incorporates coupled terrain factors and multi-source remote sensing data. The model uses a synergistic inversion approach and integrates prior knowledge to ensure quality control. A daily resolution BRDF is synthesized over a five-day period, allowing for the estimation of daily albedo. The model ensures spatial and temporal continuity and has undergone validation to meet albedo application accuracy requirements, particularly in mountainous areas.",
