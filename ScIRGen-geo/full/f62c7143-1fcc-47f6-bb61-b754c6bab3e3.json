            "description": "This dataset contains the automatic weather station (AWS) measurements from site No.11 in the flux observation matrix from 2 June to 18 September, 2012. The site (100.34197° E, 38.86991° N) was located in a cropland (maize surface) in Yingke irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1575.65 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity (HMP45AC; 5 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), wind speed and direction (03001; 10 m, towards north), a four-component radiometer (CNR1; 6 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, vertically downward), soil temperature profile (109; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), and soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates with one below the vegetation and the other between plants, 0.06 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), air pressure (press, hpa), precipitation (rain, mm), wind speed (Ws_10 m, m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m, °), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation; W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IR_2, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, below the vegetation; Gs_2 and Gs_3, W/m^2), soil temperature profile (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_60 cm, and Ts_100 cm, ℃), and soil moisture profile (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_60 cm, and Ms_100 cm, %).\n           The data processing and quality control steps were as follows. (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min; therefore, there were 144 records per day. The missing data were filled with -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) In this dataset, the time of 0:10 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:10; the data were stored in *.xlsx format. (5) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2016) (for multi-scale observation experiment or sites information), Xu et al. (2013) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

These matrices are used to capture data on variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, precipitation, wind speed and direction, radiation components, surface radiation temperature, soil heat flux, soil moisture, and soil temperature. The data collected from these matrices help in understanding the interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere, particularly in heterogeneous landscapes like agricultural areas.",

                    "Question": "How do the data collection methods for surface evapotranspiration measurements over heterogeneous surfaces compare to those used for homogeneous surfaces in terms of instrumentation and data processing?",
                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for surface evapotranspiration measurements over heterogeneous surfaces involve a variety of instruments, such as automatic weather stations equipped with sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction, as well as radiation and soil temperature sensors at multiple depths. Data processing includes ensuring the consistency of data with a set number of data points per day, handling missing data with specific markers, and removing redundant or out-of-range data. These methods account for the complexity of heterogeneous surfaces by employing multiple sensor types and careful data management to capture variability in environmental conditions.",
