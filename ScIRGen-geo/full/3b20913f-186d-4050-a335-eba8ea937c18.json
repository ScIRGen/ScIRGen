            "description": "On the basis of previous studies, the petrographic analysis of Panlong Pb Zn deposit was carried out under the electron microscope. Meanwhile, the energy spectrum analysis of scanning electron microscope showed that radial barite was purer than veinlet barite and did not contain Sr isotope. It is considered that radial barite and veinlet barite are products of different stages, and radial barite was formed in the primary sedimentary stage, The veinlet barite was formed in the activation transformation period. Secondly, a series of homogenization temperature and freezing point temperature of fluid inclusions in barite were measured by using hot and cold table analysis of fluid inclusions in barite during primary deposition and activation transformation. Through the analysis of these temperatures, it is found that the average homogenization temperature of barite during primary deposition is 147.2 °， The mean freezing point temperature is - 4.7 °， The average salinity calculated from freezing point temperature is 7.09% NaCl EQV; The average homogenization temperature during the activation period is 138.9 °， The mean freezing point temperature is -7.75 °， The average salinity calculated by freezing point temperature is 10.90% nacleqv. Through comparison with previous studies, it is found that the fluid characteristics of Panlong Pb Zn deposit in primary sedimentary period are very similar to those of SEDEX deposit, and the ore-forming fluid is mainly evaporated seawater; The barite formed during the activation transformation period may be the result of the intrusion of epithermal solution into the transformed ore body or the influence of another late hydrothermal exhalation event after the primary sedimentary mineralization.",

                    "Answer": "Fluid inclusions are small pockets of fluid trapped within minerals during their formation. In the context of the Panlong lead-zinc deposit, fluid inclusions within barite are analyzed using a heating and cooling stage to measure their homogenization temperatures and freezing point temperatures. These measurements help infer the conditions during different mineral formation periods, such as the primary sedimentary stage and the reformation stage, by providing average temperature and salinity data that indicate the nature of the mineralizing fluids.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in fluid inclusion temperatures and salinity levels suggest that the barite formed during two distinct geological periods, each associated with different fluid characteristics. The primary sedimentary period barite shows a higher average homogenization temperature and lower salinity, resembling evaporated seawater, which aligns with SEDEX-type mineral deposit fluids. In contrast, the barite from the later activated transformation period has a lower homogenization temperature and higher salinity, indicating possible modification by low-temperature hydrothermal fluids or late-stage hydrothermal venting events.",

                    "Answer": "The purity and isotopic composition differences between radiating and vein-like barite are influenced by their formation periods. Radiating barite, found to be purer and lacking Sr isotopes, is associated with the primary sedimentary period, whereas vein-like barite forms during an active modification period. These differences suggest distinct formation processes, with radiating barite forming in the primary sedimentary stage and vein-like barite forming during subsequent hydrothermal events.",

                    "Answer": "Analyzing the homogenization and freezing temperatures of fluid inclusions within barite can lead to insights into their formation periods. For example, it was found that the primary sedimentation period barite had an average homogenization temperature of 147.2° and a freezing temperature of -4.7°, which suggested a salinity of 7.09% NaCleqv, similar to SEDEX-type deposits, indicating evaporated seawater as the mineralizing fluid. In contrast, the barite from the reactivation period showed a homogenization temperature of 138.9° and a freezing temperature of -7.75°, with a calculated salinity of 10.90% NaCleqv, suggesting that this barite formed due to a later hydrothermal event, possibly involving low-temperature hydrothermal fluids or another thermal event affecting pre-existing mineral deposits.",
