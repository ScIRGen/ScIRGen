            "description": "The dataset of mobile meteorological station observations was obtained in the foci experiment area from March to April, 2008. To synergize the very high resolution airborne remote sensing and ground-based measurements, 11 mobile observations, including meteorological stations (for meteorological data) and GPS (for observation sites), were carried out in Binggou, A'rou and Biandukou. The items included the wind speed and direction at 3.03m (the truck height 1.84m plus the vane height 1.19m), the air temperature and humidity at 3.04m (the truck height 1.84m plus the vane height 1.2m), the surface temperature (the truck height 1.84m plus 1.06m) and the total radiation (the truck height 1.84m plus 1.39m).\n     The observation sites and time were as follows:\n     Dadongshu mountain pass-A'rou\t\t15-3-2008\n     Biandukou-Qilian\t\t\t\t18-3-2008\n     A'rou-Biandukou\t\t\t\t19-3-2008\n     Qilian-Minle\t\t\t20-3-2008\n     Mingle-Zhangye\t\t\t21-3-2008\n     Binggou-Dadongshu mountain pass\t22-3-2008\n     Binggou-Dadongshu mountain pass\t24-3-2008\n     Binggou-Dadongshu mountain pass\t29-3-2008\n     Binggou-Dadongshu mountain pass\t30-3-2008\n     Qilian-A'rou\t\t\t31-3-2008\n     A'rou\t\t\t\t01-4-2008\n     The data were named after WATER_Mobile_ AWS_yyyymmdd (yyyymmdd for observation time).",

The GPS system records location information, while the meteorological observation system records meteorological data, such as wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, humidity, surface temperature, and total radiation.

These stations are equipped with a meteorological observation system and a GPS system that separately record meteorological data and positional information, respectively. In contrast, fixed meteorological stations typically collect data from a single location, potentially offering more consistent temporal data but lacking the spatial variability that mobile stations provide.",

These observations aim to collect detailed meteorological data such as wind speed and direction, air temperature and humidity, surface temperature, and total radiation, which are crucial for understanding and modeling the cold region hydrological processes.",
