            "description": "Zircon U-Pb dating data of biotite K-feldspar granite, host rock of tongtongling molybdenum deposit, Hainan Island, 2016-2017, were tested by the State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The selected zircon target was used for LA-ICP-MS data collection, with helium as carrier gas and laser spot diameter of 31 μ m. The pulse frequency is 8 Hz, and the analysis time of each point is 60 s, including 20 s background test and 40 s sample signal. The elements tested include u, th, Pb and their isotopic ratios. Icpmsdata cal 8.6 software was used for zircon U-Pb dating and trace element data processing, and isoplot V3.0 software was used for concordance mapping. This data can provide data support for future geochemical model analysis of gaotongling molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island.\nThe above data are published in the core journal of deposit geology, the data are true and reliable, and the data are stored in the form of Excel.",
            "instructions": "The data were stored in Excel format. The sample name \"GTL\" represents the gaotongling deposit. In the excel header, \"gtl3-xx\" represents the measuring point, in which \"gtl3\" represents the sample code sample 3 and \"XX\" represents the zircon measuring point number.",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS stands for Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. It is a technique used in geochemical analysis to collect data on the composition of minerals, such as zircon, by ablating the sample with a laser and then analyzing the resulting plasma with a mass spectrometer. This method allows for detailed measurement of elements and isotopes, such as U, Th, and Pb, providing critical data for processes like U-Pb dating and analysis of trace elements in geological samples.",

If helium is not utilized, there could be a decrease in the detection sensitivity and an increase in the likelihood of inaccurate U, Th, and Pb isotopic readings, potentially impacting the precision and reliability of zircon U-Pb dating results.",
