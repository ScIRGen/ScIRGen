            "description": "Based on the analysis of brgdgts and hydrogen isotopes of leaf wax in lake sediments from Tengchong Qinghai (tcqh) in Yunnan Province, this study shows for the first time the high-resolution annual average temperature change history of low latitude land since the last glacial period (since the last 88000 years). According to the annual average temperature of South Asia established by tcqh core, there are two warm periods of 88000-71000 years and 45000-22000 years in this region, and the temperature range is about 2-3 ° C. Since the Holocene, the temperature has been increasing for about 1-2 years ° C。",

                    "Answer": "In the context of reconstructing past temperatures over the last 88,000 years, '支链甘油二烷基甘油四醚酯（brGDGTs）' refers to branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, which are biomarkers found in lake sediments. These compounds are used to infer past temperature changes because their distribution and abundance in sediments can be correlated with historical temperature variations. The analysis of brGDGTs allows researchers to reconstruct high-resolution annual mean temperature histories in low-latitude terrestrial regions, as demonstrated through the study of lake sediment cores.",

These changes indicate significant climate shifts comparable to glacial-interglacial periods, and a continuous warming trend of about 1-2°C since the Holocene.",

This integration might reveal more accurate reconstructions of temperature fluctuations, help identify correlations with global climate events, and improve predictions of future climate trends by providing a more holistic view of historical climate dynamics in regions like the low-latitude areas over the past 88,000 years.",
