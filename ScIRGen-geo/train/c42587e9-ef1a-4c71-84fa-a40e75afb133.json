            "description": "Land cover dataset of MODIS is a product that describes the types of land cover based on the data obtained from Terra and Aqua observations for one year. The land cover dataset contains 17 major land cover types, including 11 natural vegetation types, 3 land development and mosaic types and 3 non-vegetation land types according to the International Geosphere Biosphere Project (IGBP). MCD12Q1 adopts five different land cover classification schemes. The main technology of information extraction is supervised decision tree classification. Based on MCD12Q1 data from 2001 to 2016, MatLab was used to tailor the masks of 18 key nodes in Southeast Asia and middle East. Finally, the annual land cover dataset of 18 key nodes in Southeast Asia from 2001 to 2016 was obtained.",

                "Information related to land cover is immensely important to global change science. In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Global land cover maps provide thematic characterizations of the Earth's surface that capture biotic and abiotic properties and that are closely tied to the ecological condition of land areas. Because surface properties affect biosphere–atmosphere interaction, accurate land cover information is required to parameterize land surface processes in regional-to-global scale Earth system models. Further, humans depend heavily on goods and services provided by terrestrial ecosystems, and the global area of land dominated by humans has expanded rapidly in the last 100 years. As a consequence, land use and land cover modification by humans are among the most important agents of environmental change at local to global scales and have significant implications for ecosystem health, water quality, and sustainable land management. Until about fifteen years ago, global land cover datasets were based on pre-existing maps and atlases compiled from ground surveys, national mapping programs, and highly generalized biogeographic maps. In the 1990's, global datasets derived from the AVHRR made it possible to map large scale land cover for the first time based on land surface properties observed from remote sensing. As newer moderate resolution remote sensing data sources have emerged (e.g., MODIS, SPOT VEGETATION, MERIS), substantial effort has been focused on developing improved characterizations of global land cover."
