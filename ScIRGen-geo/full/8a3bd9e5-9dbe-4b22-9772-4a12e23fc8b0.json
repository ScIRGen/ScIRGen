Data was derived from Le Quéré et al. (2019). The range of source data is global, and the Qinghai Tibet plateau region is selected in this data set. Original data is interpolated into 0.5*0.5 degree by the nearest neighbor method in space, and the original monthly scale is maintained in time. The data set is the standard model output data, which is often used to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of gross primary productivity, and compared with other remote sensing observations, flux observations and other data.",

These challenges may affect the precision of net primary productivity estimates in heterogeneous landscapes like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

This method adapts the global dataset for regional analysis while maintaining the original monthly temporal scale. The advantage is that it provides detailed regional insights, but it may introduce interpolation errors or loss of fine-scale variability.",
