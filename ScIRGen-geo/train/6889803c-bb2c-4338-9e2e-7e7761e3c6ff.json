Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
