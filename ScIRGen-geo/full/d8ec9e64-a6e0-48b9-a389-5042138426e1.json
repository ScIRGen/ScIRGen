            "description": "The dataset of eddy covariance observations was obtained at the Yingke Oasis station from 27 Dec. 2007 to 31 Dec. 2009. The observation site is located in an irrigation farmland in Yingke (E100°24′37.2″/N38°51′25.7″, 1519.1m), Zhangye city, Gansu province. The experimental area, situated in the middle stream Heihe river basin and with windbreaks space of 500m from east to west and 300m from south to north, is an ideal choice for its flat and open terrain. \n     The original observation items included the latitudinal wind speed Ux (m/s), the latitudinal wind speed Uy (m/s), the longitudinal wind speed Uz (m/s), the ultrasonic temperature Ts (°C), co2 consistency (mg/m^3), h2o consistency (g/m^3), air pressure (KPa) and the abnormal ultrasonic signal (diag_csat). The instrument mount was 2.81m, the ultrasound direction was at an azimuth angle of 0°, the distance between Li7500 and CSAT3 was 30cm and the sampling frequency was 10HZ/s.\n     The dataset was distributed at three levels: Level0 were the raw data acquired by instruments; Level1, including the sensible heat flux (Hs), the latent heat flux (LE_wpl), and co2 flux (Fc_wpl), were real-time eddy covariance output data and stored in .csv month by month; Level2 were processed data in a 30-minute cycle after outliers elimination, coordinates rotation, frequency response correction, WPL correction and initial quality control. The data files were named as follows: station name +data level+data acquisition date. As for detailed information, please refer to Meteorological and Hydrological Flux Data Guide and Eddy Covariance Observation Manual.",

Studies (Dickinson, 1984; Avissar, 1998) on climate models and general circulation models (GCMs) have found that the climate is sensitive to the change of land surface evapotranspiration. At present, remote sensing may be the only efficient technical way that can be used to monitor surface evapotranspiration on the regional scale (Mu et al., 2007; Stisen et al., 2008). Generally, surface evapotranspiration (i.e. latent heat flux LE) is estimated as the residual term of surface energy balance equation. The turbulent heat fluxes models to estimate the sensible heat flux can be categorized into two groups, single-source models and dual-source models, according to whether or not the model separates the foliage and the substrate soil. Many authors (Blyth et al., 1995; Verhoef et al., 1997; Troufleau et al., 1997; Kustas et al., 1999; Massman, 1999) have examined the features of the kB −1 parameter. This problem can be circumvented to some extent by using the dual-source models. In this type of models, the heat fluxes of the components (foliage and soil) are simulated individually, and the aerodynamic temperature is analytically expressed in terms of the component temperatures and a set of resistances, as described in the two-layer model proposed by Shuttleworth and Wallace (1985) and revised by Shuttleworth and Gurney (1990)."

The seasonal difference of GPP and ecosystem respiration (Re) determines the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between the atmosphere and forest ecosystems and is important for understanding global carbon cycle climate change research. The eddy covariance (EC) technique is one of the best micrometeorological methods for the estimation of CO2, water, and energy exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing provides consistent and systematic land surface observations and has played an increasing role in characterizing vegetation structure and estimating GPP. The fundamental methodology of GPP estimation is based on Monteith’s equation: GPP ¼ LUE /C2 fAPAR /C2 PAR, where LUE is the light use efficiency, often in units of mol CO2 per mol photosynthetic photon flux density (mol CO2 mol−1 PPFD), and fAPAR represents the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

The mechanism of radar backscattering from soils is complicated and strongly influenced by surface roughness. Surface soil moisture (mv) is important in agronomic, hydrological, and meteorological processes at all spatial scales. It plays a key role in water stress detection and irrigation management, especially for arid and semi-arid regions. It is well known that space-borne microwave radiometers and scatterometers possess the advantage of high revisit capacity but deficient in coarse spatial resolution. On the contrary, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have the capability to provide finer spatial resolution, on the order of tens of meters, meeting most spatial requirements for watershed management and hydrological applications. Radar systems emit pulses and receive echoes backscattered from the illuminated areas. The intensity value of each pixel is proportional to the radar backscattering coefficient (σ0), which depends on several factors, including the instrument’s technical specifications (frequency and polarization), terrain, dielectric characteristics (εr; strongly related to the soil water content) and the geometrical structure (roughness) of the target surface. The IEM unites the KA and the SPM and was verified by laboratory measurements of bistatic scattering from surfaces with small, intermediate and large scale roughness.
