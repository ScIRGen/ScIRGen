                "Lakes are sensitive to climate change and to anthropogenic factors such as land use; they therefore act as indicators of various contributors of environmental change. Climate-driven fluctuations in lake surface area have been observed in many remote sites in the world. Climate warming has contributed to drying of the Arctic ponds, and the disappearance of lakes in discontinuous permafrost regions in Alaska and Siberia. In the Italian Alps, there have been pond surface area reductions due to increased evaporation/precipitation ratio. The greatest changes in climate have occurred in recent decades in China, and the complexity of interactions between climate and human land use patterns is increasingly being recognized. Although two lake inventories of China were conducted during 1960–1980, and again during 2005–2006, current lake changes and their drivers are still unknown."

We then used this dataset to evaluate the relative contributions from climate change and direct human activities to the long-term trends."

There definitely is a need to update the Chinese lake inventory for datasets with finer spatial resolutions, increase its temporal sampling, and lengthen the data record to multiple decades."

Our analysis exploited the Landsat archive (Level 1 Terrain-corrected product) between 1972 and 2015. At least 516 scenes in each period are needed to cover the whole of China. A total of 3831 scenes (>2TB) from 1972 to 2015 were used.
