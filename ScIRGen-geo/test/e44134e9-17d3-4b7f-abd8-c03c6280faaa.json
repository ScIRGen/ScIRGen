It includes vegetation, cultivated land, artificial surface, water body and others. Based on globeland30, mcd12q1 and globcover2009, the consistent regions were identified and retained. The inconsistent regions were reclassified by deep learning method, and the final classification results were obtained by fusing the above regions.\nThe data has been verified by visual interpretation.\nThe data are applied to the study of construction land dynamics and anthropogenic influence in Pan-Third Pole cities.\nData type: grid.\nProjection mode: UTM projection.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of urban land cover data analysis, 'land cover classification' refers to the categorization of the earth's surface into different classes such as vegetation, cropland, artificial surfaces, water bodies, and others. This classification is achieved by identifying consistent areas using datasets like GlobeLand30, MCD12Q1, and Globcover2009, and then using deep learning methods to reclassify areas where classifications were inconsistent. The process ensures the integration of these classifications to produce a final result, which is verified by manual visual interpretation.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using deep learning for classifying inconsistent areas involves using algorithms to automatically reclassify regions where original classifications from datasets like GlobeLand30, MCD12Q1, and Globcover2009 do not match. This approach is likely more efficient than traditional visual interpretation, which requires manual assessment and correction of data. However, the accuracy of deep learning methods depends on the algorithm's training and validation, whereas visual interpretation relies on expert knowledge for accuracy. Each method has its own strengths, with deep learning potentially offering faster processing times and visual interpretation providing highly accurate corrections through human expertise.",

For areas with classification discrepancies, deep learning methods are applied to reclassify them. The final classification results are obtained by merging the consistently classified regions with the reclassified areas. Each year's data undergoes manual visual interpretation verification to ensure accuracy.",
