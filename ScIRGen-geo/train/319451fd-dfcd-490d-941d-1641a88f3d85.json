            "description": "The data set covers 599 meteorological stations in five Central Asian countries, including the following elements: * daily maximum temperature, * daily minimum temperature, * observed temperature, * Precipitation (i.e. rain, melting snow), covering the following dates: 1980-1986; 1996-2005; 2010; 2014; 2015\nThe data comes from ghcn-d, a data set containing global land area daily observation data, which integrates climate records.\nThe data is a direct measurement of surface temperature, without interpolation or model assumptions, and contains many long-term site records. The disadvantage is uneven space coverage. Due to changes in observation time, site location, and the type of thermometer used, the records contain many heterogeneity.\nFor more information about this dataset, see https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcnd-data-access",

However, monthly means and averages are not sufficient for all climate applications. For example, the analysis of changes in the length of the growing season (Kunkel et al. 2004), changes in the frequency of heavy precipitation (Min et al. 2011), and changes in heat wave frequency and duration (Della Marta et al. 2007) all require data at least at the daily resolution. Unfortunately, daily data are comparatively less accessible than monthly values, in part because of impediments (e.g., mandates for cost recovery) in many countries for releasing daily climate data for widespread public use (Alexander et al. 2006).

A semiautomatic method for identifying large jumps and other erratic behavior in time series of annual totals was also applied. Gross shifts in precipitation time series were identified by means of the standard normal homogeneity test (Alexandersson 1986) applied to station time series of annual precipitation totals computed from the daily data. A manual examination of station records where maximum and minimum temperatures failed the outlier and/or inconsistency checks at least 300 times revealed two problems. In the last record integrity check, U.S. temperature records for which the time of observation has been documented are tested for inconsistencies between the reported observation time and the reported temperatures."

In the past, limitations in data availability and computational resources have frequently restricted such studies to particular countries, regions, or individual locations. Thanks to technological advances as well as a greater willingness of countries to share their daily observations, it has become possible to assemble and regularly update a global dataset of historical daily meteorological observations. GHCN-Daily consists of more than 1,500,000,000 observations at over 40,000 land-based stations, some of which date back to the mid-1800s. With this diversity of data comes a large variety of measurement, recording, digitization, transmission, and processing problems.

                "Although effective, the semiautomatic approach is impractical for datasets as large as GHCN-Daily, which must be reprocessed regularly to incorporate additional historical and real-time data. Therefore, the challenge is to design a QA system that, without manual intervention, is effective at detecting a variety of data errors and that has a low false-positive rate, or fraction of flagged values that are false positives. Unfortunately, the electronic data files do not include an indication of whether the reported value is due to snow, hail, or another form of frozen precipitation, often making it virtually impossible for either data users or QA procedures to distinguish reports of hail from the at least equally frequent, erroneous, warm-season nonzero values in the SNOW and SNWD fields."

            "methods": [
                "Manual review of random samples of the values flagged as errors is used to set the threshold for each procedure such that its false-positive rate, or fraction of valid values identified as errors, is minimized. In addition, the tests are arranged in a deliberate sequence in which the performance of the later checks is enhanced by the error detection capabilities of the earlier tests. The QA of daily surface observations is frequently performed in a semiautomatic fashion in which trained validators examine a subset of values flagged by the automatic procedures and override the system’s decision whenever they deem a flagged value to be valid. The GHCN-Daily QA system consists of procedures that test for all of the above-mentioned types of data errors. Many of these are replicates or extensions of checks employed by others, while others, such as the frequent-value and megaconsistency checks, utilize concepts that have received little or no attention in the peer-reviewed literature. Each individual check in the GHCN-Daily QA system is required to have a false-positive rate of no more than 20%. To ensure adherence to this requirement, each test is applied in a preliminary fashion to the entire GHCN-Daily dataset. Random samples of flagged values are then manually inspected for a range of plausible test thresholds, and the fraction of false positives in each sample is determined. The tests in the GHCN-Daily system can be grouped into five general categories that are executed in the following order: basic integrity checks, outlier tests, internal and temporal consistency checks, spatial consistency checks, and “megaconsistency” checks."
