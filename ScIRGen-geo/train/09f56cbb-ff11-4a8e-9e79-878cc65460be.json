            "description": "Numerical test: The climate model used is the regional climate model RegCM4.1. RegCM4.1 developed by the Italian Research Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). In the test of regional model simulation, the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric model is 50 km and the vertical direction is 18 layers; Online coupling sand dust module. Sea surface temperature The sea surface temperature interpolated by OISST is used. The test includes two groups: the Middle Paleocene topographic test (MP,~60Ma BP, test name 60ma_regcm4.1_xxx. nc) and the Late Oligocene (LO,~25Ma BP, test name 25ma_regcM4.1_xxx. nc) The MP regional terrain modification test removed the northern part of the plateau and approximately replaced the terrain distribution of Asian land during the 60Ma period. BP regional terrain modification test only removed the terrain of Pamirs Plateau, approximately replacing the terrain distribution of Asian land during the 25Ma period. The sand and dust source areas of the two tests have not changed, and the sand and dust circulation process has been opened online.\nOutput time: All tests were integrated for 22 years, using the average results of the last 20 years of each test.\nThe data can be used to explain the difference of drought evolution in different regions around the plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The climate feedback simulation output from using a regional climate model like RegCM4.1, as described, involves a horizontal resolution of 50 km and 18 vertical layers, which provides a detailed regional focus. This contrasts with global climate models that often have coarser resolutions but can cover larger areas globally. The regional model allows for more detailed topographical modifications, such as removing specific highland terrain to approximate historical land distributions, which may provide more nuanced insights into regional climate dynamics and feedback mechanisms for specific periods such as the Middle and Late Eocene (~60Ma and ~25Ma).",

                    "Answer": "The atmospheric circulation data collected using the RegCM4.1 model suggests that varying geographical configurations, such as removing the northern plateau in the 60Ma configuration and removing the Pamir Plateau in the 25Ma configuration, can significantly alter climate feedback mechanisms. These changes can help explain the differences in drought evolution around the plateau regions during these periods, reflecting how topographical modifications influence regional climate dynamics over geological timescales.",

                    "Answer": "Using different geophysical configurations from 60Ma and 25Ma, specifically altering the topography to reflect the land distribution of Asia during these periods, results in varied atmospheric circulation patterns. The experiments simulate how these configurations affect climate feedback, particularly focusing on differences in arid region evolution around the plateau. The use of a regional climate model with a horizontal resolution of 50km and 18 vertical layers allows for detailed insights into these climatic variations, with additional factors like dust module coupling considered in the simulations.",

The simulations aim to provide insights into the evolution of arid regions around plateaus during these periods by examining the climate dynamics with altered topographies that reflect conditions approximately 60 million and 25 million years ago.",

Sea surface temperatures are derived using OISST interpolation. The simulations involve modifying regional topography to reflect conditions from 60 million years ago and 25 million years ago by removing certain highland areas to approximate the land distribution of Asia during those periods. Each simulation is integrated over 22 years, and the average results from the last 20 years are used for analysis.",
