This dataset calculated from GMTED2010 (Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010) which product by USGS (United States Geological Survey). First, the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) of Green Silk Road are obtained by the preprocessing including projection, clipping for the GMTED2010. Second, the slopes are calculated by using the degree method in ArcGIS software to generate the slope dataset of the green Silk Road. This dataset is of good quality and can accurately reflect the land surface tilt of the Green Silk Road areas. It can be used in the fields of Surveying and mapping, remote sensing, environmental resources, agricultural and forestry land planning, urban planning, disaster monitoring, hydropower engineering, military and other resources, environment and social economy.",

In recent years, with the deepening research on the interrelationships among regional population, resources, environment, and development, numerous geoscience, resource science, and environmental scholars both domestically and internationally have regarded topographic relief as an important indicator for regional resource and environmental assessment. They have evaluated regional soil erosion sensitivity, freeze-thaw erosion sensitivity, soil and water loss, geological environment, and ecological environment conditions. The Lancang-Mekong River is an international river, with a total length of approximately 4,900 km and a total basin area of about 810,000 km², flowing through six countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The topographic conditions influence the ecological environment pattern of the basin and the formation and distribution of water resources, which is of great significance for understanding the water resource system and ecological environment status of the basin."

First, GIS technology was employed to perform an ALBERS equal-area conic projection transformation on the original data, resulting in an accuracy equivalent to 90 m × 90 m for SRTM3. The latitude raster data was derived from vector latitude line data, which was converted into raster data using the Convert Features to Raster tool in ArcGIS software. Based on the 90 m × 90 m digital elevation model (DEM), this paper quantitatively calculated the terrain undulation of the Lancang-Mekong River Basin using window analysis and statistical methods, revealing the topographical features of the entire Lancang-Mekong River Basin. Furthermore, it explored and analyzed the distribution patterns of terrain undulation in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin from two aspects: vertical zonation and latitudinal distribution patterns."

Areas with higher topographic relief have a lower proportion of flat land, and vice versa.

(3) The topographic relief of the Lancang-Mekong River basin presents a spatial pattern of higher relief in the north and lower relief in the south, with a clear latitudinal distribution pattern. High values are mainly distributed in the Hengduan Mountains region, while low values are found in the lower Mekong region; there are five peaks in topographic relief along the latitude, from south to north, increasing from low to high at 12°, 16°, 19°, 25°, and 29°, located in the following areas: the Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia, the hilly areas in the southern part of the Annam Mountains in Laos, the central and northern parts of the Annam Mountains, the confluence of the middle and lower sections of the Lancang River, and the Hengduan Mountains region in the southeastern corner of Tibet."

                "Tropical mountainous areas not only provide substantial carbon storage and play an important role in global biological diversity, but also provide basic livelihood for a large number of poor ethnic minorities. Mountainous areas comprise one of the five primary terrains, accounting for approximately 27% of the earth’s land surface. Globally, mountainous areas include extremely important ecosystems. They represent not only the primary forms of storage for natural resources and biological diversity, but also serve as significant sources of livelihood for local ethnic minorities. Currently, tropical mountainous areas are typical environmentally vulnerable and ecologically sensitive areas due to intensified human activities. Characterizing the extent and area of mountainous areas in the tropics is necessary for implementing global collaborative programs, such as the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD, or REDD+ later) and International Programme of Biodiversity Science (DIVERSITAS). However, there is still no unified and standard definition typology for global mountainous areas, for example, the mountainous areas of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), let alone explicit boundaries. In the past, landforms (e.g., elevation or slope) were mainly delineated manually through field surveys or by interpreting aerial photographs. To date, the global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has been a widely used data source for studies and applications in mountainous areas, including the extraction of topographical factors, terrain relief, and landform classification. There are several commonly and interactively used datasets for global DEMs, such as the Global 30-Arc-Second Elevation Data (GTOPO 30; 30 arc second), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM; 3 and 1 arc seconds), Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED 2010; 30, 15, and 7.5 arc seconds), and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM; 1 arc second). The recent development of global DEMs data at various resolutions allows researchers to re-evaluate mountain-related studies. A number of studies have been widely devoted to delineating and classifying mountainous areas by introducing terrain relief or local elevation range (LER) using DEM data."

Due to the limited spatial resolution of GTOPO 30 (30 arc second) and GMTED 2010 (30, 15, and 7.5 arc seconds), some application demands cannot be satisfied.
