            "description": "The Himalayas is the most majestic, tall and young folded mountain system on earth. Before Eocene, the Himalayas were in a long-term sinking shallow sea environment. Under the action of extremely strong Himalayan movement, the Himalayas rose from the sea. By the end of tertiary, it had risen to a high mountain with an average height of more than 3000 meters. Therefore, under the influence of global climate change, Mount Everest has experienced several major Pleistocene glaciations, leaving behind various glacial related sediments and interglacial deposits. In 1960, the scientific investigation team of the Chinese Everest mountaineering team and the scientific investigation team of the Chinese xishabangma mountaineering team in 1964 conducted a more detailed investigation on the glaciers and other Quaternary sediments in the two peaks and their adjacent areas. During the scientific investigation of Mount Qomolangma from 1966 to 1968, on the basis of previous work, the Quaternary glacial deposits characteristic of this area were further investigated, and the research on various deposits in interglacial period and post glacial period was strengthened, so as to find some complete and typical quaternary stratigraphic profiles.\nThis data set comes from the field investigation of the scientific research team in this book. Outline\nThis paper introduces the spatial distribution characteristics of Quaternary sediments, focuses on several main quaternary stratigraphic profiles, preliminarily establishes the sequence of Quaternary strata in this area and discusses the age of strata.\nIt lays a foundation for in-depth discussion of Quaternary glaciation, paleoclimate and the rise of Himalayas in this area.",
