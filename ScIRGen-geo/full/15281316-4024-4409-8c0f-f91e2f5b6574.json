Climate warming may result in the release of CO2 from both the thawing of permafrost and accelerated autotrophic respiration, but it may also increase the fixation of CO2 by plants, which could relieve or even offset the CO2 losses. The Tibetan Plateau contains the largest area of alpine permafrost on Earth. However, the current status of the net CO2 balance and feedbacks to warming remain unclear, given that the region has recently experienced an atmospheric warming rate of over 0.3 °C decade−1. High-latitude and high-altitude regions have a harsh, cold climate that favors the storage of carbon (C) in the entire soil column, including the permafrost layer. This permafrost contains the largest store of C in terrestrial ecosystems (roughly 1,320 Pg C). These cold ecosystems have experienced a much greater rate of climate warming (0.3 °C decade−1) than the 0.12 °C decade−1 of warming across the global land surface as a whole. The Tibetan Plateau ranges from <3,000 to 8,844 m in altitude and is the largest region of alpine permafrost on Earth, contributing 10% to the global store of permafrost C. The Tibetan Plateau has experienced climate warming of 0.3 °C decade−1 in the atmospheric temperature and an increase in precipitation since the 1960s."

A lack of long-term observation may also add uncertainty to our calculation, despite about half of the sites providing only 1 y of data. Notably, the FluxCom dataset covers only two sites on the Tibetan Plateau (Haibei and Dangxiong), which may have reduced its ability to capture the CO2 fluxes in this region. Long-term observations with regular maintenance and quality control of the eddy covariance data would provide solid proof to validate our finding that the uptake of CO2 by plants will outpace the loss of CO2 from permafrost and plant respiration on the Tibetan Plateau in the future."

We then analyze the drivers of the spatial pattern, with specific emphasis on the altitude-dependent pattern given the importance of altitudinal variation to high mountains like the Tibetan Plateau. The eddy covariance dataset was used to constrain a process-based model and project future changes in the CO2 balance under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 to 8.5 scenarios using temperature and precipitation projections from 18 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. To provide ground-based evidence about the feedback of the CO2 balance of the alpine permafrost regions to warming, we also explored how the exchange of CO2 reacts to changes in climate by examining 16 manipulated experiments across the Tibetan Plateau."
