            "description": "This data is the annual distribution dataset of ecosystem types for the China Nepal transportation corridor (50km on both sides of the China Nepal kilometer) from 1992 to 2022. The spatial resolution is 1km and the data format is TIFF. The original data comes from the Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) dataset of the European Aviation Authority's Climate Change Initiative project（ https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/ ）This dataset uses the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN FAO), providing 22 types of land use worldwide with an overall accuracy of 70.46% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.67. Due to the fact that the original data is on a global scale and has a large amount of data, in order to facilitate users to conduct relevant research on the China Nepal transportation corridor area, based on the actual surface coverage of the China Nepal transportation corridor and its data description, we have reclassified it into 8 ecosystem types, namely farmland ecosystem, forest ecosystem, grassland ecosystem, water ecosystem, and urban ecosystem The bare land ecosystem and wetland ecosystem were subjected to cropping and reprojection of the original data using vector data from the China Nepal transportation corridor and ArcGIS Pro software.",

It uses the United Nations FAO's Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) to provide 22 types of land use globally, with an overall accuracy of 70.46% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.67. This dataset is used as a basis for ecosystem classification by reclassifying global data to reflect local ecological systems, such as those along the China-Nepal transportation corridor, which are categorized into eight ecosystem types: cropland, forest, grassland, water, urban, bare land, and wetland ecosystems.",

                    "Answer": "The reclassification of global land cover data into specific ecosystem types for regional studies may be due to the vast geographical scope and diverse ecological characteristics present in global datasets, which require adaptation to accurately reflect local conditions. The original global dataset provides 22 types of land cover, but to better suit the regional focus of the 中尼交通廊道, the data was reclassified into 8 ecosystem types based on actual land cover and data descriptions specific to the area.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using global land cover data from the Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) dataset, which is originally in a global scope and has a detailed classification system. First, the data is reclassified into eight ecosystem types based on the actual surface cover of the 中尼交通廊道 region. This involves mapping the 22 global land use types into categories like cropland, forest, grassland, water body, urban, bare land, and wetland ecosystems. The spatial data is then processed using ArcGIS Pro software to cut and reproject the data, ensuring it fits the specific geographical area of interest, which is 50 km on either side of the 中尼交通廊道. The spatial resolution is maintained at 1 km, and the data is presented in TIFF format, ready for further analysis.",
