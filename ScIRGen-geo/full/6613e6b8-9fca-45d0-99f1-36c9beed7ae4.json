            "description": "1) The dataset includes the raster data of soil erosion intensity in Pan-Third Pole 65 countries.2) The data of soil erosion intensity are obtained by using the Chinese soil loss equation (CSLE). The formula of soil erosion prediction model includes rainfall erosivity factor, soil erodibility factor, slope length factor, slope factor, vegetation cover and biological measure factor, engineering measure factor and tillage measure factor. Rainfall erodibility factors are calculated from the daily rainfall data by the US Climate Prdiction Center (CPC); soil erodibility factors are calculated by 250 m soil grid data; engineering measure factors are calculated based on vegetation cover, land use and rainfall erosivity ratio; tillage measure factors haven't been considered yet, and the default value is 1; slope length factors and slope factors are obtained by resampling after calculating 30 m elevation data; vegetation coverage and biological measures factors are obtained by combining fractional vegetation cover with land use data and rainfall erodibility proportionometer. The fractional vegetation cover  is calculated by MODIS vegetation index products through pixel dichotomy. 3) Compared with the data of soil erosion intensity in the same region in the same year, there is no significant difference and the data quality is good.4) the data of soil erosion intensity is of great significance for studying the present situation of soil erosion in Pan third polar 65 countries and better implementation of the development policy of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.",

Rainfall erosivity is derived from daily rainfall data by the US Climate Prediction Center, and soil erodibility is calculated using 250m SoilGrid data. Slope factors are derived from 30m elevation data, and vegetation cover is calculated using MODIS vegetation index products. These methods are specific to the 65 countries in the Pan-Third Pole region and are designed to align with the Belt and Road Initiative. In comparison, other global regions may use different models or data sources, which might not consider the same combination of factors or the specific data resolutions employed here.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy and reliability of soil erosion intensity data collection in the Pan-Third Pole region are influenced by several factors, including the use of the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) model which incorporates various elements such as rainfall erosivity factor, soil erodibility factor, slope length and steepness factors, vegetation cover and biological measures factor, and tillage measures factor. The rainfall erosivity factor is derived from daily precipitation data from the U.S. Climate Prediction Center (CPC), while the soil erodibility factor utilizes 250m SoilGrid soil data. Tillage measures factor is calculated using vegetation cover combined with land use and rainfall erosivity ratio, and slope factors are calculated from 30m elevation data. Vegetation cover is determined from MODIS vegetation index products using a pixel dichotomy method. These comprehensive methodologies contribute to the dataset's quality and accuracy, enabling better understanding and policy implementation for soil erosion management in the region.",

Vegetation cover and biological measures are computed using vegetation cover data combined with land use data and rainfall erosivity ratios, where vegetation cover is obtained from MODIS vegetation index products through a pixel dichotomy method. Engineering measures are currently not considered and temporarily set to a value of 1. The cropland management factor utilizes vegetation cover combined with land use and rainfall erosivity ratios.",
