These monthly means are used to assess the model's response to changes in variables such as soil temperature. In this context, data collection involves running the CESM2 model under different scenarios, collecting output data on various climate-related variables, and processing these outputs to generate monthly averages, which are then used for model evaluation and comparison.",

This approach may differ from other Earth system models where different platforms, adjustment parameters, or software tools might be used for similar model level adjustments and ensemble calculations.",

By analyzing these patterns, researchers can better understand the sensitivity of climate models to soil temperature changes, which can inform future data collection strategies by emphasizing the need for accurate soil temperature measurements and adjustments in climate simulations. This understanding might lead to more refined models that can predict climate trends with greater accuracy, particularly in regions where soil temperature plays a critical role in climate dynamics.",

This involves adjusting soil temperature within the FHIST_BGC compset to simulate various quantities, which includes latitude, longitude, and model level information. The data collection methods are influenced by the need to ensure that the simulation accurately reflects real-world conditions and supports robust model evaluation. By adjusting soil temperature and employing a systematic approach to calculate ensemble means, researchers aim to refine the model's predictive capabilities and improve its sensitivity analysis.",

This procedural adjustment is crucial for ensuring that the simulations accurately reflect the desired conditions for model evaluation. The ensemble mean calculation is performed using the NCAR Command Language (NCL) on the output data generated on the Cheyenne supercomputer. This process is necessary to obtain a representative average of multiple simulations, which aids in evaluating the model’s performance and understanding the impacts of soil temperature changes on various simulated quantities.",
