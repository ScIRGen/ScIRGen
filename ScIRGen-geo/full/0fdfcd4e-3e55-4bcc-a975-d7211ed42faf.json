            "description": "The aim of the simultaneous observation of river surface temperature is obtaining the river surface temperature of different places, while the sensor of thermal infrared go into the experimental areas of artificial oases eco-hydrology on the middle stream. All the river surface temperature data will be used for validation of the retrieved river surface temperature from thermal infrared sensor and the analysis of the scale effect of the river surface temperature, and finally serve for the validation of the plausibility checks of the surface temperature product from remote sensing.\n1. Observation sites and other details\nTen river sections were chosen to observe surface temperature simultaneously in the midstream of Heihe River Basin on 3 July and 4 July, 2012, including Sunan Bridge, Binhe new area, Heihe Bridge, Railway Bridge, Wujiang Bridge, Gaoya Hydrologic Station, Banqiao, Pingchuan Bridge, Yi’s Village, Liu’s Bridge. Self-recording point thermometers (observed once every 6 seconds) were used in Railway Bridge and Gaoya Hydrologic Station while handheld infrared thermometers (observed once of the river section temperature for every 15 minutes) were used in other eight places.\n2. Instrument parameters and calibration\nThe field of view of the self-recording point thermometer and the handheld infrared thermometer are 10 and 1 degree, respectively. The emissivity of the latter was assumed to be 0.95. All instruments were calibrated on 6 July, 2012 using black body during observation.\n3. Data storage\nAll the observation data were stored in excel.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
