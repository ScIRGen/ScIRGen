            "description": "HOBO water temperature loggers (U22-001, Onset Corp., USA) were used to monitor changes in water temperature with an accuracy of ±0.2 oC. Two water temperature profiles were installed in Paiku Co’s southern (0-42 m in depth) and northern (0-72 m in depth) basins (Fig. 1). In the southern basin, water temperature was monitored at the depths of 0.4 m, 5m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 30 m and 40 m. In the northern basin, water temperature was monitored at the depths of 0.4 m, 10 m, 20 m, 40 m, 50 m, 60 m and 70 m.\nTo investigate local hydro-meteorology at Paiku Co, air temperature and specific humidity over the lake were monitored since June 2015 by using HOBO air temperature and humidity loggers (U12-012, Onset Corp., USA). The logger was installed in an outcrop ~2 m above the lake surface at the north part of the lake (Fig. 2).\nLake evaporation was calculated using the energy budget (Bowen-ratio) method。",

                    "Question": "How might variations in lake water temperature across different depths, as measured hourly with HOBO thermometers, reveal insights into the thermal stratification processes in high-altitude lakes from 2015 to 2018?",
                    "Answer": "The hourly variations in lake water temperature across different depths can indicate how temperature layers form and interact within the lake. By analyzing these variations, particularly the differences between the southern lake center with a depth of 42 meters and the northern lake center with a depth of 72 meters, researchers can infer the presence and stability of thermal stratification. This can help in understanding how external factors, such as atmospheric temperature changes, influence the thermal dynamics of high-altitude lakes over the observed period.",

                    "Answer": "Using the energy balance method for calculating lake surface evaporation allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the hydrological balance, as it integrates various atmospheric and environmental conditions. This method contributes to more accurate estimates of lake water volume changes, which is crucial for understanding lake dynamics and managing water resources. However, the accuracy may be affected by the precision of input data such as atmospheric temperature and humidity.",

These sensors are placed at intervals of 5 meters in the southern lake center and 10 meters in the northern lake center, with depths of 42 meters and 72 meters respectively. Measurements are taken hourly and averaged daily to ensure accuracy.",
