            "titleEn": "WATER: Dataset of airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) mission in the Linze-Biandukou flight zone on May 25 2008",
            "description": "This dataset was acquired on May 25, 2008 by the L&K-band airborne microwave radiometer at the Linze-Biandukou flight area.The L-band frequency is 1.4 GHz, the rear view is 35 degrees, and the dual-polarization (H and V) information is obtained; the K-band frequency is 18.7 GHz, with zenith angle observation, and there is no polarization information. The plane took off from Zhangye Airport at 9:51 (Beijing time, the same below) and landed at 15:01. The observation from 10:10 to 12:30 was in the Linze area, the flight altitude is about 1800m, and the flight speed is about 250km/hr. The plane flew low over Linze Reservoir from 12:31 to 12:38. The plane works  in the Bianduko aerophotography region from13:13 to 14:35, the flight altitude is about 3000m, and the flight speed is about 250km/hr.\nThe original data is divided into two parts: microwave radiometer data and GPS data. The L and K bands of microwave radiometer are all from non-imaging observation, the digital values obtained from instantaneous observation are recorded by text files, the longitude and latitude of flight and the attitude parameters of aircraft are recorded by GPS data. At the same time, through the respective clock records of the microwave radiometer and GPS, the microwave observation can be linked with the GPS record, and the microwave observation can be matched with the geographical coordinate information. Due to the relatively low resolution of the microwave radiometer, the  leeway, welter and pitching of the aircraft are generally neglected in data processing. According to the target of use and relative flight altitude (H), after calibration and coordinate matching, the observation information can be rasterized. The resolution (x) of the L and K bands can be considered consistent with the observation footprint. The reference resolution is: L band, x = 0.3H; K band, x = 0.24H. After the above steps, products that can be directly used by users can be  obtained.",

                    "Answer": "L&K band airborne microwave radiometer data refers to measurements collected using airborne microwave radiometers that operate at L band (1.4GHz) and K band (18.7GHz) frequencies. These measurements are acquired during flight operations to observe specific areas, capturing dual polarization information at the L band and non-polarized data at the K band. The data includes microwave radiometer readings and GPS data, which are combined to provide geographic context. The raw data needs to be calibrated to convert digital values into brightness temperatures, and can be processed further to align with geographic coordinates and create grid-based products with specific resolutions based on flight altitude.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of using L&K band airborne microwave radiometers over the Linze-Biandukou flight area is to capture high-resolution brightness temperature data that can be transformed into valuable land surface parameters. This approach enhances our understanding by providing dual-polarization information at the L band and zenith angle observations at the K band, which are crucial for analyzing soil moisture content and other surface characteristics. The methodology allows for the integration of microwave and GPS data to assign geographical coordinates to the observations, facilitating accurate spatial analysis and modeling of environmental phenomena.",

These calibration coefficients are archived together with the original observational data. The integration of geographical coordinate information into the observations is achieved by linking microwave observation records with GPS data through their respective clock records, matching microwave observations with geographic coordinates.",
