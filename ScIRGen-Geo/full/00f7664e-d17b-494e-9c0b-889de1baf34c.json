      "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the mixed forest station eddy covariance system (EC) in the downstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2018. The site (101.1335° E, 41.9903° N) was located in the Sidaoqiao County, in Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region . The elevation is 874 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3.2 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500) was 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. Data during February 7 to 11, 2018 were missing due to the power loss.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The major methods used for estimating surface fluxes are field measurement, remote-sensing-based methods, and land surface modeling. The variability in field measurements of surface flux has been documented over diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales.",

New techniques such as data assimilation are needed to integrate either field or remotely sensed observations with the models, thus improving model accuracy by correcting the model state variables and parameters. Data assimilation has played an increasingly important role in improving predictions of such land surface state variables as the leaf area index, soil temperature profile, soil moisture profile, and other related variables, e.g., surface fluxes.",

Visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR) is one of the 11 sensors mounted on the FY-3A satellite and has a nominal spatial resolution of approximately 1 km×1 km at the nadir.

In CoLM, soil moisture is important for dividing the net radiation into the ground heat, sensible, and latent heat fluxes.",

Generally, the diurnal variation trends of the land surface temperature and surface flux can be predicted correctly using the CoLM. The daily averaged evaporation fraction (EF, ratio between latent heat flux and available energy) can be used to describe the splitting of available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes. The LAS instrument can measure the sensible heat flux at a larger scale than the EC system."

The deviations between the FY3A-VIRR LST data and the ground measurements are determined by many factors. The terrain effect can affect the accuracy of the FY3A-VIRR LST retrievals. The mismatch of the spatial and temporal scales between the FY3A-VIRR and field-measured LST can also cause these biases.",
        "The differences between the sensible heat fluxes measured by the EC and LAS system are primarily caused by the energy imbalance of the EC, the heterogeneity of the underlying surfaces, and the differences between the source areas of the EC and LAS measurements. Because of the short memory of the land surface temperature, it is difficult to assimilate the land surface temperatures. Directly assimilating land surface temperature to optimize soil moisture may cause model simulations that are more unstable."
