                    "Answer": "Spatial distribution data refers to the geographic representation of transportation and pipeline networks, such as highways, railways, and pipelines, within the 中蒙俄经济走廊. This includes mapping their locations and changes over time, specifically for the years 1990, 2015, and 2020, using tools like ArcGIS 10.2 and remote sensing imagery.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution data of roads, railways, and pipelines over the years 1990, 2015, and 2020 provide insights into the growth and evolution of transportation infrastructure in the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor. The data can show how the network of transportation has expanded or shifted, indicating economic growth, strategic infrastructure development, and possibly changes in trade routes or economic priorities. By analyzing these patterns, researchers can understand the broader implications on regional connectivity and economic integration, as well as potential impacts on ecological environments.",

                    "Answer": "The key procedural steps include downloading remote sensing imagery of the 中蒙俄经济走廊 region from the NASA website, using ArcGIS 10.2 software for manual interpretation to extract roads and railways, marking map features with the help of a Russian atlas, and manually annotating pipeline data by referencing relevant maps. The process involves creating spatial distribution maps for different years (1990, 2015, and 2020) at a scale of 1:2500000 to clearly reflect changes in transportation and pipeline infrastructure over the past 30 years.",
