            "description": "The  active layer thickness is not only an important index to study the thermal state of permafrost area, but also a key factor to be considered in engineering construction in permafrost area . Aalto et al. proposed a statistical modeling method to predict the current situation and change of the active layer thickness. The method is based on the R package and is calculated and compared by four models (GLM, GAM, GBM and random forest). The model takes into account the common effects of climatic conditions (freezing index, thawing index and snow / rain), topographic conditions (DEM) and soil conditions (soil organic carbon content and soil water content), It can simulate the current situation active layer thickness in the circum-Arctic and the change of the active layer thickness under different climate scenarios in the future.",

These factors collectively affect the modeling outcomes and are key considerations in statistical modeling methods such as GLM, GAM, GBM, and random forest used to predict current and future changes in active layer thickness under different climate scenarios.",
