            "description": "As an important part of global semi-arid grassland, adequately understanding the spatio-temporal variability of evapotranspiration (ET) over the temperate semi-arid grassland of China (TSGC) could advance our understanding of climate, hydrological and ecological processes over global semi-arid areas. Based on the largest number of in-situ ET measurements (13 flux towers) within the TSGC, we applied the support vector regression method to develop a high-quality ET dataset at 1 km spatial resolution and 8-day timescale for the TSGC from 1982 to 2015. The model performed well in validation against flux tower‐measured data and comparison with water-balance derived ET.",

                "Semi-arid areas account for about 15% of global land area, which feeds about 14% of the global population. It’s a critical region for Earth’s climate due to the vast area, high sensitivity to global warming, significant feedbacks on the global climate system, and the fragile eco-environment to anthropogenic disturbances. The temperate semi-arid grassland of China (TSGC) constitutes an integral part of the Mongolian Plateau and Eurasian semi-arid steppe ecosystem. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominated component (i.e., 80-90% of precipitation) of the hydrologic cycle over the arid and semi-arid regions. The change in water balance (WB, the sum of the total runoff and the change in the total terrestrial water storage, defined as precipitation-ET) is also a key aspect of the water cycle and is considered as the primary indicator of water availability. However, accurately estimating ET remains challenging in the arid and semi-arid areas where the two main types of models for ET estimation (i.e., process-based and remote sensing-based ET model) generally performed worse than in humid areas. The poor performance of process-based ET models in arid and semi-arid ecosystems is mainly because they require extensive and accurate parameterizations of land surface factors, which are highly variable in these regions. The challenges for remote sensing-based ET models in this region include low vegetation signal-to-noise ratios, high spatial heterogeneity from plot to regional scales, and irregular growing seasons due to unpredictable seasonal rainfall and frequent periods of drought. Machine learning (or data-driven) approaches have been identified as the most suitable approach for ET estimation, and was applied to upscale the eddy-covariance (EC) flux tower measurements from site to region scale using remote sensing, meteorological reanalysis, and land cover data."

Overall, although the SVR-ET model was not constrained by water balance, the predicted ET coincided with the magnitude and variability of the ET estimation based on the catchment water balance equation."
