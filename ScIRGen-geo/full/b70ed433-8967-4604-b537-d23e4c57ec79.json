(2015). Agriculture facilitated permanent human occupation of the Tibetan Plateau after 3600 BP. Science, 347, 248–250.\". \nIn this paper, researchers analyzed animal bones, plant remains and other artefacts from 53 sites across the northeastern Tibetan plateau and found that humans began to relocate to the elevations above 4000 masl after the emergence of Barley. According to the study, the prehistoric human expansion into the higher, colder altitudes of the Tibetan plateau took place as the continental temperatures had themselves become colder after 3,600 calendar years before the present, thus, the key impetus of the expansion was agricultural innovation rather than climate change.\nThis dataset contains 4 tables, table names and content are as follows:\nData list: The data name list of the rest tables;\nt1: Calibrated radiocarbon dates and domesticated plant and animal remains from sites investigated on the NETP;\nt2: Radiocarbon dates of the Paleolithic sites on the Tibetan Plateau;\nt3: OSL dates of the Paleolithic sites on the Tibetan Plateau.\nSee attachments for data details: Supplementary Materials.pdf, Agriculture Facilitated Permanent Human Occupation of the Tibetan Plateau after 3,600 BP.pdf.",

Early studies of the mechanisms underlying the spread of wheat and barley considered a single aspect of crop growth patterns: length of the growing season. In particular, models based on a crop’s accumulated heat requirements—growing degree days (GDD)—predict that wheat and barley are more adapted to growth in high-latitude and high-altitude Eurasia than millets. Local ecology and climate, coupled with crop phenology, thus had a marked impact on crop adoption in high-altitude environments, one that differed substantially from the lowlands."

It is necessary to clearly define past crop niches to create better models for the complex history of the occupation of the plateau.

                    "Answer": "The potential for both hunter-gatherers and pastoralists to move grains outside of the cultivated niche necessitates caution when discussing agricultural permanence. Disentangling the spread of crops and pastoral animals requires better evidence, robust models, and complex narratives to interpret discrepancies between archaeological data and models of human behavior.",

                    "Answer": "Clearly defining past crop niches is necessary to create better models for understanding the complex history of human occupation on the plateau. This is because the growing requirements of crops like barley need to be accurately assessed to determine the feasibility of their cultivation at high altitudes.",

                    "Answer": "The use of radiocarbon and OSL dating is crucial in establishing a timeline of human settlement, as it provides empirical evidence of the age of archaeological sites. These methods can help disentangle the timing of agricultural innovations and human occupation in high-altitude environments, although they must be interpreted cautiously due to potential discrepancies in dating results.",

                    "Answer": "Distinguishing between human-induced agricultural spread and natural ecological changes is challenging, particularly in high-altitude environments where minor climatic variations can significantly impact agriculture. This requires robust models and complex narratives to interpret archaeological data alongside ecological and climatic factors.",

                    "Answer": "Expanding datasets to include detailed data on crop phenology could be beneficial for understanding high-altitude adaptation. It would allow for more precise modeling of crop niches and growth requirements, potentially offering insights into historical agricultural practices and human settlement patterns at high altitudes.",

The dataset includes calibrated radiocarbon dates and remains of domesticated plants and animals, which help in analyzing the timeline and impact of agricultural innovations like the introduction of barley in facilitating human settlements in these regions.",

Better evidence and more robust models are needed to interpret the mismatch between archaeological data and human behavior models, as mentioned in the research objectives and challenges.",

                    "Answer": "The analysis involved examining animal bones, plant remains, and artifacts from 53 sites in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Future research could adapt these methods by incorporating advanced dating techniques or integrating remote sensing technologies to enhance the spatial analysis of high-altitude environments.",
