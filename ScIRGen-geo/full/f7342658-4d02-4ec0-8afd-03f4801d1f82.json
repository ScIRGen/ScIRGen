Within CMIP6, the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) aims to generate multi-model climate projections for alternate scenarios of future emissions and land-use changes produced with integrated assessment models. The US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project is a new and ongoing climate modeling effort to develop a state-of-the-art Earth system model. The E3SM project aims to develop code optimized for DOE’s high-performance computing infrastructure and to advance Earth system prediction of changes in environmental variables that are critical to energy-sector decisions, such as regional trends in air and water temperatures, water availability, storms and heavy precipitation, coastal flooding, and sea-level rise (Bader et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020). E3SM version 1.0 (E3SMv1.0) at the standard horizontal resolution of ∼100 km reported a high ECS of 5.3 K, a high transient climate response (TCR) of 2.93 K, along with a strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFaero) of −1.65 W m−2 (Golaz et al., 2019). Previous estimates found that the net positive cloud feedback of 0.94 W m−2 K−1 in E3SMv1.0 is too strong compared with other CMIP6 models at the range of 0.42 ±0.36 W m−2 K−1 (Zelinka et al., 2020, Table S1)."

Secondly, we describe regional responses of key climate components in the GHG-only simulations. The difference between the high-emission all-forcing experiment and the GHG-only experiment is analyzed."

The GHG-only future projection simulations (future_Pn-SSP5-8.5-GHG) use the end of the historical_Hn simulations as the starting points and use the GHG forcing in the SSP5-8.5 scenario, while the other forcings are still set at the same pre-industrial values as historical_Hn-GHG."

The global mean precipitation in E3SMv1.0 increases by >0.3 mm d−1 from the end of the historical period (year 2014) to the end of the future projection (year 2099). The global mean Tair changes in the E3SMv1.0 ensemble members are comparable to the CMIP6 models with the highest warming. The global pattern of Tair change between 2070–2099 and 1985–2014 reveals a polar amplification of surface warming and interhemispheric asymmetric warming. The global mean precipitation increases by ∼10 % due to the warmer climate."

This approach allows for isolated analysis of GHG impacts but may miss interactions with other forcings present in all-forcing scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "The latest CMIP phase 6 models simulate a higher ensemble ECS with a larger spread due to differences in model configurations, such as the strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing and cloud feedbacks that vary across models, as indicated in the background content.",

                    "Answer": "Simulating regional climate responses presents significant challenges, especially in accurately capturing precipitation patterns. The complexities arise due to factors like spatial and temporal variability, which can lead to discrepancies between model projections and observed climate behavior. This is evident in the difficulty of modeling severe precipitation reduction in drying regions during different seasons.",

                    "Answer": "Ensemble simulations, such as those conducted in the E3SM LS4P Task 4, involve running multiple instances of climate models to account for variability and uncertainty. These simulations use different initial conditions or model parameters to generate a range of possible outcomes. This approach helps in understanding the spread and robustness of future climate projections. The ensemble mean data from these simulations provides an average prediction, reducing individual model biases and improving reliability.",

The drying regions, for example, experience more severe precipitation reduction during boreal summer than in boreal winter, complicating the interpretation of data. Additionally, the simulated mean and change of sea surface temperature (SST) do not show a clear linear relationship, as SST is influenced by multiple factors at varying temporal and spatial scales.",

For example, the study mentioned uses only one ensemble member (r1i1p1f1) of the CMIP6 model runs for analysis. This selection can be crucial to ensure that the study captures a representative climate projection while managing computational resources effectively.",

In the context of GHG-only simulations, the model settings are adjusted such that all forcings other than GHG are held at pre-industrial values. This involves conducting ensemble members for both historical and future projection periods, utilizing atmospheric and land components to analyze climate characteristics.",

This method allows for the analysis of regional climate responses to GHG changes by comparing the outcomes of high-emission all-forcing experiments with GHG-only experiments, thereby shedding light on the differences and enhancing understanding of climate dynamics.",
