            "description": "This data set contains the high-resolution tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column concentration pomino v2.1 data in East Asia from 2012 to 2020. It is a new version of the data after bug fix of v2.0.1, which provides an important data basis for studying the spatial distribution characteristics and temporal change trend of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide in China. Based on the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide slant column concentration provided by KNMI, the pomino tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column concentration is calculated through the tropospheric AMF retrieval algorithm developed by ourselves. The comparison with the ground-based observation data shows that the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column concentration of pomino can better capture the day-to-day variation trend, and has better correlation with the ground-based observation data. At present, the data has been used for scientific research by many universities and scientific research institutions at home and abroad. In the future, the data set will provide more comprehensive data support for scientific research projects on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

Current representative OMI products covering China, DOMINO v2 and OMNO2 v2, do not explicitly account for the effect of aerosols on the solar radiation. Since aerosols affect the radiation field in retrieving both clouds and NO2, the net effect on the retrieved NO2 columns is unclear. This aerosol issue is particularly significant over East China due to its high aerosol loadings. In addition, the DOMINO and OMNO2 products also assume Lambertian surface with no dependence of surface reflectance on the geometry of the light path. DOMINO and OMNO2 adopt the vertical profile of NO2 simulated by coarse-resolution global chemical transport models (CTMs), TM4 at 3° long. × 2° lat. for DOMINO v2 and GMI at 2.5° long. × 2° lat. for OMNO2 v2, which are unable to capture the variability of NO2 at smaller scales."

Prior to the NO2 retrieval, we derive the cloud information using consistent ancillary assumptions.

Compared to DOMINO v2, our retrieval better captures the day-to-day variability in MAX-DOAS NO2 data (R2 = 0.96 versus 0.72), due to pixel-specific radiative transfer calculations rather than the use of a look-up table, explicit inclusion of aerosols, and consideration of surface reflectance anisotropy. Our retrieved NO2 columns are 54% of the MAX-DOAS data on average, reflecting the inevitable spatial inconsistency between the two types of measurement, errors in MAX-DOAS data, and uncertainties in our OMI retrieval related to aerosols and vertical profile of NO2."

However, NO2 retrieved from OMI and other spaceborne instruments is subject to errors in the conversion process from radiance to VCD, particularly with respect to the calculation of tropospheric air mass factor (AMF) that is used to convert tropospheric slant column density (SCD) to VCD. Most current-generation NO2 algorithms do not explicitly account for the effects of aerosols on NO2 AMFs and on prerequisite cloud parameter retrievals. In polluted situations with high aerosol loadings and more absorbing aerosol types, which often occur over China and many other developing regions, the implicit method can result in considerable biases. Lin et al. (2014b, 2015) established the POMINO NO2 algorithm, which builds on the DOMINO v2 algorithm (for OMI NO2 slant columns and stratospheric correction), but improves upon it through a more sophisticated AMF calculation over China.

                    "Answer": "Aerosol optical effects refer to the influence of aerosols on the radiation field, which affects the retrieval of both cloud properties and NO2 columns. These effects must be explicitly accounted for to reduce retrieval biases, particularly in regions with high aerosol loads. In NO2 data retrieval, incorporating aerosol optical effects improves the accuracy of the derived NO2 columns.",

                    "Answer": "High-resolution vertical profiles of NO2 are significant in atmospheric data collection as they provide detailed information on the distribution of NO2 at different altitudes. These profiles are crucial for improving the accuracy of NO2 retrievals from satellite data, allowing for better representation of spatial variability, especially in regions like China with complex emission sources and atmospheric conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The POMINO algorithm explicitly considers aerosol optical effects and surface reflectance anisotropy, enhancing the retrieval accuracy of NO2 columns by reducing aerosol interference. DOMINO v2 and OMNO2 v2 do not account for these aerosol effects, leading to potential biases, especially in regions with high aerosol loadings like East China.
