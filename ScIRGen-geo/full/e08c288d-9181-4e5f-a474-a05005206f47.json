            "description": "The dataset of intensive snow parameter measurements was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental area on Mar. 11, 2008. Those provide reliable data for retrieval of snow parameters from remote sensing approaches.\n     Observation items included the snow layer temperature by the probe thermometer, the snow grain size by the handheld microscope, snow density by the aluminum case, the snow surface temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer, and the snow-soil interface temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer in three plots in BG-Z. 4 points were selected and measured 4 times in each plot. Two files including raw data and preprocessed data (3 subfolders enclosed) on snow properties were archived; besides, profile pictures of each point were also included.",

Rather than using field measurements, remote sensing (RS) is now more widely used in modelling snow because of its unique advantages in obtaining large-scale ground information (Seidel and Martinec, 2004). The snow cover area (SCA) can be observed with higher spatial resolution at near-infrared and visible wavelengths (Hall and Riggs, 2006). The spatial and temporal variations in the snow are fundamentally driven by the energy and mass balance. However, the main disadvantage of the MODIS sensor is that it is unable to record observations in cloud-covered regions (Gafurov and Bardossy, 2009)."

Meteorological data were collected using two automatic weather stations (AWSs), Dadongshu Mountain Pass Snow Observation Station (DY) (4146.8 m, 100 ◦14 ′ E, 38 ◦01 ′ N) and Binggou Cold Region Meteorological Station (BG) (3449.4 m, 100 ◦13 ′ E, 38 ◦04 ′ N), during a complete snow accumulation-melt period from 1 November 2007 to 31 May 2008.

As described above, spatial and temporal SWE distribution can be retrieved effectively using MODIS data and the energy balance method. The simulation results indicate that almost half of MODIS image waste could have been avoided in the Binggou watershed in the snow season of 2008. The results indicate that in the alpine region without abundant ground gauges, it is practical and relatively accurate to simulate spatial and temporal snow distribution using snowcover information from RS data and observations from several local weather stations."

                    "Answer": "Snow characteristic data were collected through a series of field measurements in the snow season of 2008, which included measuring snow parameters such as snow temperature, snow grain size, snow density, surface temperature, and snow-soil interface temperature. These methods provided detailed in-situ observations essential for accurate snow parameter retrieval and modeling.",

                    "Question": "Please examine the challenges associated with using remote sensing data for snow monitoring in cloud-covered regions and propose potential solutions.",
                    "Answer": "The main challenge with remote sensing data, such as MODIS, is its inability to record observations in cloud-covered regions. This limitation affects the accuracy of snow accumulation and melt process modeling. Potential solutions could involve integrating additional data sources or employing modeling techniques like the energy balance method to account for cloud-covered areas and improve data accuracy.",
