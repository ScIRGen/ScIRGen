            "description": "This data covers the latest and most complete taxa of the Theru flora in eastern Tibet, collected through five field investigations between 2018 and 2020. The entire Relu flora includes at least 21 families and 31 genera in taxonomy, with a total of three combinations from bottom to top, namely TR1, TR2, and TR3. Among them, the TR1 combination, limited in age between 45 and 42 Ma, is mainly composed of Eucalyptus sp., Palibinia sp., Comptonia sp., and Fabaceae plants; The TR2 fossil assemblage is limited to around 42 Ma, with only Eucalyptus sp. being the dominant species. The TR3 fossil assemblage is limited to around 42 to 40 Ma, with the most abundant taxa. In addition to Eucalyptus sp., Pistacia sp., Ulmus sp., and Zelkova sp. are also present. TR1~TR3 together constitute the highly diverse Theru plant fossil group, which is currently the oldest known Cenozoic plant group in the Hengduan Mountains region, representing the emergence of biodiversity hotspots of Hengduan Mts.",

This approach allowed researchers to compile the most comprehensive and up-to-date assemblage of plant fossils, classified into three groups (TR1, TR2, TR3) based on stratigraphic and temporal criteria.",

These assemblages are used to classify and understand the biodiversity and ecological conditions of the past, with each assemblage representing a different time period and set of dominant plant species.",
