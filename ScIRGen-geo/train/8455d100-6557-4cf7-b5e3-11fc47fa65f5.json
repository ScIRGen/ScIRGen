            "description": "The data include: a brief introduction of the geodynamic evolution model of the formation of Cu Mo polymetallic granodiorite (porphyry) in Chizhou area. The changes of geological structure before and after 150mA in Chizhou area, as well as the changes of influence on metallogenic model, are shown in the figure. At 150 mA, Chizhou area was affected by the inversion of the paleo Pacific plate, forming an arc rift environment without marine sediments. The fluid released from the plate melted the mantle wedge material, produced a high oxygen fugacity environment, formed chlorine rich fluid and mixed mantle crust magma, promoted the extraction and migration of metals, and finally formed the copper molybdenum polymetallic deposit in Chizhou area.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable.

They could use geochemical analyses of rock samples to determine the oxidation conditions and fluid compositions that contributed to metal extraction and transport.

                    "Answer": "The geodynamic evolution model of the granodiorite porphyry formation in the Chizhou area involves changes in geological structures before and after 150 Ma and the impact on mineralization patterns. At 150 Ma, the Chizhou area was influenced by the subduction of the ancient Pacific plate, creating an intra-arc rift environment without oceanic sediments. Fluids released from the plate caused the melting of mantle wedge material, resulting in a high-oxidation environment, which formed chlorine-rich fluids and mixed mantle-crust magma, facilitating the extraction and transport of metals and ultimately forming copper-molybdenum polymetallic deposits in the Chizhou area.",

                    "Answer": "The data suggests that the Chizhou region underwent significant geological structural changes before and after 150Ma due to the influence of the subduction of the ancient Pacific Plate. These changes led to the formation of an intra-arc rift environment with no marine sediments. The release of fluids from the subducting plate caused melting of the mantle wedge materials, creating a high oxygen fugacity environment, enriched with chlorine fluids and mixed mantle-crust magmas. This facilitated metal extraction and transportation, ultimately forming the copper-molybdenum polymetallic deposits in the Chizhou area. Such inferences could impact mineral exploration methodologies by highlighting the importance of investigating tectonic settings and fluid compositions in understanding ore formation processes.",

These factors create a high oxygen fugacity environment, resulting in the formation of chlorine-rich fluids and mixed mantle-crust magma, which enhance metal extraction and transport, ultimately forming copper-molybdenum polymetallic deposits in the Chizhou region.",

                    "Answer": "Incorporating detailed imagery of pre- and post-150 Ma tectonic changes in the Chizhou region can enhance geological interpretation by providing insights into the structural evolution influenced by the ancient Pacific Plate's reversal. This understanding can elucidate the development of arc-related rift environments without marine sediments, which is crucial for interpreting the formation processes of copper-molybdenum polymetallic deposits. By examining these changes, researchers can better understand how fluid release from the plate led to mantle wedge melting, high oxygen fugacity environments, and the creation of chlorine-rich fluids and hybrid mantle-crust magmas, which facilitated metal extraction and transport, ultimately contributing to the region's mineralization.",

                    "Answer": "Investigating the geodynamic evolution model of the Chizhou area's copper-molybdenum polymetallic granodiorite (porphyry) is crucial to understand how geological structural changes before and after 150 million years ago influenced mineralization modes. This insight is significant because the Chizhou area was affected by the reversal of the ancient Pacific Plate, leading to an arc-rift environment without marine sediments.
