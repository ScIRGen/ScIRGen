            "description": "The project of material and energy exchange and community stability of soil-plant gas interface in oasis-gobi transition zone belongs to the major research program of \"environmental and ecological science in western China\" sponsored by the national natural science foundation, and is headed by professor Wang genxuan of Lanzhou university. the running time of the project is from January 2002 to December 2004.\nData collected for this project:\n1. Status of energy utilization rate of desert natural vegetation\nThe data is in Excel format. The individual size of plants and biomass of green photosynthetic tissue measured by randomly selecting some plants from the desert natural vegetation sample are mainly used to explore the energy utilization rate model of desert plants in this project, including variables such as average total biomass, average biomass of photosynthetic tissue and population density.\n2. Survey data on basic information of natural vegetation community institutions in sample plots\nThe data is in Excel format, including survey and analysis data of vegetation density and average underground biomass in Lanzhou, Baiyin and Jingtai.",
