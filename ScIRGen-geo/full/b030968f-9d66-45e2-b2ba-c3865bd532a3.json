It is expressed in geographic coordinates using the decimal degree. The main contents include: marsh wetland types, wetland water supply types, soil types, main vegetation types, geographical area, etc. Implemented the \"Standard for Information Classification and Coding of Sustainable Development Information Sharing System of China\". Data source of this database: 1:20 swamp map (internal version), Tibetan Plateau 1: 500,000 swamp map (internal version), swamp survey data 1: 1 million and national 1: 4 million swamp map; processing steps are: data source selection, preprocessing, digitization and encoding of marsh wetland elements, data editing processing, establishing topological relationships, edge processing, projection conversion, linking with attribute databases such as place names and obtaining attribute data.",

                    "Answer": "When using a dataset derived from multiple sources, such as 1:20, 1:50, and 1:400 million scale maps and surveys, the potential consequences on data accuracy and resolution include variations in detail and precision due to differing original data resolutions. While combining these sources can provide comprehensive coverage, it might introduce inconsistencies or errors if not carefully standardized or calibrated. The integration process, which involves steps like data source selection, preprocessing, and projection transformation, is crucial to maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the final product accurately reflects real-world conditions.",
