            "description": "This data set is composed of photoluminescence dating data of loess profiles in Luochuan (35 ° 43 ′ n, 109 ° 25 ′ E) and Xuyi (118 ° 39 ′ e, 32 ° 51 ′ n) in China, including the results of photoluminescence chronology of 45 samples. Among them, the luminescence chronology of 21 samples from Luochuan section of the Loess Plateau of China uses the potassium feldspar monolithic regeneration method (SAR) multi-step temperature rise post IR IRSL (met pirir) dating technique; The study on the luminescence chronology of 24 samples in Xuyi section is that 8 samples are based on the photoluminescence dating of 4-11 micron quartz particles according to the standard monolithic regeneration method (SAR) measurement process, and 8 samples are based on the infrared luminescence dating of 4-11 micron multi mineral fine particles heated to 225 ℃ (pir225) according to the monolithic regeneration method measurement process, And 8 samples based on the infrared luminescence dating of 4-11 micron multi mineral fine particles heated to 290 ℃ (pir290) according to the single chip regeneration method measurement process. The instrument used for the photoluminescence dating of Luochuan and Xuyi loess profiles is RIS ø thermoluminescence / photoluminescence dating instrument made in Denmark. The experimental analysis was completed in the Department of Geosciences of the University of Hong Kong and babes Bolyai University in Romania. The data provide further age constraints for the Loess in Luochuan and Xuyi, China, and are of great significance for the study of paleoclimate / Paleoenvironment in the two regions.",

                    "Answer": "The single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol is significant in luminescence dating as it allows for the precise measurement of the equivalent dose required to date samples, such as loess. In the context of Chinese loess sections, it provides a method to measure luminescence using feldspar or quartz particles, which helps to determine the age of sediment deposits accurately. This technique ensures systematic analysis through steps of preheating and measuring luminescence, contributing to reliable and repeatable age estimations, enhancing the understanding of paleoenvironmental conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The methodologies used for dating sediment samples in loess profiles involve the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) method with multi-step heating post-IR IRSL (MET-pIRIR) technology for potassium feldspar in the Chinese Loess Plateau's Luochuan profile, and the SAR method for quartz particles and IRSL dating for multi-mineral fine grains at different temperatures in the Xuyi profile. These methods provide age constraints that are significant for studying paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental changes in the Luochuan and Xuyi regions.",
