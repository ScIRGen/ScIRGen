            "description": "The data set mainly includes observation data of each tree in the super site, and the observation time is from June 2, 2008 to June 10, 2008. The super site is set around the Dayekou Guantan Forest Station. Since the size of the super site is 100m√ó100m, in order to facilitate the forest structure parameter survey, the super site is divided into 16 sub-sample sites, and tally forest measurement is performed in units of sub-samples. The tally forest measurement factors include: diameter, tree height, height under branch, crown width in transversal slope direction, crown width in up and down slope direction, and tindividual tree growth status. The measuring instruments are mainly: tape, diameter scale, laser altimeter, ultrasonic altimeter, range pole and compass. The data set also records the center point latitude and longitude coordinates of 16 sub-samples (measured by Z-MAX DGPS). The data set can be used for verification of remote sensing forest structure parameter extraction algorithm. The data set, together with other observation data of the super site, can be used for reconstruction of forest 3D scenes, establishment of active and passive remote sensing mechanism models, and simulation of remote sensing images,etc.",

                "Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and forest biomass carbon sequestration measures have become a significant component of global emission reduction efforts. Forest biomass is the energy basis and nutrient source for the operation of the entire forest ecosystem, and it is fundamental for studying forest productivity, net primary productivity, carbon cycling, and global change research. Currently, the estimation of regional forest biomass mainly relies on stratified sampling techniques that involve establishing a large number of ground measurement plots, followed by statistical methods for estimation. Methods based on radar and LiDAR have become a research hotspot both domestically and internationally. Traditional single-angle optical remote sensing data primarily provide spectral information and horizontal structural information of vegetation, lacking vertical structural information. As biomass increases, remote sensing signals are prone to saturation. Radar data with longer wavelengths can provide vertical structural information of vegetation; however, airborne and spaceborne polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar data are still quite difficult to obtain. The rapid development and commercialization of airborne systems currently offer a promising technological means for estimating forest parameters."

When generating the canopy height model, the number, values, and positions of the crown vertices will change after low-pass filtering and smoothing processing.

                    "Answer": "Using point cloud data can provide a detailed canopy height model to estimate individual tree structure parameters, which is beneficial for accurately estimating biomass. However, limitations include the potential mismatch of individual trees due to localization errors, which may not fully represent the entire sample plot, thereby challenging the extrapolation to regional scale biomass estimates.",

                    "Answer": "Radar and LiDAR technologies can offer vertical structure information of vegetation, which traditional optical remote sensing lacks. This integration can overcome saturation issues that occur with increased biomass using optical data alone, potentially leading to more accurate and reliable biomass estimates.",

                    "Answer": "Estimation of regional forest biomass typically involves setting up numerous ground-measured sample plots using stratified sampling techniques. Radar and LiDAR-based methods provide additional vertical structure information of vegetation, which is crucial due to the saturation effect in optical remote sensing data as biomass increases. However, further research is needed to expand single-tree biomass estimation methods to regional scales, given the partial matching of trees in sample plots.",

This process involves optimizing algorithms for processing point clouds and recognizing tree crown features. A new smoothing algorithm for raster data is used to maintain the accuracy of crown vertex numbers, values, and positions after low-pass filtering.",

                    "Answer": "Positioning errors impact the matching of single trees during estimation. To address this, only a portion of trees that can be accurately matched are used for estimation. Consequently, developing methods to extend these findings to larger scales remains a challenge, as the matched trees represent only a subset of the total trees in a sample plot.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods for a forest plot of this size may include the use of tools like tape measures, diameter tapes, laser altimeters, ultrasonic altimeters, and compasses. These instruments can help measure tree diameter at breast height, tree height, branch height, crown widths in different directions, and individual tree growth conditions.

This issue can be addressed by improving the accuracy of tree matching techniques and ensuring the growth equations are robust enough to be generalized to larger areas. Optimizing algorithms for processing point cloud data and refining tree crown feature recognition algorithms can also help overcome these challenges.",

To optimize algorithms, one might consider improving the processing algorithms and tree crown feature recognition techniques. For example, introducing a new raster data smoothing algorithm when generating canopy height models could enhance the accuracy of estimating tree structural parameters.",
