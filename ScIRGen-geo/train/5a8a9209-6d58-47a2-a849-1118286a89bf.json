                    "Answer": "Including original TIFF files in a dataset related to beetle species classification is significant because these high-quality images provide detailed visual information about the beetles. This includes images of the entire species, identification characteristics, distribution maps, and collection environment photos. Such detailed imagery is crucial for accurate taxonomic work, allowing researchers to examine fine morphological details and compare them with other specimens for classification and study of biodiversity.",

                    "Answer": "The 西藏毛唇蚁甲族专著图版数据集 includes original TIFF files of species identification features, distribution maps, and environmental collection images, which may differ from other datasets that could use varied file formats or focus on different aspects such as genetic data or acoustic recordings. This dataset provides detailed visual documentation, which is crucial for taxonomy, potentially offering higher accuracy and comprehensive morphological data compared to datasets that might prioritize other forms of data.",
