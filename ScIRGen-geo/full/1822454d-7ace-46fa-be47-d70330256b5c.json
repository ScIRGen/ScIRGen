            "description": "This dataset is based on the Vegetation Index (VI) derived from the MODIS land surface datasets MOD09CMG and MOD13C1, and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) data derived from MOD11C1. Using the VI-Ts triangle method, a global-scale daily air temperature dataset with a 0.05-degree resolution from 2001 to 2020 was retrieved. This air temperature dataset is an intermediate output variable from the Global Land Near Real-Time Evapotranspiration Dataset based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Standard Evapotranspiration Algorithm (VISEA) (Huang, L. (2023). Satellite-based Near-Real-Time Global Daily Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Estimates. National Tibetan Plateau / Third Pole Environment Data Center. https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.300782 . https://cstr.cn/18406.11.Terre.tpdc.300782.). It has been compared and evaluated with observational data from 149 FLUXCOM stations. The results indicate that the accuracy of this air temperature data is close to that of ground-based observations over most surfaces. However, in densely vegetated tropical rainforest areas (evergreen broadleaf forests), the accuracy is reduced due to the small variability in vegetation indices between grid cells and significant data gaps in MODIS land surface air temperature in these regions. The current data covers the period from 2001 to 2020, with data post-2020 to be updated gradually.",

It is particularly applied to create a daily air temperature dataset with a resolution of 0.05 degrees from 2001 to 2020. This method is part of the process used in generating a global land surface near-real-time evapotranspiration dataset, and its outputs have been compared with observational data from 149 FLUXCOM sites for evaluation.",
