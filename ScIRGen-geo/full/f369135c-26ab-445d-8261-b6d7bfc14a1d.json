            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) was obtained in the Biandukou foci experimental area from 11:20 to 12:30BJT on Mar. 19, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) the frost depth by the chopstick and the ruler. The soil was considered frozen when it was hard and with ice crystal. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office Word.\n     (2) the surface radiative temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer and the physical temperature by the thermocouple. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office Word.\n     (3) the soil moisture (soil samples from 0-1cm, 1-3cm and 3-5cm) by the microwave drying method. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office Word.\n     (4) photos of each sampling point in .jpg for further reference.\n     Six data files were included, the ground-based K-band microwave radiometer, the ground-based L-band microwave radiometer, the frost depth, soil moisture, the surface temperature and the surface conditions.",
