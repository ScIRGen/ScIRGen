            "description": "This data is the major and trace elements, zircon U-Pb, calcite C-O and sulfide S isotopic data of the whole pyroxene diorite in the Chishan gold deposit, Tongling ore concentration area, Anhui Province. The major element data were obtained by XRF, trace element data by ICP-MS, zircon U-Pb dating data by LA-ICP-MS, calcite C-O isotope by mat253 mass spectrometry, and S isotope data by ICP-MS δ VPlus gas isotope mass spectrometer. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can help to deepen the understanding of pyroxene diorite intrusions and associated gold deposits related to mineralization in Tongling area, and provide useful guidance for the prediction and prospecting of skarn type gold deposits in the future.",

                    "Answer": "XRF analysis, or X-ray fluorescence analysis, is a data collection method used to obtain whole-rock major element data. It involves exposing a sample to X-rays, which causes the elements within the sample to emit fluorescent X-rays of their own. This emission is characteristic of the specific elements present, allowing for their identification and quantification.",

                    "Answer": "Using XRF for major element analysis provides reliable quantitative data on the elemental composition of rocks, which is crucial for understanding the mineralogical and chemical characteristics of the pyroxene diorite. ICP-MS for trace element analysis offers high sensitivity and precision, enabling detailed insights into the trace element distribution. The combination of these methods enhances the accuracy of data, supporting more precise geological interpretations of the pyroxene diorite intrusions and their associated gold deposits in the Tongling area, which can aid in the prediction and exploration of skarn-type gold deposits.",
