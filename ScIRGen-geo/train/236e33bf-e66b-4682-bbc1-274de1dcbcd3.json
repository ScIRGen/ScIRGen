            "description": "Accurate and timely estimation of global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for drought monitoring, wildfire detection and water resource management. However, current satellite-based products unable to provide near-real-time (with a delay of up to one week) global-scale ET estimates. To address the limitation, we produced a near-real-time global daily ET dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.05° spanning from 2001 to the present using the Variation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Standard Evapotranspiration Algorithm (VISEA). The dataset is driven by shortwave radiation from European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ERA5-Land) and MODIS land products, e.g., surface reflectance (MOD09CMG), land surface temperature/emissivity (MOD11C1), land cover products (MCD12C1), vegetation indices (MOD13C1), and albedo (MCD43C3). We assess the accuracy of VISEA by comparing it against measurements at 150 flux towers, five independent global ET products and one precipitation from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) dataset. The results indicate that VISEA performs admirably, boasting a mean Correlation Coefficient of 0.4 and RMSE of 1.5 mm day-1 over 12 landcover types. Furthermore, the consistent spatial patterns of multi-year average VISEA ET align closely with GPCC precipitation data, reaffirming the dataset's ability to accurately represent global ET distribution. In this study, we present a global-scale, near-real-time, and highly accuracy daily ET estimation which can be incredibly useful for meteorology and hydrology applications. ",

The most widely applied method for converting the instantaneous satellite measurement to daily scale assumes that evaporative fraction (EF), defined as the ratio of ET to the available energy, is constant during the daytime. Today, evaporation is a critical component of the short-term numerical weather prediction, long-term climate simulations, and diagnoses of climate change. Products of actual evaporation are usually from ground measurements, climate (or hydrology) model output, or satellite-based estimates. Satellite measurements can calculate regional-scale evaporation at low-cost, and unlike the climate models, they have higher resolution and more realistic land parameters. Evapotranspiration for large basins or countries by remote sensing methods is calculated by extrapolating instantaneous remotely sensed satellite measurements over daily or more extended periods."

However, this method was proved to underestimate the daily ET. The original ET method calculated the daily evaporation more accurately than the other algorithms. However, the good fit was based on two compensating inaccuracies. Compared to the flux tower measurement, the original ET method underestimated the daily EF by 26% and overestimated the daily net radiation by 30%. Six of the seven proposed algorithms underpredicted the daily ET by 30-60%, mainly due to the inaccurate daily net radiation."

The daily mean air temperature Ta d (K) was calculated as the average of 8 3-hourly air temperature estimates (Figure G1). These 3-hourly air temperature estimates were interpolated by the instantaneous air temperature Ta iand the instantaneous night air temperature (which was assumed to be equal to the MODIS land surface temperature during the night) based on a sine-cosine fitting curve."
