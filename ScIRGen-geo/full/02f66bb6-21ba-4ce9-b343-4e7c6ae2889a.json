            "description": "The fluctuation of a single lake level is a comprehensive reflection of water balance within the basin, while the regional consistent fluctuations of lake level can indicate the change of regional effective moisture. Previous researches were mainly focused on reconstructing effective moisture by multiproxy analyses of lake sediments, but lacked the quantitative studies on regional effective moisture variation. This dataset exhibits the Holocene effective moisture change in typical lake regions of the Tibetan Plateau and East and Central Asia, including Qinghai Lake, Chen Co, Bangong Co, etc., by constructing a virtual lake system, based on a lake energy balance model, a lake water balance model and a transient climate evolution model. The simulation results provide a new perspective for exploring the evolution of lakes on the millennial scale.",

                    "Answer": "Quantitative methods using lake energy balance models, lake water balance models, and transient climate evolution models provide a continuous and quantitative view of Holocene effective moisture changes, using virtual lakes as carriers. In contrast, traditional sediment-based proxy analyses rely on multiple indicators within lake sediments to reconstruct past effective moisture, but often lack quantitative regional analysis. The simulation results offer a new perspective on lake evolution over millennial timescales, potentially providing more detailed quantitative insights than traditional methods.",

                    "Answer": "The consistency of lake level fluctuations across a region can reflect regional effective moisture changes by showing how multiple lakes respond to climatic and hydrological conditions. In this field, a dataset based on lake energy balance models, lake water balance models, and transient climate evolution models is utilized to simulate continuous and quantitative changes in effective moisture for lakes across the Tibetan Plateau and East-Central Asia. These simulations provide insights into how effective moisture has influenced lake evolution over millennia.",

This approach provides a new perspective on the millennial-scale evolution of lakes by integrating energy balance models, water balance models, and transient climate evolution models, which can improve the understanding of past environmental changes in these regions.",
