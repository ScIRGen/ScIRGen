            "description": "The dataset of object spectral was obtained in the Linze station foci experimental area from May 25 to Jul. 11, 2008. The measurement instrument is ASD Spectroradiometer (350～2 500 nm) from BNU and the reference board (40% before Jun. 15 and 20% hereafter). The selected typical objects included maize field, soil, soil with known moisture and desert scrub. The measured quadrates included Wulidun farmland quadrates (May 28 and 30, Jun. 16 and 29 and Jul. 11), the desert transit zone strips (May 28 and 30 and Jun. 16) and Linze station quadrates (May 23 and Jul. 9) Besides, soil samples were collected inside Linze station quadrates on Jun. 24 and 30, 2008. Raw spectral data were archived as binary files, which were recorded daily in detail, and pre-processed data on reflectance and transmittivity were archived as text files (.txt). \n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",

This involves capturing the spectral reflectance data of objects such as farmland, desert shrubs, and soils with known moisture content, across specific wavelength ranges (350-2500 nm). The observations are conducted at designated sample plots, and the data collected can be in the form of raw binary files or preprocessed reflectance data.",

                    "Answer": "A dataset involves measuring land surface features using an ASD spectrometer, covering wavelengths from 350 to 2,500 nm. The data collection occurs in different land cover types, including farmland, desert, and soil with known moisture content. Reference panels with 40% and 20% reflectivity are used to calibrate the spectrometer. The raw binary data from the spectrometer are processed using ViewSpecPro software to produce reflectance data in a text format. The collection is conducted on specific dates across different land cover types to capture the spectral characteristics accurately.",

Challenges in these terrains include managing different environmental conditions, which is addressed by using different reference panels—40% reference panels were used before June 15, switching to 20% thereafter. The data collection involves specific sample plots like the Wulidun farmland plot, desert transition zone, and sample plots within the Linze station. Spectral data of various land cover types, such as maize fields, soil with known water content, and desert shrubs, are collected, with data stored in both raw binary formats and preprocessed reflectance data as text.
