            "description": "Soil profiles in this dataset were surveyed in the western and central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in July 2019, including Ali, Xigaze and Naqu of the Tibet and Kashgar and Hotan of the Xinjiang. Information on the profile ID, longitude, latitude, soil types was provided. Soil types were referenced according to the Chinese Soil Taxonomy. The Chinese Soil Taxonomy is a hierarchical system, in which 6 categories were defined: Order, Suborder, Group, Subgroup, Family and Series. The sampling location was recorded by a handheld GPS receiver. Especially, these soil types were initially determined based on the diagnostic horizons and diagnostic properties identified in field. Due to the effect of epidemic, physicochemical properties of some soil samples have not been achieved and thus some soil types need to be updated in the following months.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of soil data collection on the Tibetan Plateau, 'soil type classification' refers to the categorization of soil samples based on their characteristics and properties as per the Chinese soil system classification standards. This involves observing soil profiles and surrounding landscapes during field sampling and assigning them to specific soil classes, subclasses, and types. The classification may require further refinement based on physicochemical property analysis to update or confirm the initial soil type assignments.",

                    "Answer": "The delay in analyzing the physical and chemical properties of soil samples can lead to initial inaccuracies in soil classification. This is because the soil types identified solely through field sampling and observation might not accurately capture the diagnostic layers that are determined through detailed laboratory analysis. Consequently, the soil classification may need to be updated once the physical and chemical properties are assessed, potentially affecting the reliability of the data for further research.",

                    "Answer": "The primary motivation for collecting soil type data in the central and western regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2019 is to provide a fundamental soil background dataset that describes the distribution of soil types in these areas. This dataset serves as a baseline for subsequent research and other projects by offering detailed information about soil types and their geographic coordinates, derived from field sampling and soil profile observations. The data collection aims to enhance understanding of soil distribution in these regions, which can be critical for ecological studies, land management, and environmental planning. Moreover, due to delays caused by the pandemic, there's an intention to update soil classifications based on further analysis of physical and chemical properties, indicating an ongoing effort to refine and improve the dataset for more accurate and comprehensive uses in future research.",

This delay might affect the accuracy of the initial soil type classification, as further diagnosis based on these properties could lead to revised soil type determinations.",
