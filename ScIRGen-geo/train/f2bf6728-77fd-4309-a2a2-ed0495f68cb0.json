                "Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important geophysical parameter that is essential for studying global climate change. SSTs are widely used in atmospheric and oceanographic studies, such as in atmospheric simulations, climate change monitoring, and studies of marine dynamic environments. A small variation in the ocean temperature exerts strong impacts on regional and even global climate change, energy exchange, and the environment due to the unique physical characteristics of the oceans, including their high heat capacity. It is difficult for traditional SST measurements based on buoys, platforms, and voluntary ships to obtain large-scale and synchronous SST data due to the large gaps present in the data over both space and time. Compared to the traditional in situ SST monitoring approach, remote sensing technology has advantages in terms of large-scale and dynamic monitoring and has been used to acquire global ocean SST observation data. Retrievals from satellite thermal infrared sensors can provide global SSTs at high temporal frequencies and spatial resolutions of typically 1–4 km with low uncertainty. However, the spatial resolutions of passive microwave sensors are very coarse and are greatly affected by land and sea surface wind and waves, which makes it impossible to obtain detailed information about SSTs. Therefore, the SST information obtained by a single satellite remote sensor is often incomplete and limited and cannot fully meet the user’s demand for a dataset with a high resolution, high precision, and full spatiotemporal coverage. Many SST fusion algorithms use multiple satellites and in situ data to take advantage of the strengths of each SST observation and solve the above issues; these algorithms include objective analysis (OA), optimal interpolation (OI), three-dimensional variational (3D-Var), and Kalman filtering (KF)."

Additionally, clouds render many thermal infrared readings invalid, and passive microwave sensors' low resolution further complicates data accuracy. These factors can limit the practical applications of SST datasets unless addressed through correction models and fusion algorithms that harmonize disparate data sources.",

This leads to a higher resolution, more accurate datasets that can better capture mesoscale ocean phenomena and support detailed analyses in climate change research, disaster prevention, and mitigation efforts. The improvements in accuracy, as demonstrated by a 0.65°C enhancement in reconstructed pixels, indicate a significant step towards achieving reliable datasets for comprehensive climate studies.",

A potential solution is the use of fusion algorithms, such as objective analysis, optimal interpolation, three-dimensional variational, and Kalman filtering, which leverage the strengths of multiple data sources to provide a high-resolution, high-precision dataset with full spatiotemporal coverage.
