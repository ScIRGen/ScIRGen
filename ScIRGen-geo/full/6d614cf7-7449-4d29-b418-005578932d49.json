This technique involves collecting data on the recommended values of Q and P under low-frequency conditions, the determination of major and trace elements in samples like ATHO-G at various laser frequencies, and the detection limits of element concentrations. It also includes analyzing the aerosol transport mode and mass spectrometer signal output, where data is processed using techniques like overlay integration homogenization algorithms to overcome data collection challenges associated with high-frequency laser experiments.",
