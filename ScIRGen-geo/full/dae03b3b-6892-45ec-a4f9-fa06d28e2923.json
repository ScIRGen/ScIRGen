            "description": "This data includes the benthos data of 21 lakes around Selinco and Namco in 2019. The sampling mainly uses bottom trawl in the littoral zone and Ekman collector in the deep-water area. After integrating the materials obtained by the two ways, the relative abundance of benthos data of each lake is given. The main benthos species are Gammarus, water beetles, and chironomid larvae. However, the frequency of Gastropoda and Ostracoda is low, which may be related to the sampling sites. The data further divided different types of benthos into 21 taxa, which improved the recognition accuracy and cognitive range and would provide a reference for the assessment of aquatic animal diversity and fishery resources in plateau lakes.",
            "instructions": "The file named STEP_2019_Lake benthos_relative abundance.xlsx, you can open it with Excel software.\nThe model of lake name + sampling date is used to name sampling points; Species names provide two corresponding patterns: Chinese name and Latin name; The benthic data is relative abundance.",

                    "Answer": "The relative abundance of specific benthic species like lake shrimp and midge larvae could indicate the ecological conditions and biodiversity in plateau lake environments. These species may reflect the health of the aquatic ecosystem, with their abundance suggesting suitable habitat conditions, water quality, and food availability. The presence of these species, along with low occurrences of snails and ostracods, might also provide insights into the sampling methods or environmental factors affecting species distribution.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating materials collected through bottom trawling and Ekman grab sampling methods allows for a comprehensive dataset that includes both nearshore and deep-water benthic communities. This approach can improve data accuracy and provide a more complete picture of biodiversity by capturing a wider range of species. However, the frequency of occurrence for certain taxa, like snails and ostracods, may be underrepresented due to sampling point settings, highlighting the importance of careful site selection and method combination to ensure balanced representation.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of assessing benthic fauna in lakes, materials are collected using bottom trawl nets along the coastal zones and Ekman collectors in deep water areas. These materials are then integrated to provide data on the relative abundance of benthic fauna across different lakes. The main benthic species identified include lake amphipods, water beetles, and chironomid larvae, with lower frequencies of snails and ostracods, potentially influenced by the sampling site setup.",
