It mainly reflects the geographical distribution, area size, and mobility of sand dunes in China. According to the system design requirements and relevant standards, the input data is standardized and uniformly converted into a standard format for various types of data input. Build a library to run the delivery system.\nThis project uses the TM image in 2000 as the information source, and interprets, extracts, and edits the coverage of the national land use map and TM digital image information in 2000. It uses remote sensing and geographic information system technology to 1: 100,000 Thematic mapping requirements for scale bar maps were made on the desert, sandy land and gravel Gobi in China. The 1: 100,000 desert map across the country can save users a lot of data entry and editing work when they are engaged in research on resources and the environment. Digital maps can be easily converted into layout maps\nThe dataset properties are as follows:\nDivided into two folders e00 and shp:\nDesert map name and province comparison table in each folder\n01 Ahsm Anhui\n02 Bjsm Beijing\n03 Fjsm Fujian\n04 Gdsm Guangdong\n05 Gssm Gansu\n06 Gxsm Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region\n07 Gzsm Guizhou\n08 Hebsm Hebei\n09 Hensm Henan\n10 Hljsm Heilongjiang\n11 Hndsm Hainan\n12 Hubsm Hubei\n13 Jlsm Jilin Province\n14 Jssm Jiangsu\n15 Jxsm Jiangxi\n16 Lnsm Liaoning\n17 Nmsm Inner Mongolia Gu Autonomous Region\n18 Nxsm Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region\n19 Qhsm Qinghai\n20 Scsm Sichuan\n21 Sdsm Shandong\n22 Sxsm Shaanxi Province\n23 Tjsm Tianjin\n24 Twsm Taiwan Province\n25 Xjsm Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n26 Xzsm Tibet Autonomous Region\n27 Zjsm Zhejiang\n28 Shxsm Shanxi\n1.

                "Field surveys of vegetation in large desert areas are very challenging, while the development of remote sensing technology provides a powerful means to extract surface vegetation conditions from multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing information, making large-scale monitoring of surface vegetation possible. The Vegetation Index (VI) method is a commonly used economical and effective approach to obtain large-scale vegetation information from remote sensing images. It utilizes different combinations of red and infrared bands, which contain over 90% of vegetation information, from on-orbit satellites to conduct vegetation research. In arid and semi-arid regions, vegetation is sparse and has low coverage, and the surface is highly heterogeneous. By analyzing different VIs, it has been found that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has the strongest ability to detect low coverage vegetation and can effectively monitor changes in desert vegetation. NOAA/AVHRR is one of the longest time series satellite Earth observation datasets to date, making NOAA/AVHRR NDVI the most important data for analyzing vegetation parameters at a regional scale. The Gurbantünggüt Desert, covering approximately 48,800 square kilometers, is the second largest desert in China, after the Taklamakan Desert. Unlike other mobile deserts, its unique geographical environment and climatic conditions allow a large amount of desert vegetation to survive, with vegetation coverage on dune surfaces reaching 15% to 50%. At the same time, the Gurbantünggüt Desert is also located in a key area affected by dust storms originating from the northwest, and its vegetation condition directly relates to surface stability, playing a role in either weakening or strengthening the occurrence of dust storms."

The NDVI data is calculated using the following formula: NDVI = (CH2 - CH1) / (CH2 + CH1). First, the boundary vector file of the Gurbantünggüt Desert was converted to the same projection as the NDVI data using ArcMap software. Then, the boundary vector file was converted to IMG format using ERDAS software (in batch processing mode). Next, the Mask function in ERDAS was used to extract the NDVI data of the Gurbantünggüt Desert from the Eurasian continent dataset, and it was converted to a geographic projection with a resolution of 0.1 degrees. Finally, the IMG format file was exported as binary grid data, and a program written in IDL was used to perform statistical calculations on 552 scenes of NDVI data. To more effectively eliminate the adverse effects of cloud cover, atmospheric influences, and geometric relationships during observations, the MVC processing (Equation 2) was applied to the ten-day NDVI data of the study area to obtain the monthly maximum NDVI."

The data on dust storm and blowing sand days comes from the Xinjiang Meteorological Bureau Information Center, which mainly includes the number of dust storms and blowing sand weather events (combined) for each month and year. Since blowing sand days are not counted when dust storms occur, the dust day count defined in this paper is the sum of blowing sand and dust storm days, covering the time series from 1981 to 2003."

                "The results indicate that over the past 23 years, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of the Gurbantünggüt Desert has shown an overall increasing trend. The monthly average NDVI gradually increases starting in April, reaching its maximum between June and August, and dropping to its lowest in December to February. Spatially, areas with high NDVI values are concentrated in the central and western parts of the desert, specifically in the central region of the Dezuosoteng Airison Desert and the Sobugul Bulei Desert, which are also the areas where NDVI has significantly increased over the past 23 years. An analysis of the correlation between NDVI in the Gurbantünggüt Desert and sandstorm events during the same period reveals a clear negative correlation between NDVI and sandstorm occurrences, with this negative correlation being more pronounced in the summer. This indicates that in the Gurbantünggüt Desert, there exists a negative coupling relationship between vegetation conditions and sandstorm events, suggesting that vegetation is one of the factors influencing the occurrence and intensity of sandstorms."
