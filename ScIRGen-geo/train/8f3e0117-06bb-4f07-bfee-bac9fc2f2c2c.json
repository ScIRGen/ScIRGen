            "description": "The multiscale reflectance spectra measurements mainly refer to the spectra measurements of leaf and canopy of different vegetation cover surfaces. The measurements were carried out over the main forests and crops of different areas in China. The croplands’ spectra were sampled from homogenous large-area-covered quadrates. For the forest canopy measuring, the field measurement was assisted by a tower or UVA. ASD or SVC was used to measure the spectra at the ground or from the tower. While for UVA, the hyperspectral imager was mounted to measure canopy spectra. The majority of measurements were conducted in the growing season (from July to October) of 2017 and 2018. The spectral distribution of each specific target is estimated as the average of replicated measurements. In order to collect smooth and continuous spectral curves, the least squares polynomial fitting algorithm is applied to remove the abnormal fluctuations in the vapor absorption channel, and the spectral curves are interpolated to 1 nm spectral resolution using piecewise linear interpolation functions. This dataset aids particularly the development of the modeling of vegetation, especially support further research on cross-scale ecological processes and underlying mechanisms and physical radiative transfer processes, and also the retrieval of surface biophysical and biochemical parameters. Moreover, they can serve as a reference truth for satellite observations in validation.",
            "instructions": "The leaf-canopy-Landsat-MODIS spectra data matched in time and space were organized in a folder named as “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS”. The “AAAA” was set as “spec”,the “BBBB_CCCC” the land cover and the object name and the “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS” the measured time. The core files of the full-spectrum include the combination data of reflectance, emissivity, microwave bright temperature, metadata files, and the satellite data. The data file was processed as TXT format and the metadata file was set as XML format. The satellite data and the quick view image was set as Tiff and JPEG format, respectively. As for the name of each spectral data, the file name was recorded as “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_XXXX”, where the “XXXX” shows the file type, “A000” means the data file, and “B000” means the auxiliary file of XML. The “AAAA” represents the spectral types, where “refl” denotes the reflectance. And the “pixel”, “img”, and “view” represent the satellite pixel spectral, the satellite image, and the quick-view image, respectively. Regarding the name of the metadata, “AAAA” was set as “comp” and “pixel” . “comp” refers to the general scene information of the spectrum，and “pixel” indicates the information of satellite pixel spectrum. For the leaf and canopy reflectance spectra, \"BBBB\" was set to \"compo\" and \"canopy\", respectively.",

This involves using different platforms like cranes and UAVs for forest canopies and sampling from uniformly covered plots for agricultural fields. Instruments like ASD or SVC spectrometers are used for ground or tower measurements, while hyperspectral imagers are installed on UAVs for canopy measurements.",

                    "Answer": "Variability in spectral measurements can be caused by differences in vegetation coverage, seasonal changes, and environmental conditions across different regions in China. The use of different measurement platforms, such as ground-based ASD or SVC sensors and UAV-mounted hyperspectral imagers, can also introduce variability. Additionally, atmospheric conditions, such as water vapor, can affect spectral data, but these effects are minimized using polynomial fitting and linear interpolation to achieve smooth spectral curves.",

These methods, by capturing detailed spectral data using ASD or SVC instruments and hyperspectral imaging from UAVs, allow for precise observations of spectral variations across different vegetation types and regions. The application of least squares polynomial fitting to remove atmospheric water vapor anomalies and interpolation to fine spectral resolution further refines the data, which can enhance the modeling of physiological and biochemical parameters and support cross-scale ecological process studies. Additionally, these methods provide a relative 'true value' for validation purposes, potentially increasing the reliability of vegetation models.",

For preprocessing, a least-squares polynomial fitting algorithm is applied to remove atmospheric water vapor-induced fluctuations, and a piecewise linear interpolation function is used to interpolate spectral curves to a 1nm spectral resolution for smoothness and continuity.
