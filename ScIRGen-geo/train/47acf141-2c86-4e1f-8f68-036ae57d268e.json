            "description": "This dataset was derived from long-term daily snow depth in China based on the boundary of the three-river-source area. The snow depth ranges from 0 to 100 cm, and the temporal coverage is from January 1 1980 to December 31 2020. The spatial and temporal resolutions are 0.25o and daily, respectively. Snow depth was produced from satellite passive microwave remote sensing data which came from three different sensors that are SMMR, SSM/I and SSMI/S. Considering the systematic bias among these sensors, the inter-sensor calibrations were performed to obtain temporal consistent passive microwave remote sensing data. And the long-term daily snow depth in China were produced from this consistent data based on the spectral gradient method.For header file information, refer to the data set header.txt.",

This approach utilizes data from three different passive microwave sensors: SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMI/S, and involves cross-correction for systematic biases between sensors. Other remote sensing techniques might offer different resolutions and may not require such cross-correction processes, depending on the specific sensors and methodologies employed.",

By addressing the systematic biases among different sensors like SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMI/S, the cross-calibration process ensures consistency in the data, resulting in a more robust and comprehensive dataset that accurately reflects snow depth over time. This enhances the dataset's value for tracking changes and trends in snow depth across large spatial and temporal scales.",

This involves using data from different passive microwave sensors (SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMI/S) to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy, addressing sensor biases through cross-correction and leveraging the passive microwave brightness temperature gradient method to produce the dataset.
