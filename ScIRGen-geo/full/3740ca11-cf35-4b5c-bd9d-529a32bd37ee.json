            "description": "The Maduo Xiang (Maduo Village) permafrost wetland profile (35°02′24″ N, 96°15′36″ E, 4490 m) was located on a south slope, ca. 10 km from Maduo Xiang (Maduo Village), in the northwestern HAYR in the north of Bayan Har Mountains. Geochemical element content were carried out using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Magix PW2403, the Netherlands), with an estimated error of less than 0.3% for geochemical elements. Reconstructions of the Holocene (especially the mid-Holocene) climatic and environmental changes may serve as an analogue for future scenarios.",

This dataset is used to indicate changes in soil chemical weathering processes over time, which can further reflect regional climate changes since approximately 7000 years before present (B.P.). Such a dataset is typically derived from soil core samples and analyzed using techniques like X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to measure element concentrations with a specified error margin.",
