            "description": "The daily cloudless MODIS Snow area ratio data set (2000-2015) of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is based on MODIS daily snow product - mod10a1, which is obtained by using a cloud removal algorithm based on cubic spline interpolation.\nThe data set is projected by UTM with spatial resolution of 500m, providing daily snow cover FSC results in the Tibetan Plateau. The data set is a day-to-day document, from 24 February 2000 to 31 December 2015. Each file is the result of snow area proportion on that day, the value is 0-100%, which is envi standard file, the naming rule is: yyyddd_fsc_0.5km.img, where yyyy represents the year, DDD represents Julian day (001-365 / 366). Files can be opened and viewed directly with envi or ArcMap.\nThe original MODIS Snow data product for cloud removal comes from the mod10a1 product processed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). This data set is in the format of HDF and uses the sinusional projection.\nThe attributes of the daily cloudless MODIS Snow area ratio data set (2000-2015) on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau consist of the spatial-temporal resolution, projection information and data format of the data set.\nTemporal and spatial resolution: the temporal resolution is day by day, the spatial resolution is 500m, the longitude range is 72.8 ° ~ 106.3 ° e, and the latitude is 25.0 ° ~ 40.9 ° n.\nProjection information: UTM projection.\nData format: envi standard format. File naming rules: \"yyyyddd\" + \". Img\", where yyyy stands for year, DDD stands for Julian day (001-365 / 366), and \". Img\" is the file suffix added for easy viewing in ArcMap and other software. For example, 2000055 ﹐ FSC ﹐ 0.5km.img represents the result on the 55th day of 2000.

                "Snow cover, as an important component of land cover, is one of the natural materials on the Earth’s surface with wide distribution, obvious seasonal variation, and high sensitivity to climate change. Snow plays an important role in the global energy and water cycles because of its high albedo and thermal and water storage properties, and can indicate the changes in global climate. Studying snow cover variation is of great importance in monitoring and maintaining water management for ecosystem processes and irrigation practices. In arid and semi-arid regions of Western China, snow cover is a very important water resource, since water from melted snow forms the headwaters for several of the largest rivers in Asia. Consequently, snow can also largely influence agriculture and animal husbandry. More importantly, more than one sixth of the global population relies on water from mountainous snowmelt. The Tianshan Mountains, as the water tower of Central Asia, are the source of major rivers in Central Asia. Snow cover in Tianshan Mountains, is an important predictor of regional climate change, as well as a crucial water source for its surrounding arid regions, and greatly influences the hydrological and biological processes. However, due to the scarcity and limitation of meteorological station, the in-situ snow cover observations are difficult to adequately quantify the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover in the mountainous regions. Recent technological advances in satellite remote sensing have allowed remote sensing data to extract the information of snow cover in the inaccessible areas with rugged terrain and hostile climate. The most recent and advanced remote sensing snow cover product is produced by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flown on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua platforms. Evaluation studies have suggested a high accuracy of MODIS snow cover products under clear skies, when comparing with the in-situ observations and other higher resolution satellite data at both regional and global scales. However, the extensive cloud obscuration in MODIS snow cover products greatly limits their applications. The spatiotemporal variation of the snow cover is affected substantially by both the temperature and precipitation. As one of the most sensitive and prominent areas responding to global climate changes, the temperature of the Tianshan Mountains in Central Asia has increased more than twice the rate of global warming in the past decades. The state of high variability in temperature of the Tianshan Mountains has led to changes in mountainous hydrological processes and water resources, and increased the runoff in the Tianshan Mountains due to the accelerated glacier/snowmelt."

The specific aims are to examine the snow cover variations in the Tianshan Mountains during the state of high variability in temperature of the Tianshan Mountains since 1998 and to address the possible cause for the snow cover changes from the perspective of climate factors."

Based on this cloud removal method, the daily cloud-free MODIS FSC datasets in Tianshan Mountains from 2001 to 2015 are produced.

Pearson correlation analysis is used to investigate the correlations between snow cover (SCA or SCD), and temperature and precipitation dynamics for the 15 years (2001–2015)."
