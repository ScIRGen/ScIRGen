            "description": "The data set is extracted from the NDVI data of long time series acquired by VEGETATION sensor on SPOT satellite. The time range of the data set is from May 1998 to 2013. In order to remove the noise in NDVI data, the maximum synthesis is carried out. A NDVI image is synthesized every 10 days. The data set is cut out from the global data set, so as to carry out the research and analysis of the source areas of the three rivers separately.\nThe data format of this data set is geotiff, spatial resolution is 1 km, temporal resolution is 10 days, time range: May 1998 to December 2013.",

                    "Answer": "NDVI, or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, is a numerical indicator that uses remote sensing measurements to assess whether a target area contains live green vegetation. In the context of vegetation monitoring using satellite data, NDVI is used to analyze the presence and condition of vegetation over time by utilizing the reflectance of near-infrared and visible light captured by satellite sensors. It is particularly useful in tracking changes in vegetation health, biomass, and coverage across large geographic areas over extended periods.",

                    "Answer": "The noise reduction technique used involves maximizing composite synthesis every 10 days to minimize noise in NDVI data. This approach focuses on selecting the highest NDVI values over a period to ensure that cloud cover and other atmospheric conditions do not reduce data quality. This can be compared to other methods like temporal filtering or machine learning algorithms used in different remote sensing datasets for noise reduction.",
