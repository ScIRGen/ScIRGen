      "description": "The data set contains the vortex correlator observation data of sidaqiao superstation in the downstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.The station is located in the fourth bridge of ejin banner in Inner Mongolia, tamarisk is the underlying surface.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 101.1374e, 42.0012n, and the altitude is 873 m.The height of the vortex correlation instrument is 8m, the sampling frequency is 10Hz, the ultrasonic direction is due to the north, and the distance between the ultrasonic wind speed and temperature instrument (CSAT3) and the CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500A, Li7500 after April 25) is 15cm.\nThe original observation data of vorticity correlativity is 10Hz, and the released data is the data of 30 minutes processed by Eddypro software. The main steps of its processing include: outfield value elimination, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output by Eddypro software was also screened.(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation were excluded;(3) the missing rate of 10Hz original data is more than 10% every 30min;(4) the observed data of weak turbulence at night were excluded (u* less than 0.1m/s).The average period of observation data was 30 minutes, 48 data a day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.From April 22 to 25, data was missing due to the calibration of Li7500 of vortex system.Suspicious data caused by instrument drift shall be identified in red.\nObservations published include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (℃), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), Mr. Hoff length L (m), sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE,Carbon dioxide flux mass identification QA_Fc.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest are 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Li et al.

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
        "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
        "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities.

However, because of the spatial heterogeneity at the sub-pixel scale, the in situ measurements over heterogeneous land surfaces only approximate the “ground-truth” ET data at the satellite pixel scale (1–10 km for medium-low spatial resolutions) and can introduce errors in the validation results."

The sensible heat flux (LAS-H) was obtained via an iteration method that combines the meteorological data (e.g., wind speed, air temperature, and air pressure) based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Only daytime (10:30–18:00 BST, Beijing standard time) data under unstable conditions were used to acquire the 30-min ET data at the MODIS pixel scale. The automatic weather station (AWS) data were processed to a 30-min average period, and data beyond the range of physical possibility were rejected. The LST data were calculated from downward and upward longwave radiation measured by the AWSs and the surface emissivity measured by the FT-IR spectrometer (102F). The spatial distributions of available energy, air temperature, wind speed, and air pressure from the 21 AWSs in the large experimental area were interpolated to a resolution of 90 m using the inverse distance-weighted method. The flux contributing source area of the EC and LAS measurements can be estimated using the footprint model, and the spatial representative area of the flux can be obtained quantitatively.
