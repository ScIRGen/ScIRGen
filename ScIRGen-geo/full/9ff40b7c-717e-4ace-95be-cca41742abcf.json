            "description": "In 2017, sulfide single mineral and cuprous oxide were heated in vacuum for oxidation reaction to generate sulfur dioxide, and then the sulfur isotope composition was analyzed by Finnigan mat-251 gas isotope mass spectrometer made in Germany. The accuracy of 34S measurement was good, and the relative error was 0 ± 2 ‰, the relative standard is v-cdt.\nThe samples were ultrasonically cleaned with milli-q water before dissolution. After drying, weigh about 50 mg of the sample and completely dissolve it in 1:1 HNO3 + HCl mixed acid. Then evaporate the sample to dryness, add 0.2 ml 2n HBr three times, and evaporate the sample to dryness respectively. After that, it was dissolved again in the mixed acid of HRB + HNO3 and passed through 50 ℃ twice μ The separation and purification of lead were carried out by ag1x8 (200-400 mesh) anion exchange resin. Then, the sample, together with silica gel and phosphoric acid, was put on the re single band (gerstenberger and HAase, 1997). The analytical accuracy of the instrument is 0.2% for 206Pb / 204Pb, 0.2% for 207Pb / 204Pb and 0.5% for 208Pb / 204Pb. The standard value of standard sample is 206Pb / 204Pb = 16.937 ± 0.002 (2 σ)， 207Pb/204Pb=15.457 ± 0.002 (2 σ) And 208Pb / 204Pb = 36.611 ± 0.004 (2 σ)( Todt et al., 1996).\nThe traditional BrF5 method (Clayton and mayeda, 1963) was used for oxygen isotope analysis of quartz. Mineral oxygen was extracted by BrF5 reacting with oxygen-containing minerals in vacuum and high temperature, and then converted into CO2 gas by BrF5 reacting with graphite rod at 700 ℃ ± 2 ‰, the relative standard is v-small. H isotope analysis of fluid inclusions in quartz is performed by Zn decomposition method. Pure quartz samples of 40 – 60 mesh were degassed in vacuum at 150 ℃ for more than 4 hours to completely remove the surface adsorbed water and secondary inclusion water, and then burst to take water at 400 ℃ and react with zinc to form H2. The analysis accuracy was 0 ± 2 ‰, the relative standard is v-small.",
