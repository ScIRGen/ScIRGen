            "description": "We developed a 1-km resolution global carbon fluxes dataset derived through deep learning trained with in-situ measurements of 280 stations, named as GCFD (Global carbon fluxes dataset, Xiong et al, 2022). GCFD provides three carbon flux variables including gross primary production (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (RECO) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at 10-day resolution over the period from January1999 to June 2020. Convolutional Neural Network is used to predict carbon fluxes using fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, leaf area index, 2 m temperature, solar shortwave radiation downward, latent heat, sensible heat, soil temperature and soil moisture as covariates. Using in-situ carbon fluxes as the benchmark, two independent experiments are conducted to investigate the estimation accuracy of the GCFD: station-to-station experiment (RMSE ranges from 1.580-1.772 gC m-2 d-1 and R ranges from 0.54-0.78) and year-to-year experiment (RMSE ranges from 2.174-2.270 gC m-2 d-1 and R ranges from 0.20-0.66). As GCFD is based on in-situ data, it can be useful complements of existing model-based and satellite-based data sets for various meteorological and ecological analyses and modeling, especially for those applications requiring high resolution carbon flux maps. We provided two versions with different resolution, i.e., 30 arc seconds (~1km) and 0.1 degree (~9km).",
