            "description": "This dataset includes dating data, stone tool data and paleoenvironment data of JJF01 Paleolithic site in northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The Paleolithic archaeological record of the Tibetan Plateau is crucial for understanding human ecological and genetic adaptation to life in high altitudes. Recent work on the Tibetan Plateau has documented hominin occupations by Denisovans at Baishiya Karst Cave (BKC) from at least ca. 160, and again around 100 and 60 thousand years ago (ka), followed by modern human occupation at Nwya Devu (ND) around 30-40 ka. However, with the exception of these two geographically distinct sites, there are very few Paleolithic sites with secure stratigraphy and reliable dates on the Tibetan Plateau. Thus, the spatial and temporal history of Paleolithic hominin occupation of the Tibetan Plateau remains poorly understood. Here we report a newly discovered well-stratified and well-dated Paleolithic site, Jiangjunfu 01 (JJF01), from the northeastern margin of the plateau. Optical dating of sediments from cultural layers shows that the site was occupied by hominin who employed simple core-and-flake technology, during warmer\ninterglacial environments ~90e120 ka. To date, JJF01 is one of the three oldest archaeological sites with secure stratigraphy and reliable dating from the Tibetan Plateau, further confirming that hominins, potentially Denisovans, occupied and inhabited the highest region of our planet at least by the early Upper Pleistocene.",

It helps establish a timeline for human occupation by measuring the last time sediment grains were exposed to light, providing insights into when ancient humans, such as Denisovans, inhabited high-altitude areas during warm interglacial periods.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for dating and environmental analysis at Paleolithic sites in the Northeast Tibetan Plateau, such as the use of optical dating for cultural layer sediments, focus on understanding human adaptation to high altitudes. In other high-altitude regions, similar methods may be employed, but the specific challenges and environmental conditions may lead to variations in approach. The unique ecological and genetic adaptations of humans in the Tibetan Plateau, such as the potential presence of Denisovans at sites, might not be as prominent in other regions, influencing the emphasis and techniques in data collection.",

It can lead to better understanding of human adaptation to extreme environments, and provide insights into the presence and activities of ancient human species, such as Denisovans, during interglacial periods.",
