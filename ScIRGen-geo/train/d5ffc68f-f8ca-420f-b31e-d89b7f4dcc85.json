            "description": "The data set of supply of agricultural water resources in Central Asian adopts the water balance method to calculate the precipitation and runoff depth on grid scale in five central Asian countries, respectively, and estimate the agricultural water resources supply in five central Asian countries. The data source is mainly the precipitation and runoff data products of NOAH model in GLDAS. Each original raster data of 0.25 ° is resampled, starting from the upper-left corner of the original grid, and extending to the adjacent right and lower grids in turn, and every four grids (0.5 °) are merged into one grid, taking the median data as the center point value corresponding to four grid of geographic coordinates. The extreme values of the grids could be eliminated. The data sets includes three time periods of 2000s (2001-2005), 2010s (2006-2010) and 2015s (2011-2015) with a spatial resolution of 0.5°*0.5°; The data of demand of agricultural water resources in Central Asia include irrigation water requirement of cotton and winter wheat in 2006, 2010 and 2016 over Central Asia. This was calculated by the equation of  irrigation water requirement  presented by FAO. It is expected to provide basic data support for distributed water cycle simulation, water supply and demand, development and utilization analysis in five central Asian countries.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using precipitation and runoff data products from the GLDAS NOAH model to estimate the agricultural water supply. The original grid data at a 0.25° resolution is compared and then aggregated by calculating the median value of four adjacent grids (forming a 0.5° grid) to mitigate extreme values. This median value represents the geographic coordinate's value at the center of the four grids, providing an estimate of the water supply for the region across specified time periods.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for estimating agricultural water supply in Central Asia using GLDAS data involve calculating precipitation and runoff depth at a grid scale and using the NOAH model's precipitation and runoff data products. These methods differ from traditional hydrological measurement techniques that might involve direct in-situ measurements of precipitation and runoff, which can provide localized data but may lack the broader spatial coverage and model-based consistency of GLDAS. The GLDAS approach allows for comprehensive spatial coverage with a consistent modeling framework across different time periods, while traditional methods may offer higher accuracy in specific locations but are limited in scope.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in the accuracy of agricultural water supply estimations can be attributed to the spatial resolution of the data and the methods used to process it. The data collection method involves using the GLDAS NOAH model's precipitation and runoff data products. To improve accuracy, the original 0.25° grid data is compared and processed by taking the median value of four neighboring grids (0.5°) to reduce the impact of extreme values. This methodological approach can lead to variations in accuracy across different time periods and regions due to differences in precipitation, runoff patterns, and grid data processing.",

                    "Answer": "The use of a median-based grid merging technique helps in eliminating extreme values across grid cells by combining four 0.25° grids into a single 0.5° grid, where the median is taken as the representative value. This approach reduces the influence of outliers and extreme values, which could otherwise skew the data and lead to inaccurate estimation of agricultural water supply. Consequently, the technique provides more stable and reliable data for analysis across different time periods, namely 2000s, 2010s, and 2015s.",
