            "description": "Water scarcity，food crises and ecological deterioration caused by drought disasters are a direct threat to food security and socio-economic development. Improvement of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management is now urgently required. This article describes major scientific and technological progress in the field of drought disaster risk assessment. Drought is a worldwide natural disaster that has long affected agricultural production as well as social and economic activities. Frequent droughts have been observed in the Belt and Road area, in which much of the agricultural land is concentrated in fragile ecological environment. The relative humidity index is the difference between the amount of precipitation in a certain period of time and the potential evapotranspiration over the same period divided by the potential evapotranspiration.",

                    "Answer": "The relative humidity index, calculated as the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration divided by potential evapotranspiration over a certain period, assists in assessing drought risk, which is critical for national food security and socio-economic development.",

                    "Answer": "When expanding datasets related to relative humidity indexes for more effective drought monitoring, considerations should include the temporal and spatial variability of droughts, the integration of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data, and the importance of capturing the spatiotemporal changes in drought conditions. This approach would improve understanding of drought patterns and their effect on agricultural areas, especially under the influence of global warming.",
