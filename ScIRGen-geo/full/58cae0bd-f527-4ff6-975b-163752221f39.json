            "description": "This dataset includes monthly evaporation (soil evaporation, vegetation transpiration and canopy interception) on the Tibetan Plateau from 1979 to 2018, with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees. The dataset is based on the ERA5 net radiation and China meteorological forcing dataset (CMFD). The evaporation is derived by the sigmoid generalized complementary equation, which is calibrated and verified by the observation data of 12 eddy flux sites and water balance data of 7 river basins (the source region of Yangtze river, the source region of Yellow River, the Nu River, the Yarlung Zangbo River, the Hei River, Qiangtang, and Qaidam) on the Tibetan Plateau, which shows a high accuracy. The data set can be used to study the hydrology, water resources and climate change in the Tibetan Plateau.",
