The traditional point measurements can just provide a soil moisture distribution in a limited area. The hydrologic models can simulate the soil moisture variation in large spatial and temporal scales. However, the uncertainty in initial model state, model physical parameters, meteorological forcing variables and model equations brings much error in the soil moisture estimation. Many researchers suggested that the most promising approach for estimating soil moisture is the integration of remote sensing surface soil moisture data and a hydrologic model (Kostove and Jackson, 1993). Many researches have been carried out on optimizing a computational model through minimizing the difference between the observation and model simulation results by the re-parameterization (Jarlan et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2009) or re-initialization (Heathman et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2008) of the computational model separately. The re-parameterization approach can improve the model state variables by adjusting uncertain parameters. Since some parameters can hardly be obtained by field measurements, they are often estimated from the experiences or references, which brings much uncertainty to the model parameters. The re-initialization approach does not attribute the simulation errors to the uncertainties of the initial conditions, model parameters or model physical equations. It can adjust the state variables directly and it adopts the updated state variables as the initial field to re-initialize the model. The most effective and popular re-initialization approach is Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)."

The DHSVM was coupled with a semi-empirical backscattering model (Oh) to simulate backscattering coefficients. When the ASAR data were available, a cost function was set up based on the gap between the backscattering coefficients from ASAR observation and the backscattering coefficients from the simulations. Then the EnKF was used to optimize the state variables. If the cost function was higher than twice the ASAR observation noises, the simulation was treated as unacceptable. Then the cost function was minimized by the GA approach. The sensitive parameters of the DHSVM were re-parameterized. The simulations were divided into acceptable and unacceptable cases. The EnKF and GA were used to re-initialize and re-parameterize the simulation process. The assimilation experiment was carried out in the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China."
