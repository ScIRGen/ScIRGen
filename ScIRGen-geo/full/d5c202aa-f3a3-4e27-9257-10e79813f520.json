            "description": "We produce a new lake area change dataset at monthly sampling over 2015−2020 from 16,801 satellite images. Our estimates achieve an accuracy of < 30 m, as evidenced by in-situ GPS field survey validations of representative lake shorelines. The newly-discovered accelerations of lake area changes over 2015–2020 reveal obvious contrasting regional patterns. The largest increasing acceleration of lake area changes was 5.6±0.8 km²/yr² for Selin Co in the southern inner plateau, whereas the largest decreasing one was -6.0±0.7 km²/yr² for Maergai Chaka in the northern inner plateau. By investigating the acceleration of lake area changes over 2015−2020, we identified a statistically significant contrasting regional pattern in the inner TP. This indicates that, although most lakes are expanding, those in the northern inner TP were experiencing a significant deacceleration of lake area changes, whereas an accelerating pattern can be observed for lakes in the southern inner TP.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) serves as an excellent natural laboratory for investigating the response of lakes to the ongoing climate change, as there is limited impact from anthropogenic activities due to sparse populations. Even though global lakes show an overall decreasing trend in lake area, the lake areas on the TP have predominantly experienced an obvious expansion over recent decades, observed by optical remote sensing data collected by Landsat series and Sentinel-2 satellite. However, due to strong and frequent cloud contamination on optical images, previous studies have usually used data collected over the less cloudy winters, therefore limiting their investigations of lake area changes at annual, multi-year, or longer intervals. Consequently, lake area changes at shorter temporal intervals (e.g., sub-annual and monthly), which are crucial, more sensitive, and previously much less studied indicators of the lakes’ response to natural climate variability, remain poorly understood."

When processing the optical images, we used our in-house Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture LaeNet. Therefore, we used CloudNet to process the SAR images obtained in the summer months. In short, we use deep learning (i.e., the CloudNet and LaeNet) to extract the water- and non-water bodies in the buffer zone from the SAR and optical satellite images, and then take boundaries of water- and non-water bodies as the lake shorelines."

Lakes are found to store only a small portion (< 5 %) of net precipitation in summer, increased to ~11 % for years with heavy precipitation, which helps understand the water mass budget for lakes over there."

                    "Answer": "Investigating lake area changes at shorter temporal intervals like monthly is essential because these intervals provide more sensitive and precise indicators of lakes' responses to natural climate variability. Monthly data allow for a better understanding of the immediate impacts of climate events, such as heavy rainfall, and enable the analysis of rapid oscillations in atmospheric circulation that are not captured by longer temporal intervals.",

                    "Answer": "In this domain, deep learning techniques are employed by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as LaeNet and CloudNet. The process involves extracting water- and non-water bodies from SAR and optical images, with the boundaries of these bodies considered as lake shorelines. The methodology includes processing optical images with LaeNet and SAR images with CloudNet, especially during summer months when SAR images are less affected by snow and ice.",

This challenge is addressed by improving the performance of image processing techniques, even when SAR and optical images are collected in different months, to better delineate the shorelines.",

                    "Answer": "A significant challenge with SAR images for winter shoreline delineation is the similarity between frozen lake surfaces and surrounding ice/snow-covered land, which makes distinction difficult. This challenge is addressed by integrating SAR images with optical images, even if collected in different months, and by using deep learning models to enhance the accuracy of shoreline extraction.",

By using SAR images in conjunction with optical images, researchers can achieve a high temporal resolution of lake area changes, overcoming limitations of solely relying on optical data.",
