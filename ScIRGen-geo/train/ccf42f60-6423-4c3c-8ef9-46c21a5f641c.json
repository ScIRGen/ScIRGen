The data has a spatial resolution of 30m and a temporal resolution of one year. It is derived from the Global Artificial Impervious Area (GAIA) change data extracted from Landsat images from 1985 to 2018 (Gong Peng et al.). The researchers evaluated 7 sets of data every 5 years from 1985 to 2015. The average overall accuracy is over 90%, and it is the only urban construction land dataset spanning 30 years.",

Artiﬁcial impervious areas are mainly man-made structures that are composed of any material that impedes or prevents natural inﬁltration of water into the soil. Since 2005, the advent of freely accessible satellite data made it possible to map urban extent and artiﬁcial impervious areas at the global scale. Despite of many existing eﬀorts in mapping GAIA, annual maps covering a relatively long period of time (i.e., more than 30 years) do not exist."

Therefore, in this research, we divided the whole world into arid areas and non-arid areas according to the global biome map (Olson et al., 2001). To improve the mapping eﬃciency on the GEE, we divided the whole world into 583 geographical grids (3.5º×3.5°), of which 155 grids contain arid biomes. The mapping procedures were implemented in all grids, using the full archive of Landsat time series images."

High resolution Google Earth images provide more spatial details of artificial impervious areas, while the Landsat time series data help us to locate the urban core in earlier years since most high resolution images became available after 2000. In addition, parts of sample units came from the training sample pool previously generated in our multi-class general-purpose global land cover mapping project (Gong et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2014)."
