These models allow for the assessment of multiple variables and their interactions, which might not be fully captured by traditional approaches. By evaluating different models and selecting the optimal one, it is possible to generate more reliable runoff depth distribution estimates, which in turn leads to more accurate runoff coefficients.",

These models aim to estimate the runoff depth and, subsequently, calculate the runoff coefficient distribution based on precipitation data from 2015, thereby aiding in the assessment and management of water resources in the 'Belt and Road' region.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve using global public data to build various machine learning models that relate runoff depth with terrain, climate, soil, and land use. The accuracy and effectiveness of different models are assessed to select the optimal model for estimating runoff depth. This optimal model is then used to generate the runoff depth distribution for the 'Belt and Road' region. Finally, the runoff coefficient distribution is calculated using the estimated runoff depth and precipitation distribution data from 2015.",
