            "description": "This data set contains eddy correlator observation data of huazhaizi desert station in the middle reaches of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.The station is located in zhangye city, gansu province.The longitude and latitude of the observation point are 100.31860E, 38.76519N/100.3201E, and 38.7659N(after May 2), with an altitude of 1731.00m.The frame height of the vortex correlator is 2.85m (before 12 April) /4.5m(after 2 May), the sampling frequency is 10Hz, the ultrasonic orientation is due north, and the distance between the ultrasonic anumometer (CSAT3) and the CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500/Li7500A(after 2 May)) is 15cm.\nThe original observation data of the vortex correlativity instrument is 10Hz, and the published data is the 30-minute data processed by Eddypro software. The main processing steps include: outliers, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (quadratic coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output by Eddypro software was also screened :(1) data when instrument error was eliminated;(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation are excluded;(3) remove the data with a missing rate of more than 10% in the original 10Hz data within every 30 minutes;(4) the observation data of weak turbulence at night (u* less than 0.1m/s) were excluded.The average observation period was 30 minutes, 48 data per day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.Suspicious data caused by instrument drift, etc., shall be marked in red font.On April 12, solstice and May 2, data was missing due to the calibration and instrument replacement of vortex correlator Li7500.\nThe published observational data include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (℃), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), Mr. Hoff length L (m), sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE,Quality indicator for co2 flux QA_Fc.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest is 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average of 0:00-0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Li et al. (2013), and for observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2011).",

                    "Question": "What does 'eddy covariance method' mean in the context of hydrometeorological data collection?",
                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance method, in the context of hydrometeorological data collection, refers to a technique used to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within the atmosphere. It involves using instruments like sonic anemometers and gas analyzers to capture high-frequency data (e.g., 10Hz) on wind speed, temperature, and gas concentrations (such as CO2 and H2O). This data is then processed to produce 30-minute averaged values of various fluxes, such as sensible heat, latent heat, and carbon dioxide, using software like Eddypro. The processing steps include outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, virtual temperature correction, and density correction. Quality assessment of the flux values is also performed, based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity tests.",

                    "Answer": "Data correction in hydrometeorological observations using eddy covariance systems arises from several factors, including the need to eliminate outliers, adjust for time delays, perform coordinate rotation, correct for frequency response, and resolve ultrasonic temperature and density (WPL) corrections. These corrections ensure the accuracy and reliability of the observed flux data, such as sensible heat, latent heat, and carbon dioxide fluxes, which are evaluated for quality based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics.",

                    "Question": "What are the potential consequences of employing data filtering methods such as outlier removal and quality assessment on the reliability and usability of hydrometeorological datasets collected through eddy covariance techniques?",
                    "Answer": "Employing data filtering methods like outlier removal and quality assessment can enhance the reliability of a dataset by minimizing errors and ensuring that only high-quality data is used for analysis. These methods help address issues such as instrument errors, data gaps due to calibrations or adverse weather conditions, and the effects of weak turbulence at night. However, they might also lead to data loss, especially if strict criteria are applied, potentially reducing the dataset's usability for certain analyses or long-term trend assessments. The choice of filtering criteria, like thresholds for turbulence or instrument error flags, plays a crucial role in balancing data quality with completeness.",
