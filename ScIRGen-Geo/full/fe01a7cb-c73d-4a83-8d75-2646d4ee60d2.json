            "description": "We propose an algorithm for ice crack identification and detection using u-net network, which can realize the automatic detection of Antarctic ice cracks. Based on the data of sentinel-1 EW from January  to February  every year, in order to suppress the speckle noise of SAR image, the probabilistic patch based weights (ppb) algorithm is selected for filtering, and then representative samples are selected and input into the u-net network for model training, and the ice cracks are predicted according to the trained model. Taking five typical ice shelves（Amery、Fimbul、Nickerson、Shackleton、Thwaiters) in Antarctica as an example, the average accuracy of classification results can reach 94.5%, of which the local accuracy of fissure area can reach 78.6%, and the recall rate is 89.4%.",

                "Crevasses have developed on almost all glaciers and ice shelves and are the direct result of glacier movement, reflecting the characteristics of glacier development and stresses. The crevasses contribute to the glacier mass balance through impacting the processes of meltwater transportation on the ice surface. Additionally, when sufficient surface meltwater infuses into crevasses, hydrofracturing may be induced, resulting in ice shelf instability; thus, crevasses are essential factors for assessing the stability of glaciers and ice shelves. Antarctic scientific research expeditions are also closely associated with crevasses because the rapid appearance of crevasses may herald the disintegration of the ice shelf and pose a serious safety hazard to field researchers. The orientation and distribution of crevasses can be used to distinguish the ice flow regimes and provide qualitative insight into trends in ice flow. Therefore, crevasses are critical not only for investigating the ice shelves’ stability as well as glacier dynamics but also for providing important safety guidance for glaciological field campaigns."

The modified U-Net network in this study (1) used a deconvolution layer (up-sampling 2 × 2) to replace the fully connected layer because the fully connected layer not only loses location information but also adds additional parameters. In addition, in such a deep neural network, we added the Batch Normalization (BN) layer before the input of each layer of the network to solve the problem of imbalanced data distribution and regularize the model. To improve the classification accuracy and avoid the phenomenon of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion in the training process, this study added skip connections after the convolutional layer. The model was compiled using the “binary cross-entropy” loss function, Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) optimizer, and an initial learning rate of 0.001. Finally, the model converged after 75 epochs."

For the distribution of crevasse types, the Nickerson Ice Shelf and the Shackleton Ice Shelf had various forms of crevasses.

                "AnswerEn": "Different ice shelves exhibit varying crevasse characteristics in terms of length, density, type, and spatial pattern. For instance, the Thwaites Glacier and Nickerson Ice Shelf in the West Antarctica Ice Sheet have shorter crevasses, while the Jelbart Ice Shelf and Amery Ice Shelf in the East Antarctica Ice Sheet have longer crevasses. The spacing and types of crevasses also differ, reflecting the different stress structures of the ice shelves.",

These modifications help maintain location information, regularize the model, balance data distribution, and prevent gradient issues during training, leading to improved classification accuracy.",
