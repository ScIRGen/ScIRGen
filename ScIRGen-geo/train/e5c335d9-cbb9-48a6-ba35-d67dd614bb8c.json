            "description": "Using daily observations from 2,839 gauges across China and nearby regions from 1961 to the present, this study compared eight different interpolation schemes that adjust the climatology based on monthly precipitation constraint and topographic characteristic correction, using an algorithm that combines the daily climatology field with a precipitation ratio field. Results from these eight interpolation schemes are cross validated using 45,992 high-density daily gauge observations from 2015 to 2019 over China. Of these eight schemes, the one with the best performance merges the Parameter-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) in the daily climatology field and interpolates station observations into the ratio field using an inverse distance weighting method. This scheme has a correlation coefficient of 0.78, a root-mean-square deviation of 8.8 mm/d, and a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.69 for comparisons between the 45,992 high-density gauge observations and the best interpolation scheme for the 0.1° latitude × longitude grid cells from 2015 to 2019. Therefore, this scheme is used to construct a new long-term gauge-based gridded precipitation dataset across mainland China (called CHM_PR, as a member of the China Hydro-Meteorology dataset) with spatial resolutions of 0.1°/0.25°/0.5°. This precipitation dataset is expected to facilitate the advancement of drought monitoring, flood forecasting, and hydrological modeling.",

In China, previous reconstructions from sparse and poor-quality gauge measurements have led to large biases in simulation of the interannual and seasonal variability of natural ﬂows. Balancing water supply and demand for sustainable water management across different regions is highly dependent on accurate, reliable surface ﬂow records. Collection of long-term observational streamﬂow datasets worldwide is necessary to provide an evidence-based foundation for hydrological studies. China has serious water scarcity problems given that it has only one-quarter of the world average of per capita freshwater resources. The uneven distribution of water resources driven by a monsoon climate and complicated topography has exacerbated water scarcity across China. In fact, observed ﬂow regimes are greatly affected by human activities, including water diversion, water withdrawal, and reservoir operation. Thus natural streamﬂow estimation is needed for comparison with previous streamﬂow records and to help interpret climate information (e.g., precipitation and temperature) in hydrometeorology studies. Hydrological models that incorporate both the physical and climatic characteristics of basins appear effective tools to reconstruct the ﬂow of a regulated river system."

These long-term national datasets are useful in the assessment and allocation of natural water resources, and in studying the impact of climate change on the terrestrial water cycle in China.

We ran the VIC model version 4.2 in water balance mode for daily time step increments. We also introduce a parameter-uncertainty analysis framework including sensitivity analysis, optimization, and regionalization, which further minimizes biases between modeled and inferred natural streamﬂow from natural or near-natural gauges. The VIC model was established on a 0.25°×0.25° grid, with meteorological forcing including daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and wind speed variables taken from 2,400 weather stations. We manually corrected the D8 ﬂow direction based on the 330 gauge locations, corresponding gauge areas, and high-resolution river ﬂowlines. To control the quality of the reconstructed streamﬂow data, a large dataset of monthly inferred natural/near-natural streamﬂow records from 1961 to 1979 for 330 gauge stations was used to train and test the models. Both the land-surface model and routing model were trained. For the routing model test, we checked that the number of upstream routing cells (0.25°×0.25°) matched the observed drainage area for each gauge station. Parameter regionalization transferred optimized parameters from gauged to ungauged catchments. We used four global sensitivity analysis methods to screen important parameters for the 10 water resources regions of China. Then an adaptive surrogate modeling-based optimization (ASMO) was used to find the optimal parameter solution. The multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique estimated values for the optimal parameter in ungauged areas. As a benchmark reference to natural records, streamﬂow data from a subset of 230 stations were used to train the coupled land-surface and routing model, thus reconstructing China’s natural streamﬂow. We tuned the sensitive parameters of modeled streamﬂow for each training station in succession from upstream to downstream during the calibration period (1961–1969) and estimated the corresponding parameters for ungauged areas."
