The classification results include four types: frozen surface, melted surface, desert and water body. The data covers the source area of three rivers, with a spatial resolution of 25.067525 km. It is stored in geotif format in the form of ease grid projection. Pixel values represent the state of freezing and thawing: 1 for freezing, 2 for thawing, 3 for deserts, 4 for water bodies. Because all TIF files in the dataset describe the scope of Sanjiangyuan National Park, the row and column number information of these files is unchanged, and the excerpt is as follows (where the unit of cellsize is m):\nncols 52\nnrows 28\ncellsize 25067.525\nnodata_value 0",

                "Near-surface freeze-thaw cycles are important indicators of global climate change. It is closely related to the spatial and temporal distribution of permafrost and seasonal frozen ground, their hydrothermal dynamics, and the interactions between land surface/hydrological processes and ecosystems. In the context of global warming, the onset of surface freezing is delayed, and the onset of thawing is advanced, resulting in varying degrees of permafrost degradation and shrinkage worldwide, and an extension of the growing season for vegetation. The freeze and thaw states of the surface significantly impact land-atmosphere energy exchanges, surface runoff, crop growth, and carbon cycles. Satellite remote sensing provides effective technical means for continuously monitoring near-surface freeze-thaw cycles on continental and regional scales. Among them, thermal infrared remote sensing is severely affected by weather conditions and cloud cover, while microwave remote sensing has strong penetration of atmospheric water vapor and aerosols, thus receiving more attention. In the microwave frequency band, the complex dielectric constant of liquid water differs significantly from other natural substances, making microwave signals highly sensitive to changes in liquid water in the soil. As the temperature decreases, most of the liquid water in the soil transforms into solid ice, leading to freeze-thaw cycles near the surface and a significant reduction in both the real and imaginary parts of the soil dielectric constant. This change in dielectric constant results in variations in surface brightness temperature and backscatter coefficient, enabling the monitoring of surface freeze-thaw states. Active microwave remote sensing (radar and scatterometers) and passive microwave radiometers are widely used in surface freeze-thaw monitoring, spring near-surface thaw monitoring, and vegetation growing season research."

Boundaries of daily frozen surface south, daily thawed surface north, and daily freeze/thaw cycle south/north move from southeast to northwest of China, with increasing surface temperatures, and then move back for decreasing surface temperatures.

                "Approximately 57% of land surfaces experience freezing and thawing processes annually in the northern hemisphere (Zhang et al., 2003). These processes have extensive and profound influences on the energy, water, and mass exchanges between the atmosphere and land surface and also affect surface runoff, plant growth, and engineering stability. The transitions in the surface soil between frozen and thawed states initiate the wintertime dormancy and summertime activity of the terrestrial processes; these transitions can also be characterized as a switch of the hydrological cycle and ecosystem activity (McDonald and Kimball, 2005). When the soil freezes in autumn, the liquid soil water largely becomes solid ice, resulting in a decrease in soil heat capacity and increase in soil thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the presence of a thin frozen soil layer near the ground surface dramatically decouples the water exchange between the atmospheric boundary layer and deeper soil layers (Zhang et al., 2003). When air temperatures increase above 0 °C during the early spring, the frozen land surface starts to thaw. Because of the substantial latent heat of fusion used in the snow melting process, the underlying surface soil remains frozen and restrains the snowmelt water from infiltrating the soil, resulting in an accelerated and enhanced generation of surface runoffs. As the frozen surface soil thaws with continued warming, the ecosystem becomes active (Goulden et al., 1998; Jarvis and Linder, 2000; Black et al., 2000). Therefore, the information on surface soil freeze-thaw states is important for determining the rates of soil respiration, plant photosynthesis, growing season, net primary production, and winter irrigation of cropland (Running et al., 1999). The spatial distribution of frozen ground surfaces varies substantially on daily, seasonal, and annual scales (Zhang et al., 2003). The timing at which the surface soil begins to freeze and thaw, and duration and total number of days at which the surface soil remains frozen also change substantially, especially as the climate changes. An overall understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of surface soil freeze-thaw cycle is important for research on climate change, hydrology, ecology, and agriculture. In situ observations can provide detailed information on the active layer in areas affected by frozen ground at the point scale, such as soil temperature and moisture profiles. However, it is difficult to represent the frozen ground distribution, and in situ observations are usually used to calibrate and validate the model simulations and remote sensing retrievals."

In this study, the dual-indices algorithm was calibrated using the in situ daily minimal ground surface temperature for each dominant land surface type and was used to produce a long time-series data set of surface soil freeze-thaw cycles for 30 years by combining the daily SMMR and SSM/I brightness temperatures. The seasonal and interannual variations in the areal extent and timing of soil freezing, trend of the onset date of surface freezing and thawing, and duration of surface thawing are analyzed throughout China to understand the response of frozen ground to climate change."

                "However, wavelength limitations only allow microwave sensing to provide surface soil freeze-thaw state information at a depth of 0–10 cm when using SMMR and SSM/I. Although the L-band microwave radiometer can penetrate frozen soil to a depth of 1 m, it is difficult to directly correlate soil freeze-thaw states with permafrost distribution. The in-depth analysis of the relationship between the surface soil freeze-thaw cycle and frozen ground distribution should be supported through the combination of a frozen soil model, data assimilation methods, field surveys, and long-term in situ observations."
