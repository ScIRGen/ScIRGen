            "description": "The Frequency distribution improved and wind-induced undercatch corrected gridded precipitation in Tibetan Plateau(1980-2009) is a dataset suitable for the Tibetan Plateau . It considers the measurement undercatch caused by wind and optimizes the precipitation frequency distribution by adopting an advanced interpolation method. The data is in NETCDF format, with a temporal resolution of 1 day and a horizontal spatial resolution of 10km. The data can be used as a reference data source for numerical model precipitation frequency correction.\n\tThis dataset uses daily observations from the China Meteorological Administration and GSOD at 164 stations as the data sources. The construction of the dataset is divided into four steps :(1) firstly, quality control is carried out on the gauge data, including the removal of abnormal values and bad values.(2) Doing wind-induced undercatch correction for every precipitation record.(3) A thin-plate splines interpolation algorithm considering altitude as a covariate is used to interpolate the monthly total precipitation, and the ratio of daily and monthly precipitation was interpolated by the Ordinary Kriging method. The dataset with a spatial resolution of 1km was obtained by multiplying the monthly total precipitation and day to month ratio. (4) Aggregating the 1km dataset to 10km spatial resolution to obtain the final data.\n\tCompared with the similar international gridded precipitation dataset, this data highlights for itâ€™s wind-induced undercatch correction of gauge precipitation and the optimized interpolation method to make itself  have more accurate frequency distribution. The data is suitable for correction of statistical deviation of precipitation output by numerical model or analysis of precipitation frequency characteristics at grid-box.\ny. It is more suitable for correcting the statistical deviation of precipitation output by numerical model or analyzing the precipitation frequency characteristics on gridded points.",

These include using daily observation data from 164 sources provided by the China Meteorological Administration and GSOD, performing quality control on this data to remove anomalies and bad values, compensating for observation losses primarily caused by wind, and applying interpolation methods that consider elevation. Specifically, a spline function is used to interpolate monthly precipitation totals, and ordinary kriging is employed to interpolate the ratio of daily to monthly precipitation. These methods are combined to produce data with a 1km spatial resolution, which is then averaged to a 10km resolution. This enables more accurate representation of precipitation frequency distribution and correction of observational losses caused by wind, making the dataset suitable for correcting numerical model precipitation frequency or analyzing precipitation frequency characteristics on a grid.",
