            "description": "Land Surface Temporature (LST) is a key parameter in global change research, and it has important for ecosystems and biogeochemistry. At present,  MODIS thermal infrared series satellite data is an important data source for land surface temperature estimation.The 1-kilometer and 8-day MODIS land surface temporature datasat of  key nodes (2000-2016) is obtained and stored by tailoring the land surface temperature estimation in 34 key nodes from 2000 to 2016 from MODIS products (MOD11A2). Based on the MOD11A2 production estimates land surface temperature by split-window algorithm, we modified the temperature inversion data by empirical fitting.",
