            "description": "The data set includes whole rock major and trace element contents of pegmatites from the boroujerd intrusive complex in western Iran, as well as major and trace elements of garnets selected from pegmatites. Garnet bearing pegmatites were collected from four outcrops of Ghale samurkhan, ghapanvari, ghare dash and sang-e sefid.\nThe coarse texture and mineral anisotropy (stratification) of many pegmatites make it difficult to collect representative samples for whole rock geochemical analysis. However, the boroujerd pegmatites studied did not show internal zonation, and according to Hutchison's (1974) suggestion, large enough samples were collected to overcome the deviation caused by large grain size. The samples were quartered by jaw crusher and powdered by agate grinder. The sample preparation and determination of major and trace elements in the whole rock were carried out in the State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Approximately 2 g of rock powder was accurately placed in a ceramic crucible, placed in a muffle furnace, held at 950 ℃ for 4 hours, then cooled and reweighed to determine the loss on ignition (LOI). Will be 1.200 ± 0.002 g of LOI powder was put into a platinum crucible and mixed with 9.600 g of LOI powder ± 0.002 g Li2B4O7 flux. The mixed powder was melted by v8c automatic melting machine at 1250 ℃ and cast into uniform glass pellets.\nThe abundances of major elements were measured by RIGAKU zsx100e X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF). The instrument was calibrated according to international standards, including USGS igneous rock standard. The analysis accuracy is better than 1%, and the accuracy of main elements is less than 5%; The detection limit of major elements is about 30 ppm.\nThe trace elements were analyzed by Perkin Elmer SCIEX Elan 6000 ICP-MS. About 50 mg of sample powder was accurately weighed into Teflon capsules, hf-hno3 solution was added, the capsules were sealed and placed in a high-pressure stainless steel container. The container was put into muffle furnace, heated at 250 ℃ for 24 hours, then quenched, the PTFE capsule was recovered, the cover was loosened, and the contents were dried on the heating plate. A new hf-hno3 solution was added to the PTFE capsules and the dissolution and drying procedures were repeated. The precipitate was dissolved in a 3% HNO 3 solution containing 5 ppb RH and 5 ppb re, which was used as an internal standard to monitor signal drift during analysis. Chinese national rock standards gsr-1 and gsr-3 and USGS standards agv-1, W-2, G-2 and GSP-1 are used to calibrate the element concentrations of the measured samples. The analysis accuracy is generally better than 5%.\nThe backscattered electron images and major element compositions of garnet were collected by using jeol jxa 8100 electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) and four wavelength dispersive spectrometers from the second Institute of Oceanography, State Oceanic Administration (Hangzhou, China). Operating conditions: 15 kV accelerating voltage, 20 Na beam current, 5 μ M beam diameter, 10 seconds peak value and 10 seconds acquisition time per background. Natural silicates and pure oxides provided by American standard materials company and China standard materials company are used to calibrate electron microprobes. The standard and test crystals used include iron aluminum garnet (Si and Al; Tap crystal), rutile (Ti; Pet crystal), hematite (Fe; LiF crystal), diopside (mg; Tap crystal), apatite (CA; Pet crystal), albite (NA; Tap crystal), potash feldspar (K; Pet crystal), andalusite (Mn; LiF crystal), chromite (CR; LiF crystal). The data are simplified by using the software of jeol, which uses ZAF matrix correction. The stoichiometry of garnet is obtained from the standardized analysis of 12 oxygen atoms. The calculated detection limit of analytical elements is better than 100 ppm. The analysis error of single element depends on absolute abundance; For elements with abundances between 0.5 and 1wt%, the relative abundance is 1 σ The accuracy is better than 10%. For elements with abundance between 1 and 10wt%, the relative accuracy is 1 σ The accuracy is better than 5%, and the relative accuracy is 1% for elements with abundance more than 10wt% σ The accuracy is better than 1%.\nLA-ICP-MS was used to determine the trace element composition of garnet in the Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. LA-ICP-MS instrument consists of Agilent 7900 ICP-MS and resoncials resolution 193nm laser, s-155 dual volume sample pool (designed to avoid cross contamination and reduce background washing time), squid smoothing device (used to improve the mixing and homogeneous flow velocity of ablation materials induced by laser ablation pulse) and computer-controlled high-precision X-Y platform. The sample aerosol after ablation is mixed with argon and nitrogen to improve the analytical sensitivity, and is transferred to the plasma torch in helium carrier gas. The laser works under 80 MJ dynamic energy, the attenuator value is 25%, the laser frequency is 8 Hz, and the spot diameter is 74 μ m。 Each analysis consists of a 25 second background acquisition (gas blank) followed by a 40 second sample data acquisition from the sample. The detection limits of trace elements by ICP-MS are mostly better than 10 ppb, and the uncertainty is 5-10%. Each analytical batch consists of two denudation of nist612 at the beginning and end, and five mineral samples in between. Nist612 standard glass is used as an external calibration standard, while nist610 is used as a monitoring standard for analysis to evaluate the accuracy and accuracy of the instrument. The SiO2 content of garnet determined by EPMA was collected from the point close to each laser ablation pit and used as an internal standard for calculating element abundance. The off-line analysis and integration of background and analysis signals, as well as time drift correction and quantitative calibration were performed using icpmsdata cal software.\nThe data set can be used to decipher the origin of pegmatite magma. The mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of pegmatite indicate that pegmatite is peraluminous to meta aluminous I-type granite. According to the mineral assemblage and whole rock geochemistry, pegmatites are divided into Muscovite type pegmatites. Electron microprobe analysis shows that garnet has concentric compositional zoning, and is a Fe Mn Al garnet solid solution with less mg Al garnet, CA al garnet and Ca Fe garnet. The concentric zoning of major elements in garnet is attributed to the growth of magma in melt. In the diagram of MnO + CaO / FeO + MgO (wt%), the composition of garnet is consistent with that of melt from weak to moderate crystallization. Garnet in boroujerd pegmatite is characterized by a gradual decrease in the contents of yttrium, hafnium, titanium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, hafnium and uranium from the center to the edge. Garnet also has a high chondrite normalized hree content, an almost flat pattern (YBN / SMN = 0 – 508), a low LREE content, and a negative Eu anomaly (EU / EU * < 0.3). The change of these elements from the core to the edge is attributed to the increase of magma fractionation. The compositional, major and trace element zoning patterns of garnet from boroujerd pegmatite are consistent with the origin of magma and the crystallization of different fractionated I-type magma, which indicates that garnet crystal chemistry is an important tool to decipher the origin of pegmatite magma.",
