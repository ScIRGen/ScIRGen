            "description": "The animal resources and their reasonable protection, development and utilization in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai Province are based on the comprehensive scientific investigation of Hoh Xil area carried out from May to August 1990. With the rapid increase of population in this century and the increasing intensity of human demand for natural resources, the resources have been seriously damaged, and the deterioration of natural environment and the increasing depletion of resources have become the focus of the world One of the most prominent problems in the world. In particular, the living environment of wild animals is still in a completely natural state, which is rare on earth. Most of Hoh Xil area is still a no man's land. It retains the original state of the ecosystem, and is also a refuge for many rare and unique resource animals. Therefore, it is a rare treasure land with rich animal resources in China and the world. Because of the bad natural conditions and the extremely difficult transportation in Hoh Xil area, zoologists have not been involved in this area for a long time. From May to August 1990, the animal group of the national comprehensive scientific investigation team of Hoh Xil region had the honor to go deep into the region to carry out resource investigation. They had a relatively clear understanding of the resource background and mastered a large number of first-hand materials, thus filling the scientific blank of animal resources in this region.",

                    "Answer": "During the 1990 comprehensive scientific investigation in the Qinghai Kekexili region, researchers employed on-site resource surveys to gather first-hand material about the animal resources. This approach was necessary due to the region's harsh natural conditions and transportation difficulties, which had historically limited access and exploration.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges of collecting data in remote and harsh environments like the Kekexili region include extreme natural conditions and transportation difficulties, which have historically limited access to the area. These challenges could influence data collection methodologies by necessitating the use of specialized equipment for remote data gathering, the deployment of mobile field teams capable of enduring harsh climates, and the reliance on innovative transportation solutions to reach isolated areas. Additionally, such challenges may require the development of unique strategies to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the collected data, given the limited time window and logistical constraints.",

                    "Answer": "The comprehensive scientific expedition conducted in the Qinghai Hoh Xil area from May to August 1990 managed to collect first-hand data on animal resources due to the focused efforts of the national scientific team, which included a dedicated animal group. Their persistence in overcoming the region's extremely harsh natural conditions and difficult transportation challenges enabled them to access areas that had remained scientifically unexplored, thus allowing for a clearer understanding of the area's animal resources and filling a significant gap in scientific knowledge.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of conducting the comprehensive scientific survey in the Qinghai Kekexili region were to gain a clear understanding of the animal resources in the area and to collect firsthand materials, thereby filling the scientific gap regarding the animal resources in this region. This was particularly crucial because the region, being largely an uninhabited area, retains a natural ecosystem and serves as a sanctuary for many rare and endemic animal species. The survey aimed to inform the rational protection and development of these resources against the backdrop of increasing human population and resource exploitation.",

                    "Answer": "In the Qinghai Kekexili area, the procedural steps for conducting a comprehensive scientific survey involved organizing a national scientific expedition team specifically focused on animal resources. The expedition took place between May and August 1990, during which the team ventured into this remote and harsh environment. This effort filled a scientific void, as previous zoological work had not been conducted in the region due to its difficult conditions. Therefore, the survey likely involved meticulous planning to address logistical challenges, collection of first-hand data, and in-depth analysis to understand the baseline of the animal resources in this untouched ecosystem.",

This was significant due to the region's harsh natural conditions and extreme transportation challenges, which had long prevented zoologists from accessing the area. The expedition resulted in the acquisition of substantial firsthand materials, thereby filling a scientific gap regarding the area's animal resources.",
