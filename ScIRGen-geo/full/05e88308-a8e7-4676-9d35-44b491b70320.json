            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of the evapotranspiration apparatus on January 1, 2013 (solstice) and December 31, 2013.The site is located in huailai county, hebei province, east garden town, the underlying surface for corn.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7880E, 40.3491N, and the altitude is 480m.\nThe collection frequency of evapotranspiration permeameter is 1 time/minute, and the released data is the average of 10 minutes.The evapotranspiration meter is a cylindrical structure with a surface area of 1m2 and a buried depth of 1.5m. The observation accuracy of evapotranspiration is 0.01mm.Two evapotranspiration seeptometers were installed, one kept bare soil (lysimeter_1), the other for the corn underlay (lysimeter_2) during the growing season (May 10 - September 15).Soil temperature and humidity probe, soil water potential probe and soil heat flow plate are also installed in the evapotranspiration apparatus.The buried depth of the soil temperature sensor is 5cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm and 140cm.The buried depth of the soil water sensor is 2cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm.The soil heat flux plate is buried 10cm underground;The buried depth of the soil water potential sensor was 30cm and 140cm.Processing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) delete the data of observation anomalies caused during maintenance;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the format of date and time is unified, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2013-6-10-10:30.\nThe observation data released by the evapotranspiration permeameter include:Date/Time, weighing mass (i.l._1_wag_l_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_l_000 (Kg)), seepage mass (i.l._1_wag_d_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_d_000 (Kg)), soil heat flux (Gs_1_10cm, Gs_2_10cm) (W/m2),Multi-layer soil moisture (Ms_1_2cm, Ms_1_10cm, Ms_1_20cm, Ms_1_40cm, Ms_2_2cm, Ms_2_10cm, Ms_2_20cm, Ms_2_40cm) (%),Multi-layer soil temperature (Ts_1_5cm, Ts_1_30cm, Ts_1_50cm, Ts_1_100cm, Ts_1_140cm, Ts_2_140cm, ts_2_2_5cm, ts_2_2_50cm, Ts_2_100cm, Ts_2_140cm) (℃), soil water potential (TS_1_30 (hPa), TS_1_140 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa));The data is stored in *.xls format.\nGuo et al, 2020 is used for site introduction and Liu et al, 2013 for data processing",

One lysimeter is left with bare soil, while the other is used under a maize canopy during the growing season. To ensure accurate measurements, lysimeters are equipped with soil temperature sensors at various depths (5cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm, 140cm), soil moisture sensors at depths (2cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm), and soil heat flux plates buried at 10cm depth. Additionally, soil water potential sensors are installed at 30cm and 140cm depths. Data is collected at a frequency of once per minute and averaged over 10-minute intervals. Quality control includes ensuring data completeness, removing anomalies during maintenance, and discarding data beyond physical or instrument limits. Data is stored in an Excel format with specified variables including date/time, weight, leachate mass, soil heat flux, soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil water potential.",
