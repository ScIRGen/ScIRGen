            "description": "The data was compiled from \"China's 1:100,000 wetland data\".\n\"China 1:100,000 wetland data\" mainly reflects the information of marshes and wetlands throughout the country in the 2000s, and is represented by geographical coordinates in decimal scale. The main contents include: types of marshes and wetlands, types of water supply, types of soil, types of main vegetation, and geographical regions.The information classification and coding standard of China sustainable development information sharing system was implemented.Data source of this database: 1:20 swamp map (internal version), 1:500 000 swamp map (internal version) of qinghai-tibet plateau, 1:100 000 swamp survey data and 1:400 000 swamp map of China;The processing steps are as follows: data source selection, preprocessing, marshland element digitization and coding, data editing and processing, establishment of topological relationship, edge-to-edge processing, projection transformation, connection with attribute database such as geographical name and acquisition of attribute data.",

The process involves selecting suitable data sources, preprocessing data, and ensuring the digital representation accurately reflects marsh wetland characteristics like type, water supply, soil type, and vegetation. Establishing topological relationships and handling edge matching during projection conversion can also introduce difficulties.",
