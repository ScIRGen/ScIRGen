            "description": "Leaf Area Index (LAI) is defined as half of the total Leaf Area within the unit projected surface Area, and is one of the core parameters used to describe vegetation. LAI controls many biological and physical processes of vegetation, such as photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, carbon cycle and precipitation interception, and meanwhile provides quantitative information for the initial energy exchange on the surface of vegetation canopy. LAI is a very important parameter to study the structure and function of vegetation ecosystem. This data set includes the monthly synthesis of 30m LAI products in Qilian mountain area in 2021. Max value composition (MVC) method was used to synthesize monthly LAI products on the surface using the reflectivity data of Landsat 8 and sentinel 2 channels from Red and NIR channels.",
