            "description": "The dataset contains the phenological camera observation data of the Daman Superstation in the midstream of Heihe integrated observatory network from August 28,2019 to December 31, 2019. The instrument was developed and data processed by Beijing Normal University. The phenomenon camera integrates data acquisition and data transmission functions. The camera captures data by look-downward with a resolution of 1280×720. For the calculation of the greenness index and phenology, the relative greenness index (GCC, Green Chromatic Coordinate, calculated by GCC=G/(R+G+B)) needs to be calculated according to the region of interest, then the invalid value filling and filtering smoothing are performed, and finally the key phenological parameters are determined according to the growth curve fitting, such as the growth season start date, Peak, growth season end, etc. For coverage, first, select images with less intense illumination, then divide the image into vegetation and soil, calculate the proportion of vegetation pixels in each image in the calculation area. After the time series data is extracted, the original coverage data is smoothed and filtered according to the time window specified by the user, and the filtered result is the final time series coverage. This data set includes relative greenness index (Gcc), phenological period and coverage (Fc).\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for sites information in the Citation section.",

The data acquisition and transmission functions are integrated into the camera, which allows for the specification of shooting frequency. For calculating the Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC), the relative greenness index is computed using the formula GCC=G/(R+G+B), where R, G, and B are the pixel values of the red, green, and blue channels of the image. This is followed by filling invalid values and applying smoothing filters to the data. Key phenological parameters like start, peak, and end of the growing season are determined by fitting a growth curve. For canopy cover, pre-processing of the data is done to select images with moderate lighting, then the images are segmented into vegetation and soil. The proportion of vegetation pixels is calculated for each image. Finally, the raw canopy cover data is smoothed using a user-specified time window to generate the final time series canopy cover.",
