            "description": "This data set mainly includes zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, trace element and in-situ Hf isotopic data of intrusive rocks (granites and dikes) in Xiaojiang Beizhang area, Zhejiang Province, major and trace geochemical data of whole rock and major geochemical data of minerals. The data were analyzed and tested by authoritative laboratories at home and abroad, and the data quality met the standard. Based on these data, the genesis of late Yanshanian granites and the specific mechanism of rich iron and magnesium in intermediate acid magma are defined. Combined with the existing research data of Cretaceous magmatic rocks along the southeast coast, the specific process and deep dynamic mechanism of paleo Pacific plate subduction are revealed, which provides important petrological evidence for the transformation of paleo Pacific plate movement mode in late Yanshanian.",

The process involves collecting rock samples, preparing them for laboratory analysis, and using precise instruments to measure isotopic compositions and elemental concentrations. The data quality meets established standards, ensuring reliability for determining the origin of Yanshanian granites and understanding the mechanisms of iron and magnesium enrichment in intermediate-acid magmas. This approach provides insights into the Cretaceous magmatic activities along the southeast coast and the subduction processes of the ancient Pacific Plate.",
