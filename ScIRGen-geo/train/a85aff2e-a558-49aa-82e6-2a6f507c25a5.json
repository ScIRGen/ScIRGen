            "description": "Estimate of the thermal state of the ocean is of vital importance to understand the process of air-sea interaction and footprint of climate change in the Indian Ocean. However, the insufficiency and poor coverage of subsurface observation brings quite a large challenge to estimate the subsurface temperature changes accurately. Moreover, surface observation from satellite contains well sample and could also reflect the subsurface information partly. We derived the ‘synthetic profiles’ based on the ‘surface-subsurface regression’ method in order to enrich the subsurface profiles. Then the 3-dimentional gridded temperature dataset are established by combining both the in-situ and synthetic profiles through objective analysis technique. Inter-comparison between the previous released datasets, such as IAP, EN4 and Ishii, this dataset could capture main thermal signal among the Indian Ocean and shows more mesoscale signal because of its higher resolution.\nThis dataset provides monthly mean gridded subsurface temperature estimate among 30E-105E, 45S-30N, ranging from 2005 to 2018. We provide with dataset which has horizontal resolution in quarter degree and 42 vertical levels from surface to 2000-m depth in netCDF format.",
            "instructions": "This dataset provides monthly mean gridded subsurface temperature estimate among 30E-105E, 45S-30N, ranging from 2005 to 2019. We provide two kinds of horizontal resolution- 1 degree and quarter degree and 42 vertical levels from surface to 2000-m depth in netCDF format.\nData file nomination: 3-dimentioanl sea temperature data has been stored in netCDF format, and named as \"Merged_IO_Temp_YYYY_MM_Quarter.nc\", where YYYY represents the year and MM represents the month. For example, Merged_IO_Temp_2005_01_Quarter.nc represents the 3-dimentioanl sea temperature among the Indian Ocean in January 2005. \nData reading method: All netCDF files in this dataset can be read directly using Matlab, NCL, python and other languages.",

These profiles are then integrated with high-quality observational subsurface profiles using optimal interpolation. Compared to traditional methods that rely solely on in-situ measurements, this approach can potentially offer higher spatial and temporal resolution, capturing more small- to medium-scale oceanic signals and providing a more comprehensive understanding of the Indian Ocean's thermal properties and air-sea interactions.",

By merging remote sensing data, which provides broad spatial coverage, with high-quality in-situ profiles, the dataset leverages the strengths of both data sources. This fusion enables the capture of major sea temperature variation features and facilitates the extraction of more small-to-medium scale signals, thereby enhancing our understanding of the Indian Ocean's contribution to global heat and moisture transport.",

High-quality inversion profiles are then selected and supplemented into the subsurface in-situ profile database provided by the UK Met Office.
