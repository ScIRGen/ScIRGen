            "description": "The dataset of evaportranspiration measured by micro-lysimeter was obtained at the super site (100m×100m, pure Qinghai spruce) around the Dayekou Guantan forest station. Observation items included the ground-based lidar scanning, the total station measuring, DGPS, tally investigation, LAI, canopy spectrum, camera observations of the canopy, soil evapotranspiration, the soil frozen tube observations, surface roughness, precipitation interception, soil moisture and dry-wet weight of the forest component.\n     Observation time was 18:00 every day from Jun. 1 to Dec. 31, 2008. 20 rain gauges, 4 self-made Lysimeter (diameter: 20cm) and the electronic balance were used.\n     Those provide reliable data for retrieval of evapotranspiration from remote sensing data.",

The instruments are chosen to provide reliable ground validation data for evapotranspiration models and remote sensing inversion. For instance, Lysimeters are utilized to measure changes in soil moisture by calculating the weight difference before and after observation, while rain gauges are used to measure rainfall both in open areas and beneath forest canopies to understand interception by vegetation.",

For instance, differences in the soil and vegetation within the four Lysimeters used, as well as potential inconsistencies in measuring weight changes with the electronic balance, could lead to deviations. Additionally, environmental factors affecting the water balance and the physical properties of the Lysimeters could contribute to unexpected results.",
