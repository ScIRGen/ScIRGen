Observation items included:\n     (1) the frost depth from 11:37-12:11 by the chopstick and the ruler. The soil was considered frozen when it was hard and with ice crystal. The cover type photos were archived.\n     (2) the gravimetric soil moisture (soil samples from 0-1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm, 5-10cm and 10-20cm) by the microwave drying method.\n     (3) the surface radiative temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer and the physical temperature by the thermocouple thermometer. \n     (4) the soil roughness, which can be acquired from related dataset of other period.",

A ruler is used for direct measurement. When the soil hardness is significant and ice crystals are present, the soil is considered frozen; otherwise, it is considered unfrozen.",

                    "Answer": "The method of using chopsticks and rulers to measure soil freeze-thaw depth relies on subjective assessment of soil hardness and ice crystal presence. In diverse soil types and conditions, this method may lead to variations in accuracy due to differences in soil texture, moisture content, and freeze-thaw characteristics. For instance, in finer soils or soils with higher organic content, the presence of moisture may affect perceived hardness, while in coarser soils, the method might underestimate freeze depth due to less obvious freeze indicators. Consequently, data accuracy and soil temperature interpretation may be impacted, leading to potential discrepancies in understanding soil freeze-thaw dynamics.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps for measuring soil moisture content involve collecting soil samples from various depths, specifically 0-1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm, 5-10cm, and 10-20cm, and placing them in resealable bags. These samples are then dried using a microwave to calculate the soil moisture content by weight. For surface temperature measurement, a handheld infrared thermometer is used to measure both radiation temperature and physical temperature, recording the surface cover type at the measurement location. The infrared thermometer is used in a close-range mode, and a thermocouple thermometer attached to the infrared thermometer is used for measuring the physical temperature.",
