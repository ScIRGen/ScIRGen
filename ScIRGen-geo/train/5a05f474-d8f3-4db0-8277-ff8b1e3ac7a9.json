            "description": "Demingding is a less studied post collisional porphyry copper molybdenum deposit, which is located in the east of Gangdise porphyry copper belt. This paper provides LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating, whole rock geochemistry and zircon trace element data of biotite porphyry in Deming top. Zircon U-Pb dating shows that the weighted average 206 Pb / 238 u age of Miocene biotite porphyry is 20.36 ± 0.46ma (mswd = 2.6, n = 21). Miocene biotite porphyry has high SiO_ 2、K_ 2O and Al_ 2O_ 3, and shows characteristics similar to adakite. These rocks have high Sr / y ratio and fractionated REE mode with low hree abundance. Compared with HFSE, they are enriched in lile with (87 Sr / 86 SR) I value of 0.7059 ~ 0.7062, ε Nd (T) value is − 2.35 ~ − 1.67, and (- 206 Pb / 204 Pb) I value is 18.50 ~ 18.55. These characteristics are similar to other Miocene adakitic intrusive rocks in the Gangdise belt. We believe that biotite porphyry has the same petrogenesis as other Miocene ore bearing intrusive rocks in the eastern Gangdise belt. Its genesis comes from the mixing of subduction transformation, remelting of metamorphic lower crust of Tibet and hydrated mafic magma metasomatizing the mantle of Tibet. Zircon in biotite porphyry has only very small negative Eu anomaly (Eun / Eun * > 0.3), with large Ce ~ (4 +) / Ce ~ (3 +) ratio (average 113), 10000 ~ * (Eun / Eun *) / Y (3.94 ~ 8.14 > 1), CE / Nd (9-58, average 30), (CE / nd) / Y (0.008 ~ 0.127 > 0.003), dy / Yb (0.15-0.24, < 1); 0.3), indicating that biotite porphyry has relative hydration and oxidation. Therefore, biotite porphyry is considered to be a relatively enriched intrusion with certain exploration potential.

This method involves measuring the ratios of uranium to lead isotopes within zircon crystals, which are often used because they can retain isotopic information for billions of years, allowing researchers to determine the age of the rock formation.",
