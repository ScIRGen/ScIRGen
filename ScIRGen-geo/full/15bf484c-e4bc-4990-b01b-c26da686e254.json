            "description": "These data are digitized for the Geocryological Regionalization and Classification Map of the Frozen Soil in China (1:10 million) (Guoqing Qiu et al., 2000; Youwu Zhou et al., 2000), adopting a geocryological regionalization and classification dual series system. The geocryological regionalization system and classification system are used on the same map to reflect the commonality and individuality of the formation and distribution of frozen soil at each level.\n    The geocryological regionalization system consists of three regions of frozen soil: (1) the frozen soil region of eastern China; (2) the frozen soil region of northwestern China; and (3) the frozen soil region of southwestern China (Tibetan Plateau). Based on the three large regions, 16 regions and several subregions are further divided. In the division of the geocryological boundary in the frozen soil area, the boundary between major regions I and III mainly consults the results of Bingyuan Li (1987). The boundary between major regions II and III is the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau, which is the Kunlun Mountains-Altun Mountains-Northern Qilian Mountains and the piedmont line. The boundary between major regions I and II is in the area of Helan Mountain-Langshan Mountain. The boundary of the secondary region is divided by the geomorphological conditions in regions II and III. However, in region I, it is mainly divided by the ratio of the annual temperature range A to the annual mean temperature T, and the frozen depths of various regions are taken into consideration.\nThe classification system is divided into 8 types based on the continuity of frozen soil, the time of existence of frozen soil and the seasonal frozen depth. The various classifications of boundaries are mainly taken from the \"Map of Snow, Ice and Frozen Ground in China\" (1:4 million) (Yafeng Shi et al., 1988) and consult some new materials, whereas the seasonal frozen soil boundary is mainly based on the weather station data. The definitions of each classification are as follows:\n(1) Large permafrost: the continuous coefficient is 90%-70%;\n(2) Large-island permafrost: the continuous coefficient is 70%-30%;\n(3) Sparse island-shaped permafrost: the continuous coefficient is <30%;\n(4) Permafrost in the mountains;\n(5) Medium-season seasonal frozen soil: the maximum seasonal frozen depth that can be reached is >1 m;\n(6) Shallow seasonal frozen soil: the maximum seasonal frozen depth that can be reached is <1 m;\n(7) Short-term frozen soil: less than one month of storage time; and\n(8) Nonfrozen soil.\nAccording to the data, China's permafrost areas sum to approximately 2.19 × 106 km², accounting for 22.83% of China's territory. Among those areas, the mountain permafrost is found over 0.42×106 km2, which is 4.39% of the territory of China. The seasonal frozen soil area is approximately 4.76×106 km², accounting for 49.6% of China's territory, and the instantaneous frozen soil area is approximately 1.86×106 km², i.e., 19.33% of China's territory.\nFor more information, please see the references (Youwu Zhou et al., 2000).",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for defining permafrost types based on continuous coefficient and seasonal freezing depth involve using data from sources like ice and snow maps and meteorological stations to categorize permafrost into types such as large continuous permafrost or shallow seasonal permafrost. In contrast, delineating permafrost regions using geomorphological conditions and temperature ratios involves using geographical boundaries and climate data to separate regions into major permafrost zones and further into sub-zones. This method focuses more on macro-scale environmental conditions, whereas the type-based method is more detailed at the micro-scale.",

This detailed classification can inform climate models by providing data on the spatial extent and thermal dynamics of permafrost, which are crucial for understanding soil thermal regimes, greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost, and hydrological changes in cold regions.",

This approach reflects the commonalities and uniqueness of permafrost formation and distribution across various levels. By categorizing the regions into major permafrost zones and further into subzones, and by defining types based on continuity, presence duration, and seasonal depth, the dataset aims to improve our understanding of permafrost distribution and characteristics. This detailed information is crucial for assessing the extent of permafrost and its impact on environmental and climatic conditions in China.",

This includes referencing results from previous studies, such as those by 李炳元 (1987), and using geographic and climatic criteria, such as the ratio of annual temperature range to average annual temperature, freezing depth, and geomorphological conditions.
