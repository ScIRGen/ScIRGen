                "Soil moisture (SM) is a critical indicator of the water and energy budgets at the land surface, and a key variable that links the land surface and atmosphere. In recent years, remote-sensing data have rapidly become a primary data source of SM. Microwave remote sensing has become increasingly essential and is widely used in soil moisture monitoring. This approach allows both daytime and nighttime observations under all weather conditions and can effectively penetrate vegetation and observe the underlying surfaces. Moreover, microwave remote sensing strongly depends on the dielectric properties of soil, which are a complex function of soil moisture. Currently, the most widely used operational passive microwave remotely sensed SM products originate from SMAP, SMOS, FY3B, and AMSR2, with AMSR2 mainly including the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) products. SMOS provides the first L-band (1.4 GHz) SM products (2009 to present), and SMAP provides another L-band (1.41 GHz) SM products (2015 to present). These products are considered the most promising sensors for SM monitoring because the L-band is more sensitive to SM and more easily penetrates vegetation layers than other bands with higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which is known as the third pole, is the headstream of massive major rivers that nourish billions of people living downstream across Asia. Because of the combined influence of rapid global climate change and increasingly dense human activities, the QTP is currently facing a series of surface variations, such as glacial melting, permafrost degradation, and enhanced freezing and thawing. The surface SM of the plateau has also shown strong dynamic changes. High-accuracy SM products are required for hydrological studies over the QTP and its surrounding areas."

This study reveals some of the reasons for the different performances of these five SM products, mainly from the perspective of the parameterization schemes of their corresponding retrieval algorithms. This study provides quantitative evidence to better understand the uncertainties of SM products and explain errors that originate from the retrieval algorithms."
