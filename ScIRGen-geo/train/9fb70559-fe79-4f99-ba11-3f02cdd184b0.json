Among them, the flow data refers to the section flow of Heihe River, and the water level data refers to the water level at the runoff densification observation point in the middle reaches of hiwater. The reliability of monthly data is higher than that of daily data, and the reliability of flow is higher than that of water level.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the species composition and diversity of understory flora can be influenced by canopy species and structure, stand management, ground disturbances, light resources, litter properties, and soil nutrients and pH. Topography can also significantly alter microclimates and resource availability under the tree canopy and in turn influence understory species composition and diversity. Understory vegetation in coniferous forests, hardwood forests, and mixed-wood forests has been well studied, and the latter two forest types are widely accepted to be more favorable to biodiversity than coniferous forests."

                "We hypothesized that understory species composition would differ significantly between them and that juniper forest would have a more diversified understory plant community than spruce forest, because Picea species generally support fewer understory species than Pinus and Larix. Additionally, we tried to determine the extent to which topographic variables and site conditions could explain the variation in understory species composition of coniferous forests."

                "We compared understory species composition by multi-response permutation procedure and indicator species analysis between plots dominated by Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) and Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) in coniferous forests of the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China. Using constrained ordination and the variation partitioning model, we quantitatively assessed the relative effects of two sets of explanatory variables on understory species composition. We established 27 plots of 20×20m for vegetation survey at elevations ranging from 2660m to 3480m; 16 plots were in spruce forest and 11 plots in juniper forest. Each 20×20m plot was subdivided into four 10×10m quadrats, three of which were randomly selected to survey shrub species. Herbaceous species were investigated within five 1×1m quadrats, one in the center and four at the corners of the 20×20m plot."

Five topsoil samples (0–10cm depth) were randomly collected in each plot with a stainless steel cylindrical soil sampler of 5cm in diameter. Then, we thoroughly mixed the samples in each plot to form a composite sample for subsequent analysis."

            "findings": [
                "Understory species composition differed markedly between the forest types. Many heliophilous species were significantly associated with juniper forest, while only one species was indicative of spruce forest. The results showed that topographic variables had higher explanatory power than did site conditions for understory plant distributions. Forward selection revealed that understory species distributions were primarily affected by elevation and aspect. Juniper forest had higher species richness and α-diversity and lower β-diversity in the herb layer of the understory plant community than spruce forest, suggesting that the former may be more important in maintaining understory biodiversity and community stability in alpine coniferous forest ecosystems."

These challenges can affect the accuracy and reliability of the estimates, as they require sophisticated integration of models and observational data to ensure validity. The reliability of monthly data is higher than daily data, and the reliability of flow data is higher than water level data, indicating that while the methods are robust, there are inherent limitations due to data availability and model assumptions.",

Such integration allows for a more comprehensive understanding by filling in gaps with model simulations and observational verifications. In the context of the Heihe River, this approach helps in reconstructing flow and water level data over a long historical period, thereby supporting ecological and hydrological research with high-resolution data.",

In alpine coniferous forests, factors such as elevation, aspect, and slope position need to be carefully considered to accurately assess species composition and diversity. These variables have high explanatory power and are crucial for understanding the distribution patterns of vegetation, thus informing the placement and methodology of data collection efforts to ensure comprehensive coverage and valid results.",
