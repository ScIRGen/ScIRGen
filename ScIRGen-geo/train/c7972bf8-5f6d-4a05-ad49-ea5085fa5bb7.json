            "description": "This data is the data of the automatic weather station (AWS, Campbell Company) in the surface moraine area of Galongla 24k Glacier at the Tibetan Southeast Alpine Environment Comprehensive Observation and Research Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The geographic coordinates are 29.765 ° north latitude, 95.712 ° east longitude and 3950 m above sea level. The data include daily arithmetic mean data of air temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), net radiation (w/m2), water vapor pressure (Kpa) and air pressure (mbar). In the original data, an average value is recorded every 30 minutes before October 2018, and an average value is recorded every 10 minutes thereafter. The temperature and humidity are measured with HMP155A temperature and humidity probe. The net radiation probe model is NR01, the atmospheric pressure sensor probe is PTB210, and the wind speed sensor is 05103. These probes are 2 m high from the ground. In terms of data quality: due to the snow cover in spring, the error caused by the snow and ice on the radiation probe has been eliminated. The modified data can be used by researchers in glacier, meteorology and hydrology. This data is an update of the published data \"East South Tibet Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences: Basic Meteorological Data of 24k Glacier Surface Moraine Area (2018-2019)\", which will be updated according to the situation in the future\n\n(Note: when using, it must be indicated in the article that the data is from South East Tibetan plateau Station for integrated observation and research of alpine environment, CAS)",

                    "Answer": "An automatic weather station (AWS) refers to a setup for collecting meteorological data automatically at regular intervals. In the context of meteorological data collection, AWS typically includes various sensors and instruments, such as temperature and humidity probes, radiation sensors, pressure sensors, and wind speed sensors, which are all positioned at specific heights and locations to gather accurate environmental data. This setup allows for the continuous and systematic recording of weather-related parameters, which can then be used for research in fields like glaciology, meteorology, and hydrology.",

                    "Answer": "The shift from recording average values every 30 minutes to every 10 minutes in a dataset could potentially improve the accuracy and granularity of data analysis. This change allows for capturing more precise variations in meteorological conditions over shorter periods, providing a finer temporal resolution that can enhance the understanding of dynamic environmental processes. However, this increase in data volume could also introduce challenges in data management and processing, requiring more advanced computational resources and methodologies to handle the denser datasets effectively.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection in glacier environments involves setting up automated weather stations (AWS) with specific sensors for temperature, humidity, wind speed, net radiation, vapor pressure, and air pressure. The sensors used include HMP155A for temperature and humidity, NR01 for net radiation, PTB210 for atmospheric pressure, and 05103 for wind speed, all positioned 2 meters above ground. It's crucial to account for and correct any errors, such as those caused by snow and ice accumulation on radiation probes, to ensure high data quality. Regular updates and removal of erroneous data points are important steps for maintaining dataset reliability.",
