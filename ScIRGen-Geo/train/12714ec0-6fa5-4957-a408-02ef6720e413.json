        "Tianshan Mountain System (TMS), one of the seven major mountain ranges in the world and west-to-east orientation, is located in the center region of Eurasia which is about 4000 m of average altitude, and extends across China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The TMS plays a pivotal implication in people’s lives owing to its abundant water resources, mineral resources, plant resources, and animal resources. Importantly, the glacier change is a direct result of climate change influenced by the meteorology. Consequently, the analysis of glacier surface meteorological elements of the Western Tianshan Mountain Station (WTMS) and Eastern Tianshan Mountain Station (ETMS) is one of the main contents of glacier-climate change research, which is not only important to reveal and discover the dynamic changes of microclimate in glacier regions. Many researchers had claimed the rapid impact on climate change in the recent years, and the reasons behind were natural as well as anthropogenic influences of pollutant sources (Akorede et al.2012). Climate change is likely to change the snow cover area and alter the water availability in the future making long-term water management more challenging (Khadka et al.2014). At the same time, the variation of meteorological parameters observed over the WTMS and ETMS is closely connected with the variation of climate change."

      "research objective": [
        "In this paper, the meteorological variables such as air temperature (AT, °C), atmospheric pressure (AP, hPa), relative humidity (RH, %), wind direction (WD, deg) and wind speed (WS, m/s) were obtained from the WTMS glacier area located in the TMS for the period during September 2016–May 2017, and are analyzed and studied extensively. Further, the differences of meteorological parameters obtained from the WTMS and ETMS are delivered, and possible reasons are given which will provide a reference for the glacier surfaces responding to climate change in the context of global warming. Henceforth, the main purpose of this study is to verify the credibility of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in the Tianshan Mountains."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "The meteorological data over the WTMS is still scarce due to lack of observations, even blank; and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data are relatively coarse which causes the large uncertainty for the credibility in this study area. However, some observational data are missing or not collected due to severe weather conditions and lack of human resources to maintain the instrument in time with unstable power. In particular, the lack of data in summer is very serious, it does not have typical representativeness, so this paper does not select the complete summer data for the analysis."

      "methods": [
        "In this paper, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data are interpolated to obtain the meteorological factors in the WTMS. Using the data obtained from the WTMS, the daily and seasonal variations of key meteorological parameters (AT, AP, RH, WD and WS) measured from 8th September 2016 to 23th May 2017, as well as changes in the TR obtained during October 2016, January, April, and July 2017 was preliminary studied and analyzed. In addition, to understand the variations of meteorological elements near the snow surface between the eastward and westward Tianshan mountains, the comparison and analysis were performed combined with the data observed from the Daxigou Glacier Automatic Meteorological Station (AMS) over the Eastern Tianshan Mountain Station (Daxigou Station, ETMS, 43°06′N, 86°50′E, altitude 3544 m)."

        "The results revealed are as follows: (1) the observed data between the WTMS and ETMS presented high correlations, and the meteorological parameters detected from the ETMS were certainly representative of the variations in the WTMS. (2) The RH in the two regions showed comparatively high values ranging from 40% to 70% indicate the abundant amount of atmospheric water vapor content near the ground in the Tianshan Mountain area. (3) The predominant WD both in the WTMS and ETMS near the ground was along the south-east direction, with the values of WS between 0 and 2 m/s were accounted the largest proportion in two stations. (4) The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data can reflect the changes in the synoptic weather scale of AT, RH, and AP to some extent. (5) The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data of AT and RH were underestimated by 7.2% and 45.2% in the WTMS, respectively. Whereas, the values of AP, WD, and WS were overestimated by 83.8%, 28.8%, and 74.3%, respectively over the WTMS."
