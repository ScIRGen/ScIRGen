            "description": "The Antarctic and Arctic bacterial distribution data set provides distribution characteristics of bacteria in the Arctic and Antarctic. The collection period of the samples was from December 13,2005, to December 8,2006; 52 samples were obtained from 3 Arctic regions (Spitsbergen Slijeringa, Spitsbergen Vestpynten, and Alexandra Fjord_Highlands), and 171 samples were obtained from 5 Antarctic regions (the Mitchell Peninsula, Casey station main Power house, Robinsons Ridge, Herring Island, and Browning Peninsula). The soil surface samples were stored in liquid nitrogen after collection, shipped to a Sydney laboratory, and extracted using the FastPrep DNA kit. The extracted DNA samples were processed by 27F (5'-GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCA-3' and 519R (5'-GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG-3') to amplify the 16S rRNA gene fragments. The amplified fragments were sequenced by the 454 method, and the raw data were analyzed by Mothur software. First, the sequences with poor sequencing quality were removed, the sequences were then sorted, and the chimera sequences were removed. The similarities between the sequences were calculated, the sequences with similarities above 97% were clustered into one OTU, and the OTU representative sequence was defined. By comparison with the Silva database, the OTU sequences with reliabilities greater than 80% were identified as level one. This data system compared the diversity of microorganisms in the eastern Antarctic with that in the Arctic and is of great significance for the study of the distributions of microorganisms in the Antarctic and Arctic.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of microbial diversity studies, 'OTU' stands for Operational Taxonomic Unit. It is used to classify groups of closely related individuals based on sequence similarity, typically at a threshold of 97% similarity for 16S rRNA gene sequences. An OTU represents a cluster of sequences that are used as a proxy for species or taxa in microbial ecology studies.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method involves collecting soil surface samples from both the Arctic and Antarctic regions and preserving them using liquid nitrogen. These samples are then transported to a laboratory for DNA extraction using the FastPrep DNA kit. The genetic analysis process includes amplifying the 16S rRNA gene fragments using specific primers (27F and 519R), followed by sequencing with the 454 method. The raw data is analyzed using Mothur software to remove low-quality sequences and chimeras, and OTUs are defined based on sequence similarity of over 97%. The representative OTU sequences are compared against the Silva database for genus-level identification with reliability greater than 80%.",

                    "Answer": "The underlying reasons for using liquid nitrogen preservation and FastPrep DNA extraction methods in bacterial distribution studies in polar regions include the need to maintain the integrity and viability of bacterial samples during transportation from remote and harsh environments, such as the Arctic and Antarctic, back to a laboratory setting. Liquid nitrogen preservation ensures that the samples remain stable and uncontaminated until DNA extraction. The FastPrep DNA extraction method is chosen for its efficiency in lysing cells and extracting high-quality DNA from soil samples, which is crucial for accurate downstream analysis like 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing.",

                    "Answer": "Using DNA extraction and sequencing techniques, such as the FastPrep DNA kit and 454 sequencing, on polar soil samples allows researchers to identify and analyze the distribution characteristics of bacteria in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. This method can reveal microbial diversity and distribution patterns, facilitating a better understanding of polar biodiversity. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments and the classification of sequences into OTUs based on similarity further enhance the ability to identify bacterial taxa, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of microbial ecosystems in these extreme environments.",

This data is significant for studying the diversity and distribution of microbes in the Arctic and Antarctic.",
