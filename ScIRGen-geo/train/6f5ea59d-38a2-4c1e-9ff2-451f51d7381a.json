            "description": "The maximum freezing depth is an important index of seasonally frozen ground. Observation and simulation show that the maximum freezing depth is decreasing. In this paper, the data set of maximum freezing depth for 2050s (2041-2060) and 2090s (2081-2100) in the Third Pole under the scenarios of SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 is released, with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The data set is obtained by using the average of 200 set simulations of the support vector regression model in the baseline period (2001-2010). The validation results show that the support vector regression model has good accuracy and stability. Based on this data set, it is found that under four climate scenarios, the maximum freezing depth in the Third Polar from 2001 to 2100 will be significantly reduced by 10.41 cm (11.69%), 24.00 cm (26.95%), 37.71 cm (42.34%) and 47.71 cm (53.57%), respectively. This data set provides data support for the study of seasonally frozen ground in the Third Pole, Asian mountains and other regions.",

Recent studies have shown that the MSFD has continued to decrease over the past few decades. The MSFD on the QTP declined by an average of 4.9 cm per decade from 1960 to 2014. The mapping methods of the MSFD include empirical models, physical models and statistical/machine learning models. The in situ observed data play an important role in the calibration and validation of the MSFD model because of its high accuracy. Statistical/machine learning models are an alternative approach for simulating the MSFD. Remote sensing provides important technical means and environmental variables for observing the thermal state of frozen ground. Many previous studies have shown that it is feasible to estimate the freezing/thawing state of soil using microwave remote sensing, because it is very sensitive to the near surface dielectric properties and has the ability to penetrate clouds."

Then, four statistical/machine learning models with different predictors were compared based on the results of cross-validation, and an optimal model combination (i.e., machine learning model with predictors that performed better than others) was used to simulate the MSFD on the QTP. Finally, the transferability of the model for the baseline period was tested. Tenfold cross-validation was used to evaluate the predictive performance of each machine/statistical model. A total of 184 ground-measured SFD sample points were collected from 2001 to 2010 on the QTP. For each model, 165 sample points were used for model training, and the remaining 19 sample points were used for model validation. To reduce the uncertainty of the model, each model was run 200 times, and the arithmetic average was used as the final simulation accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R 2) and bias (mean difference) were used to evaluate the performance of the model."

The altitude of these sites was 846–4800 m, and the MSFD was 3.7–276.6 cm.

The SVR model with climate predictor calibration using the in situ MSFD at the baseline period (2001–2010) can be used to simulate the MSFD over historical periods (1981–1990 and 1991–2000).
