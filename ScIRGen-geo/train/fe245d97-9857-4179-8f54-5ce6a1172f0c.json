            "description": "According to the method of dendrology, tree cores of Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana) in central (Houxia, Urumqi) and western Tianshan Mountains (kuruning, Yili) were collected. Through the traditional method of dendrology, the sample was processed and dated according prescriptive process. We established the width chronology of Schrenk spruce (Picea schrenkiana) in central and western Tianshan Mountains. As the method of tree ring isotope, four tree cores were selected. After cleaning and air-dried, tree rings were separated five-year increments suing a scalpel under a microscope. Hg concentrations were analyzed in duplicate following the established procedures on a Leeman Hydra IIC Direct Hg Analyzer (Teledyne Leeman Labs, Hudson, NH, USA). The principle of the analytical method is cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometer after thermal decomposition and amalgamation of a gold trap following the US EPA method 7473 (USEPA 1998). The enhanced Hg pollution, especially at low-frequency, was revealed, which was consistent with the changes of global Hg deposition. In central Tianshan Mountains, Hg values showed strong anthropogenic impacts and reflected the local Hg emission loading. Compared to the ice-core Hg records on the Tibet Plateau, our outcomes presented the dramatic increasing trend after the World War Ⅱ. We suggested that tree rings in remote area can be employed to reflect the low-frequency and large-scale Hg deposition and can benefit to accurate the Hg emission inventory in China.",

                    "Answer": "The method of using tree rings to measure historical mercury concentrations provides a regional mercury pollution record with a focus on low-frequency changes, highlighting human impact as a significant factor in the central region of the Tianshan Mountains. Compared to ice cores, tree rings have shown a more rapid increase in mercury concentrations after World War II, suggesting that in remote areas, tree rings can effectively serve as regional mercury pollution detectors and reflect low-frequency trends.",

                    "Answer": "The gradual increase in mercury concentrations in the tree rings suggests that mercury emissions have been intensifying over time, potentially reflecting global trends in mercury release. The data indicate that in the central Tianshan Mountains, human activities are the primary contributors to mercury emissions. The tree rings serve as an effective tool for detecting regional mercury pollution, revealing changes in mercury deposition over time. Compared to ice core records, the tree rings show a sharp increase in mercury levels after World War II, highlighting the tree rings' sensitivity to anthropogenic influences in remote areas.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in mercury concentration in tree rings over time can be attributed to factors such as increased human emissions, as observed in the Tian Shan region where human activities are the main influencing factor. This trend aligns with global mercury emission patterns, indicating that regional tree rings can serve as indicators of lower frequency mercury concentration changes. The observed sharp increase in mercury levels in tree rings post-World War II, compared to ice core records, suggests significant anthropogenic influence.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing tree rings as a primary data collection method for detecting regional mercury pollution trends in remote areas can reveal low-frequency mercury concentration changes over time. This method shows that in the remote regions of Tianshan, tree rings can act as effective indicators of mercury deposition changes, reflecting increasing pollution trends that align with global mercury emissions. The tree ring data indicate that human emissions are a significant influencing factor, and there is a notable rise in mercury concentration in tree rings post-World War II, which is more pronounced compared to ice core records.",
