This is a merged product from three model-based E products using the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) method which minimizes errors. These include the fifth-generation ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA5), the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS).\nTo facilitate user-friendly access and download the dataset is stored individually for each year in a separate file. These files contain daily and monthly mean data (e.g., REA_1980_day.nc and REA_1980_mon.nc). The dataset is stored in NetCDF format, containing the variable E, representing land evaporation, produced in millimeters (mm) as a unit. There are three dimensions included in the dataset: longitude, latitude, and time, with the longitude ranging from -179.875E to 179.875E, the latitude from -59.875N to 89.875N. Complete time coverage is from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 2017.",

                "Land evaporation plays an important role in the exchange of energy, water and carbon in the terrestrial biosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. It is one of the dominant components of land water and the energy budget, as well as a key driver of drought episodes (Seneviratne, 2012; Sheffield et al., 2012). The strength of the hydrological cycle determines water availability and affects the climate system in a variety of ways (Mueller et al., 2013). Apart from hydrological applications, land evaporation change is also related to air temperature change and extreme high temperature conditions (Seneviratne et al., 2006, 2010; Hirschi et al., 2011; Mueller and Seneviratne, 2012). Since the land surface is more heterogeneous than the ocean, it is difficult to estimate land evaporation accurately due to huge uncertainties resulting from complex land–atmosphere feedback processes. Recently, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been discovered as an emerging technique to observe the photosynthetic processes of vegetation by quantifying the emission of fluorescent radiation (Joiner et al., 2014). Remotely sensed SIF has potential to empirically track the variation in canopy-level transpiration (Lu et al., 2018; Shan et al., 2019)."
