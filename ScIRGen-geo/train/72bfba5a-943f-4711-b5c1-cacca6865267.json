            "description": "The hydrological ecological process at the loess basin scale and its response to global climate change is a project of the Major Research plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China - Environmental and Ecological Science in Western China. The project is led by liu wenzhao, a researcher from the institute of water and soil conservation, ministry of water resources, Chinese academy of sciences. The project runs from January 2003 to December 2005.\nThe project submitted data:\nThe CLIGEN parameter and output dataset of the Loess Plateau: It was generated during the evaluation and improvement of the practicality of the weather generator CLIGEN in the Loess Plateau. The dataset includes parameter data files for driving CLIGEN and 100-year daily weather data files generated by running CLIGEN from 71 meteorological stations on the Loess Plateau. The 71 sites are distributed in 7 provinces (Shanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Henan, and Qinghai). Each file is individually saved in ASCII format and can be opened for viewing with text programs.\nThis data set is generated based on long-term serial daily meteorological data measured by 71 meteorological stations on the Loess Plateau. Daily meteorological parameters include: precipitation, maximum, minimum, and average temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed and direction. The data comes from the China Meteorological Science Data Sharing Service Network and the Loess Plateau Soil and Water Conservation Database. Among them, solar radiation data is available at only 12 sites on the Loess Plateau. The solar radiation parameters at other sites are generated by kriging space interpolation. The dew point temperature is calculated using the average temperature and relative humidity.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for generating CLIGEN parameter datasets involve using long-term daily meteorological data from 71 stations distributed across seven provinces, focusing on parameters like precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and wind metrics. In contrast, kriging spatial interpolation is used specifically for stations lacking solar radiation data, where interpolated values are generated based on spatial statistics. The direct measurement approach relies on actual weather station data, while kriging uses mathematical models to estimate missing data.",
