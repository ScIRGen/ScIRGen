            "description": "Black carbon is an important light absorbing substance, which has an important impact on climate change. This data set contains the data of black carbon concentration and sedimentation flux in the core of six lakes (gun Yong lake, Tanggula lake, linggecuo, Ranwu lake, gokyo, gosainkunda) on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and the south slope of the Himalayas. The carbon concentration of Huxin black was determined by digestion filtration thermoluminescence method. This dataset is an excel file, which can be opened directly by using Excel. This data set is helpful to study the history of atmospheric black carbon deposition in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas and to further analyze the sources of atmospheric black carbon. It can be used as the basic data for the study of atmospheric black carbon transport and climate effect assessment.",
