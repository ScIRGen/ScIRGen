            "description": "Soil bulk density, porosity, water content, water characteristic curve, saturated hydraulic conductivity, particle analysis, infiltration rate, and sampling point location information in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin.\n1. The data is for 2014 supplementary sampling for 2012, using the ring knife to take the original soil;\n2. The soil bulk density is the dry bulk density of the soil and is measured by the drying method. The original ring-shaped soil sample collected in the field was thermostated at 105 ° C for 24 hours in an oven, and the soil dry weight was divided by the soil volume (100 cubic centimeters) , unit: g/cm 3 .\n3. Soil porosity is obtained according to the relationship between soil bulk density and soil porosity;\n4. Soil infiltration analysis data set, the data is the field experimental measurement data from 2013 to 2014.\n5. The infiltration data is measured by “MINI DISK PORTABLE TENSION INFILTROMETER”, and the approximate saturated hydraulic conductivity under a certain negative pressure is obtained.\n6. Soil particle size data was measured at the Grain Granulation Laboratory of the Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education of Lanzhou University. The measuring instrument is a Malvern laser particle size analyzer MS2000.\n7. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is measured according to the enamel hair self-made instrument of Yi Yanli (2009). The Marioot bottle was used to maintain the head during the experiment; at the same time, the Ks measured at the time was converted to the Ks value at 10 °C for analysis and calculation.\n8. Soil water content data is measured using ECH2O, including 5 layers of soil water content and soil temperature.\n9. The water characteristic curve is measured by the centrifuge method: the undisturbed soil of the ring cutter collected in the field is placed in a centrifuge, and each of the speeds is measured at 0, 310, 980, 1700, 2190, 2770, 3100, 5370, 6930, 8200, 11600. The secondary rotor weight is obtained.",

                "Soil moisture is a key variable in the global energy and water cycle, and is also important in many land surface disciplines such as agriculture, hydrology and environmental sciences. In recent decades, satellite products of soil moisture at large scale have become available via different active and passive microwave remote sensing techniques. Compared with C-band and X-band products, L-band products are much more suitable for the estimation of soil moisture because of their higher soil penetration depth, higher frequency and better vegetation penetration, especially for regions where soil moisture is a controlling factor on land-atmosphere exchanges. Employing both an L-band radar and an L-band radiometer, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched on 31 January 2015. The SMAP mission aims to provide soil moisture estimates in the top 5 cm of soil over the global land area with an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) less than 0.04 m3/m3. However, so far, only a few validations of the SMAP products have been conducted, and almost all of them have been carried out at the core validation sites (CVS). Because observations from the CVS have been used to refine and validate retrieval algorithms, it is important to validate the SMAP products over other regions beyond the CVS."

These uncertainties also result in the “dry bias” of the SMAP products in almost all the evaluations to date.

Soil moisture is an essential variable in hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and ecology. Soil moisture and its dynamic response to rainfall control the interaction among the hydrological processes of precipitation, infiltration, evapotranspiration, runoff, and drainage. The dynamics of soil moisture response to rainfall is still poorly investigated in high mountain areas. Land cover change is known to have a strong influence on soil moisture dynamics after rainfall by altering interception, infiltration, plant water uptake, and evaporation processes. The response regimes under different land covers are particularly poorly understood in data-scarce mountainous areas due to the difficulties of installing and maintaining long-term profile soil moisture monitoring networks with high time resolution."

Therefore, it is essential to accurately map the spatial distribution of different soil texture types at the watershed scale for eco-hydrological studies and water resource management. Field surveys provide the most accurate soil texture data. However, it is difficult and expensive to map the spatial distribution of soil texture by field sampling at point scale. In recent years, remote sensing has become an effective way to obtain soil texture data over large scales. Soil texture types are estimated from field samples and satellite images. However, results that were obtained from remote sensing may contain inaccuracies, thus leading to uncertainties in the estimates based on such techniques. To date, scale expansion methods based on limited field sampling data are the most widely used approaches to map the spatial distribution of soil texture at large scales. Over the past decades, numerous scale expansion methods have been used to infer the spatial distribution of soil texture types at large scales.

                "QuestionCn": "在流域尺度上使用遥感技术绘制土壤质地类型时可能会出现哪些挑战，以及这些挑战与实地调查方法相比如何？",
                "AnswerEn": "Remote sensing techniques for mapping soil texture at the watershed scale can introduce inaccuracies due to the indirect estimation from satellite images, leading to uncertainties. Field surveys, although more accurate, are difficult and costly at large scales. The main challenge with remote sensing is ensuring the precision of soil texture estimation, while field surveys face logistical and financial constraints.",
                "AnswerCn": "遥感技术用于在流域尺度上绘制土壤质地图可能会由于从卫星图像间接估算而引入不准确性，导致不确定性。尽管实地调查更为准确，但在大规模上进行实地调查既困难又昂贵。遥感的主要挑战是确保土壤质地估算的精确性，而实地调查则面临后勤和财务上的限制。",

                "AnswerEn": "Mapping soil texture in such challenging areas often uses scale expansion methods based on limited field sampling data. For instance, methods like kriging or Markov chain models can be applied to infer the spatial distribution of soil texture types, utilizing field samples analyzed using instruments like the Mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer.",
                "AnswerCn": "在这样具有挑战性的地区，土壤质地的映射通常使用基于有限现场采样数据的尺度扩展方法。例如，可以应用克里金法或马尔可夫链模型来推断土壤质地类型的空间分布，利用使用Mastersizer 2000激光衍射粒度分析仪分析的现场样本。",

                "AnswerEn": "Challenges in maintaining these networks include harsh environmental conditions and lack of mobile communication coverage. These are addressed by establishing durable networks with multiple nodes installed at different depths to measure soil moisture and temperature, using robust sensors such as Decagon’s 5TE, and sometimes adapting to data gaps caused by sensor failures or environmental disruptions.",
                "AnswerCn": "维护这些网络的挑战包括恶劣的环境条件和缺乏移动通信覆盖。为了解决这些问题，建立了耐用的网络，在不同深度安装多个节点以测量土壤湿度和温度，使用像Decagon的5TE这样的坚固传感器，有时还需要适应由于传感器故障或环境干扰造成的数据缺口。",

Wireless data transmission is difficult as these areas are not covered by mobile communication networks, leading to data gaps from sensor or battery failures. Additionally, instrument malfunctions and damages from livestock and wildlife can hinder data collection efforts.",
