            "description": "Long term surface soil moisture (SSM) data with stable and consistent quality are critical for global environment and climate change monitoring. L band radiometers onboard the recently lunched Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission can provide the state-of-the-art accuracy SSM, but the short temporal coverage of the data records has limited its applications in long-term studies. While Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) and AMSR2 series provide long term observational records of multi-frequency radiometers (C, X, and K bands). This dataset contains 20 years (2002-present) global spatio-temporal consistent surface soil moisture and will be updated in near-real time . The resolution is 36 km at daily scale, the projection is EASE-Grid2, and the data unit is m3 / m3. This dataset adopts the soil moisture neural network retrieval algorithm developed by Yao et al. (2017,2021). This study transfers the merits of SMAP to AMSR-E/2 through using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in which SMAP standard SSM products serve as training targets with AMSR-E/2 brightness temperature (TB) as input. Finally, long term soil moisture data are output. This dataset can reproduce the spatial and temporal distribution of SMAP soil moisture, with comparable accuracy as SMAP soil moisture product. This dataset also compares well with in situ SSM observations at 14 dense validation networks globally, with accuracy of 5% volumetric water content, and outperforms AMSR-E/2 standard SSM products from JAXA and LPRM. This global observation-driven dataset spans nearly two decades at present, and is extendable though the ongoing AMSR2 and upcoming AMSR3 missions for long-term studies of climate extremes, trends, and decadal variability.",

                "Land surface soil moisture (SM), which is the water stored in the upper soil layer, is a key variable to improve our understanding of the energy and water cycles in the Earth system; thus, it is an important parameter in climate, hydrology, and environment. SM plays a crucial role in a large number of applications, including numerical weather prediction, disaster monitoring, crop yield prediction, flood and drought damage estimation, water resources management, greenhouse gas accounting, civil protection, and epidemiological modeling of water borne diseases. SM, as a key parameter in the water cycle process, has been endorsed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as one of 50 Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), which are required to support the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Both the active and passive microwave remote sensing systems can estimate SM through the observation of backscatter signals and brightness temperatures (TBs), especially passive microwaves at low frequencies. The theoretical basis of microwave remote sensing of soil moisture is that very large differences between the dielectric constants of dry soil and liquid water lead to a very large contrast between wet soil and dry soil. However, these radiometers are easily affected by vegetation attenuation, are insensitive to soil moisture under conditions of moderate vegetation (water content greater than ~3 kg/m2), and measurements can only represent information about the top of 1 cm of soil. L-band has more advantages in the retrieval of soil moisture, because it can penetrate the atmosphere and vegetation coverage (up to ~5 kg/m2 water content), and TB represents information on the upper 5 cm of soil. The NNs method is an effective nonlinear method to establish a model. It has been widely applied in remote sensing fields, including soil moisture retrieval. The general idea is to build relationships between input data (TB/backscatter, SM) and target SMs (in situ SM, model SM, or satellite SM) through NNs training, and then retrieve SM using the trained NNs."

The initial purpose of this study is to find a way to refine the former observations from the future WCOM soil moisture products, which mainly rely on L-S-C band observations. In our study, for comprehensive consideration, we adopted the second solution to rebuild long time series SM products, using a BPNN method with SMOSL3sm products as a reference."

In those areas, the NNs cannot be trained effectively or the NNs training result have a poor relationship between the input and the output, so the soil moisture cannot be retrieved correctly."

The BPNNs on each grid were trained over July 2010–June 2011, and the entire year of 2013, with SMOSL3sm as a training target, and taking the reflectivities (Rs) of the C/X/Ku/Ka/Q bands, and the MVI from AMSR-E/AMSR2 TB data, as input, in which the MVI is used to correct for vegetation effects.
