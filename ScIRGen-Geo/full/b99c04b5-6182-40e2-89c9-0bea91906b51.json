      "description": "The radiogenic isotope composition of strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) on surface of the Earth are a powerful tool for tracing dust sources and sinks on surface of the Earth. To differentiate the spatial variability of aeolian dust sources in key cryospheric regions at the three poles (including the ‘Third Pole’ covering the high mountain area in Asia, the Arctic and Antarctica). A dataset of the Sr-Nd isotopic compositions from the terrestrial extremely cold or arid environments in this study was compiled as the similar method by Blanchet (2019). The database identified on snow, ice, sand, soil (loess) and sediment from the modern dust samples and paleoclimatic records of the three poles based on 43 different references with 967 data points in total. There are 274 data points from the third pole, 302 data points from the Arctic, and 391 data points from Antarctica. The sampling and measurement methods, and quality of these data are recognized and introduced. In each pole, geographical coordinates and other information are provided. The main scientific purpose of this dataset is to provide our own measurement and collect documentation of the Sr-Nd dataset, which will be useful for determining the sources and transport pathways of dust at the three poles and to investigate whether there are multiple dust sources for each of the poles. These datasets provide detail exhaustive documentation of the isotopic signature from the three poles at specific time intervals, which would be useful for understanding the dust source or sink of the three poles.",

        "The role of mineral dust in the Earth system extends well beyond its impact on the energy balance and involves interactions with the carbon cycle and glacier melting on global scales. The isotopic compositions of the radiogenic elements strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) are powerful tools for tracing dust sources and sinks because their characteristics vary significantly on the surface of the Earth (including snow, sand, sediment, loess, and eolian deposits). Therefore, the combination of different isotopic signatures, specifically 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd (expressed as εNd(0)), has proven to be useful in discriminating among different dust source areas in Earth science. The transport of eolian dust from natural desert regions has also been identified in modern snow and ice records at the so-called “third pole” based on Sr–Nd data. However, it is still a controversial issue; for example, recent results have emphasized that eolian dust from local sources contributes significantly to high-mountain glaciers. Additionally, eolian dust from various source regions, including the Saharan Desert in North Africa and the Gobi and Taklimakan deserts in Asia, can be transported to the GrIS, and great uncertainties still exist. The Sr–Nd data from snow layers in the Berkner Island ice sheet in western Antarctica, for most of the year, support scenarios that involve contributions from proximal sources. The Sr–Nd data from insoluble dust in snow samples from East Antarctica indicate that long-distance natural dust primarily originates from Australia and that local dust originates from ice-free areas. The Sr–Nd data from Holocene ice cores from East Antarctica indicate a well-mixed atmospheric background involving a mixture of two or more sources in the Southern Hemisphere. The amount of isotopic information is currently adequate for Patagonian and non-Patagonian mineral dust exported from southern South America (SSA) and the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS). However, Sr–Nd data are unevenly distributed across the entire AIS. Measuring the Sr–Nd isotopic compositions in ice cores from Antarctica is a major challenge. Although considerable Sr–Nd data have been measured, the variations in the characteristics and measurement methods of these data make it necessary to reassess these data on the dust sources in these remote regions."
