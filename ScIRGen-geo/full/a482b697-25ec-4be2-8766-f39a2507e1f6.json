            "description": "This dataset mainly comprises in-situ trace elements (Table 1) and in-situ sulfur isotope data (Table 2) of pyrite in Gouli gold deposit (goluolongwa and Asha gold deposits) in East Kunlun orogenic belt. Part of the trace element analysis of pyrite was completed in the State Key Laboratory of deposit geochemistry, Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using ASI resolution lr-s155 laser microprobe equipped with coherent compex Pro 193 nm ArF excimer laser and Agilent 7700x inductively coupled plasmon mass spectrometer. The other part was tested by compex Pro 102 ARF 193 nm excimer laser and Agilent 7700e inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in Wuhan shangspectral Analysis Technology Co., Ltd. In the treatment of trace element content, glass reference materials NIST 610 and NIST 612 are used for multi external standard and no internal standard correction (Liu et al., 2008). The sulfide reference material MASS-1 of USGS is used as the monitoring standard to verify the reliability of the correction method. The off-line processing of analytical data is completed by the software ICPMSDataCal (Liu et al., 2008). Part of the sulfur isotopic element analysis of pyrite was completed in the State Key Laboratory of deposit geochemistry, Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using Nu-Plasma III multi collector (MC) - ICP-MS equipped with 155arf-193nm laser ablation system. The other part was completed in Wuhan shangspectral Analysis Technology Co., Ltd. by Geolas HD laser ablation Neptune plus multi receiver cup inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). Sulfur isotope mass fractionation was corrected by SSB method. Pyrrhotite reference SP-Po-01（ δ 34sv CDT = 1.4 ± 0.4), pyrite reference material SP-Py-01（ δ 34sv CDT = 2.0 ± 0.5 ‰) was repeatedly analyzed as a quality monitoring sample to verify the accuracy of the experimental method. This dataset has been published in the international authoritative journals ore geology reviews（Li X.H., Fan H.R. *, Liang G.Z., Zhu R.X., Yang K.F., Steele-MacInnis M., Hu H.L. (2021). Texture, trace elements, sulfur and He-Ar isotopes in pyrite: Implication for ore-forming processes and fluid source of the Guoluolongwa gold deposit,East Kunlun metallogenic belt. Ore Geology Reviews 136）and Journal of Asian Earth Sciences（Liang G.Z., Yang K.F. *, Sun W.Q., Fan H.R., Li X.H., Lan T.G., Hu H.L., Chen Y.W. （2021）. Multistage ore-forming processes and metal source recorded in texture and composition of pyrite from the Late Triassic Asiha gold deposit, Eastern Kunlun Orogenic Belt, western China. Journal of Asian Earth Sciences 220.）The main results are as follows: (1) Through the comprehensive study of pyrite structure and geochemistry, the properties and sources of ore-forming fluids and multi-stage ore-forming process of Goluolongwa gold deposit and Asiha gold deposit are discussed. Four types of pyrite with different structure, trace element content and sulfur isotope are distinguished, and four metallogenic stages are divided; (2) The S isotopic characteristics and low Co -Ni content of hydrothermal pyrite in goluolongwa gold deposit and the He-Ar isotopic characteristics of fluid inclusions in pyrite indicate that the ore-forming fluid mainly comes from the multi-stage fluid dissolution of crust derived felsic magma, which is consistent with the results of H-O isotopic analysis and a large number of granites exposed in the east of the East Kunlun orogenic belt; (3) The sulfur isotopic and trace element characteristics of pyrite in Asiha gold deposit indicate that the ore-forming fluids are derived from the recent granite porphyry magmatic hydrothermal solution. During the rising process of fluid in the metallogenic stage, the basic volcanic rock and sedimentary rock surrounding rock are mixed, and the mixing amount shows an increasing trend. The above data systematically explain the characteristics and sources of ore-forming fluid of Gouli gold deposit, finely describe the multi-stage metallogenic process, clarify the metallogenic mechanism, and construct the metallogenic model map, which is of great significance for exploring the exploration and mining of gold resources in the East Kunlun orogenic belt. In addition, this dataset can provide a comparative reference for the study of metallogenic mechanism of other gold deposits in the East Kunlun orogenic belt, and has great scientific value for systematically exploring the formation of gold deposits in the East Kunlun orogenic belt.",

                    "Answer": "The trace element analysis of pyrite in the East Kunlun orogenic belt utilizes laser microprobe techniques with ICP-MS, employing external standard corrections using NIST 610 and NIST 612, and verifying with the MASS-1 standard. Sulfur isotope analysis is conducted using LA-MC-ICP-MS, corrected by the SSB method, with reference materials SP-Po-01 and SP-Py-01 for quality control. These methods ensure reliability and accuracy of results, with the specific standards and calibration techniques used enhancing the precision of the data, which may differ from alternative methods in other studies that might use different equipment, standards, or calibration techniques.",

                    "Answer": "From the trace elements and sulfur isotopes in pyrite, it can be inferred that the Guoluolongwa gold deposit's ore-forming fluids mainly originated from crust-derived felsic magma with multiple fluid exsolution events. Additionally, the characteristics of sulfur isotopes and microelements suggest that the fluid sources at the Asiha gold deposit were from contemporaneous porphyry magmatic hydrothermal systems, with interactions with mafic volcanic and sedimentary wall rocks, indicating a complex, multi-stage ore-forming process.",

                    "Answer": "The precision and reliability of micro-element and sulfur isotope analysis in pyrite are influenced by several factors, including the choice of analytical equipment and methods. For micro-element analysis, the use of laser ablation systems combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is crucial. Calibration with glass standard materials like NIST 610 and NIST 612 is employed for accuracy, while the reliability of calibration methods is verified using sulfide standard materials such as MASS-1. For sulfur isotope analysis, multi-collector ICP-MS systems are used, and sulfur isotope mass fractionation is corrected using the SSB method. Reference materials such as SP-Po-01 and SP-Py-01 are analyzed repeatedly to ensure accuracy. The different stages and sources of ore-forming fluids, detected through variations in pyrite structure, trace elements, and isotopic compositions, also impact the analysis outcomes.",

The findings aim to elucidate the nature and source of the ore-forming fluids and construct a mineralization model, which is important for exploring and exploiting gold resources in the Eastern Kunlun Orogenic Belt.
