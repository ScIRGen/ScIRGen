            "description": "The datasets are the annual mean land surface temperature (MAST) datasets of the Tibetan Plateau from 2003 to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 1km . The annual temperature cycle (ATC) model is selected to reconstruct the temperature in the daily MODIS Terra and Aqua LST products of the Tibetan Plateau. The spatiotemporal seamless MAST datasets of the Tibetan Plateau from 2003 to 2020 is extracted. Based on the MAST of four times of daytime and nighttime estimated by MODIS Terra and Aqua LST products, nine LST time series combinations are constructed to represent the MAST of different time attributes, Specifically. For daytime LST grouping, there are three combinations: Terra daytime MAST (TD), Aqua daytime MAST (AD), Terra daytime MAST and Aqua daytime MAST mean (TAD). LST grouping in the nighttime also includes three combinations: Terra night MAST (TN), Aqua night MAST (AN), Terra night MAST and the mean value of Aqua night MAST (TAN). In addition to the daytime and nighttime LST groups, the third group refers to the daily average which covers the average value of Terra daytime and nighttime MASTs (TDN), the average value of Aqua daytime and nighttime MASTs (ADN), and the average of all Terra and Aqua MASTs (TADN). This data can monitor the temporal and spatial changes of the LST of the Tibetan Plateau, help reveal the impact of climate change on the thermal environment of the Tibetan Plateau, and provide scientific reference for the ecological environment protection and sustainable development of the Tibetan Plateau.",

                "The Tibetan plateau (TP), known as the third pole in the world, plays an important role in global atmospheric action because of its unique topographic features. As the highest plateau in the world, the TP is highly sensitive to climate change, serving as an indicator of global climate change for revealing the changing characteristics and magnitudes. Therefore, many recent efforts have been made to explore the impact of climate change and responses. These studies cover different concerns, including permafrost change, snow cover variation, variation in alpine vegetation, water resource assessment, and desertification. From the above monitoring or change detection, there is a common view that the global warming effect plays a key role. In addition to the use of TA, as a component of surface hydro-thermal energy balance, land surface temperature (LST) is also an important parameter for studying the exchange of matter and energy between the land surface and atmosphere, and it can play a similar role as TA in reflecting the global warming effect. The rapid development of LST estimation algorithms accelerated the application of thermal infrared remote sensing data for LST monitoring. Among the existing thermal infrared remote sensing platforms, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra or Aqua satellite provides a long-term LST product since 2000 and 2002, respectively, showing a significant improvement in both data accuracy and temporal frequency. Some validation studies have demonstrated the good accuracy of MODIS LST estimation with the absolute error ranging from 1.0 K to 3.0 K for different land cover (LC) types."

            "challenges": [
                "The sparse distribution (especially for the northwestern part of the plateau) of meteorological stations hampers a quantitative view about surface warming trend over the whole plateau. Although the MODIS 8-Day or monthly LST product can partly alleviate the cloud influence through temporal aggregation, the poor temporal resolution of these data cannot represent the high temporal variation in LST. Consequently, these problems affected the monitoring of regional LST changes and increased difficulties to accurately understand the impact of climate change."

To weaken the influence of cloud cover, an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model was utilized to extract the mean annual surface temperature (MAST) with the MODIS/Terra daily LST product. With time series of MAST, the geodetector (GED) was introduced to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of LST and explore its key impacting factors. Additionally, the Mann–Kendall (MK) trend analysis method was applied to the MASTs to obtain the MAST trend from 2000 to 2018 and reveal the temporal change pattern."

Areas ranging from 4500 to 5000 m exhibited the strongest warming effect. The controlling effects of these factors were generally stronger in the nighttime than those in the daytime, and elevation was the most important factor with the contribution scores of 27.12% and 62.98% in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. In addition, the analysis revealed that the temporal changes of LST were mainly caused by surface properties (vegetation, snow cover, and water surface area) changes, radiant flux changes induced by cloud amount changes, and climate warming."
