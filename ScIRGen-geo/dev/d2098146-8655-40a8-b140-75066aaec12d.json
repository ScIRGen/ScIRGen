            "description": "The dataset of TIR spectral emissivity was obtained in the arid region hydrology experiment area and A'rou foci experiment area. Observations were by:\n     (1) Spectral emissivity obtained from 102F at 2-25um in cooperation with the handheld infrared thermometer (BNU) for the surface radiative temperature and one au-plating board for downward atmospheric radiation. The radiative transfer equation and TES methods were applied to retrieve emissivity.\n     The grassland and the concrete floor were measured on May, 27, 2008, the wheat field and the maize field at ICBC resort on May, 29, 2008, the concrete floor (multiangle measurements) at ICBC resort on Jun. 3, 2008, the bare soil and the maize leaf in Yingke oasis maize field on Jun. 22, 2008, the maize and wheat canopy in Yingke oasis maize field on Jun. 23, 2008, the rape field in Biandukou experimental area on Jun. 24, 2008, the alfalfa, the saline land, the grassland and the barley land on Jun. 26, 2008, the wheat field and the maize field in Yingke oasis maize field on Jun. 29, 2008, the desert bare land and vegetation (Reaumuria soongorica) in No. 2 Huazhaiai desert plot on Jun. 30, 2008,  the rape field and the grassland in Biandukou experimental area on Jul. 6, 2008, and the grassland and the bare land (multiangle) in A'rou experimental area on Jul. 14, 2008.\n     The cold blackbody calibration (*.CBX/*.CBB), the warm blackbody calibration (*.WBX/*.WBB), the ground objects measurements (*.SAX), au-plating board measurements, and the downward atmospheric radiation (*.DWX) were all needed during observation. Moreover, the spectral radiance and emissivity were also archived.\n     The response function of various bands could be acquired by 102F. And then emissivity of 2-25um could be retrieved. Two results of emissivity were developed: one was direct from 102F and the other was retrieved by ISSTES (Iterative spectrally smooth temperature-emissivity separation). Spectral resolution for raw data and proprecessed data was 4cm-1.\n     (2) Spectral emissivity obtained from BOMAN at 2 -13μm in cooperation with the blackbody barrel and the blackbody from Institute of Remote Sensing Applications and the blackbody (BNU).\n     The desert was measured on Jun. 30 and Jul. 1, 2008, A'rou foci experimental area on Jul. 14, 2008, indoor observations on the deep and shallow layer soil, vegetation, small stones, two maize plants from Yingke No.2 (YKYZYMD02) field and one maize plant and bare land from No. 3 (YKYZYMD03)field on on Jul. 16, 2008, Linze experimental area on Jul. 17, 2008, and gobi on Jul. 18, 2008. The sample site, coordinates, time and photos were all archived.\n     During each observation, BOMAN was preheated and the blackbody was set at the predicted target temperature, which would be changed after the infrared radiation of the blackbody was measured by BOMAN. And then the target infrared radiation, the downward atmospheric radiation (reflected by the au-plating board) and the infrared radiation of the blackbody would be measured one by one. Raw data were archived in Igm, and after processed by FTSW500, the result was Rad (radiation). Finally, Rad would be changed into txt files by Matlab programs.",

The BOMAN spectrometer also relies on black body calibration but focuses on different temperature ranges and uses the FTSW500 software for data processing, converting Rad values to text files. Both methods involve specific steps for calibration and data conversion, but differ in the spectral range and software used for data processing.",

                    "Answer": "The use of infrared spectrometers, such as the 102F and BOMAN, allows researchers to measure emissivity based on radiation transfer equations and TES algorithms. By combining these measurements with data from handheld infrared thermometers and thermal imagers, it is possible to infer the physical temperature of objects. This method involves taking measurements at specific locations and times, using calibration files (cold and warm blackbody), and considering factors like atmospheric downwelling radiation. Such data processing allows researchers to interpret the physical properties of landscapes like grasslands, deserts, and agricultural fields by analyzing their spectral emissivity and radiation characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "The need for multiple calibration files, such as cold and warm black body files, in infrared spectrometry data collection methods is primarily due to the necessity of accurately calibrating the instrument's response across different wavebands. This ensures that the measurements of the target's radiance and emissivity are precise, which is crucial for obtaining reliable physical temperature readings of the observed surfaces. Calibration with different temperature bodies helps in correcting any biases in the instrument's measurements by providing reference points that span the range of expected target temperatures.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using the infrared spectrometer to measure the emissivity data of ground objects based on the radiative transfer equation and TES algorithm. The procedure includes calibrating with cold and warm blackbody files, measuring ground objects, and recording downwelling atmospheric radiation with a gold-coated plate. Preprocessing involves calibrating the spectrometer with the blackbody measurements to obtain response functions across wavelengths. The data is then processed to derive spectral emissivity using both the instrument's algorithm and ISSTES algorithm, if data files are complete.",
