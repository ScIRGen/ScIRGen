            "description": "Aiming at the lack of sub-daily precipitation data in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), this study established a method to quantify the temporal scaling characteristic of sub-daily precipitation and the associated uncertainty, which leads to a set of functions with six key parameters. Importantly, the six parameters are found to be closely linked to geographical conditions, enabling a high-resolution gridded (1km×1km) parameters data set. This data set can be utilized to quantitatively describe the probabilistic distribution and extract key information about maximum precipitation duration (from 1 to 12 hour), which provides an effective way to estimate sub-daily precipitation and its uncertainty, as a necessary support for rainstorm-related natural disasters study in QTP.",

By analyzing observational rainfall data from 102 stations from 1951 to 2018 during May to September, the dataset aims to establish methods for estimating short-duration rainfall characteristics and quantifying uncertainties. This is crucial for assessing the maximum daily rainfall over 1 to 12 hours and its uncertainties, significantly contributing to the development of flash flood disaster forecasting, early warning systems, and disaster prevention and mitigation in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "To establish a dataset for short-duration rainfall characteristics in regions with scarce data like the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, one can utilize historical observational data from multiple stations, in this case, 102 stations from 1951 to 2018, focusing on the months of May to September. The process involves developing estimation methods for short-duration rainfall characteristics and quantifying uncertainty using parameters such as a_mean, b_mean, a_cv, b_cv, a_cs, and b_cs. This approach provides spatial coverage at a resolution of 1km×1km, essential for supporting flood disaster warning systems and disaster management.",
