            "description": "The data contents are stored in three excel tables: Table 1: characteristics of typical skarn Cu Au polymetallic deposits in Tongling area; table 2: characteristics of representative Cu (AU) deposits in Fenghuangshan orefield; Table 3 main characteristics, pyrite and chalcopyrite types, pyrite and chalcopyrite structure of Fenghuangshan and baoshandao deposits in each metallogenic stage. Table 1 summarizes the previous research results of typical skarn Cu Au polymetallic deposits in Tongling area. The characteristics of representative copper (gold) deposits in Fenghuangshan ore field are summarized in Table 2. The skarn deposits in Fenghuangshan area are mainly small and medium-sized deposits with copper reserves of about 600000 tons. The skarn stage is mainly composed of garnet, diopside and a small amount of wollastonite, actinolite, chlorite, epidote, magnetite, pyrite and chalcopyrite. The three tables summarize the previous studies and provide a basis for the future study of skarn deposits in Tongling and Fenghuangshan areas.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored in Excel.",

                    "Answer": "The characterization of sulfide minerals in skarn copper (gold) deposits is influenced by the comprehensive analysis of mineral types and structures compiled from three Excel tables. Table 1 summarizes previous research on typical skarn copper-gold polymetallic deposits in the Tongling area. Table 2 organizes the characteristics of representative copper (gold) deposits in the Fenghuangshan mining field, noting that the skarn deposits are mainly medium to small-sized with a copper reserve of about 600,000 tons. Table 3 details the mineralization stages of deposits in the Fenghuangshan and Baoshan Island areas, focusing on the skarn stage composed of garnet, diopside, and smaller amounts of other minerals. This structured data collection provides a reliable basis for future research in the Tongling and Fenghuangshan areas.",

This can facilitate the identification of common mineralogical and structural patterns, enhance predictive modeling for mineral exploration, and contribute to the development of more efficient mining strategies. Such a dataset can also serve as a valuable reference for future research aimed at uncovering more about skarn-related mineral deposits.",
