            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Dashalong station eddy covariance system (EC) in the upperstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2018. The site (98.9406° E, 38.8399° N) was located in the Qilian County in Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3739 m. The EC was installed at a height of 4.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500RS) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. Data during September 27 to November 14, 2018 were missing due to the sensor calibration of sonic anemometer.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "The quality assessment levels of flux measurements suggest challenges in maintaining data accuracy, such as equipment malfunctions, environmental conditions like precipitation, and data processing issues like missing values. The classification into nine quality levels indicates a rigorous approach to evaluating data reliability, reflecting the complexities of field data collection in high-altitude, marshy meadow environments.",

                    "Answer": "Data quality issues in eddy covariance measurements may arise from instrument errors, adverse weather conditions such as precipitation, and missing data during specific time periods. These issues are addressed through data processing steps like outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and virtual temperature correction. Furthermore, data is quality evaluated based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity tests, and specific data is discarded when instruments malfunction or during rainfall. The dataset also uses a quality coding system to denote data reliability, ranging from high to poor quality.",

                    "Answer": "Using a 30-minute average period for data processing can result in more stable and reliable measurements of surface processes, as it helps to smooth out short-term fluctuations and noise inherent in high-frequency (10Hz) data. However, it may also lead to a loss of finer temporal details, potentially overlooking rapid changes or events that occur within shorter time frames. The choice of this averaging period balances data reliability with temporal resolution, optimizing the quality of flux measurements while maintaining a manageable dataset size.",

                    "Answer": "The data from an eddy covariance system is preprocessed using Eddypro software, with steps including outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation (double coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. Quality evaluation is conducted on flux values based on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data is also filtered by removing erroneous instrument readings, data from one hour before and after precipitation, and data where the 10Hz raw data has more than 10% missing per 30-minute interval.",

These techniques are applied to the raw 10Hz data using Eddypro software to produce quality-assessed 30-minute datasets.",
