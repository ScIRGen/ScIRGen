            "description": "The dataset contains all individual glacial storage (unit: km3) over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in 1970s and 2000s. It is sourced from the resultant data of the paper entitled \"Consolidating the Randolph Glacier Inventory and the Glacier Inventory of China over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Investigating Glacier Changes Since the mid-20th Century\". The first draft of this paper has been completed and is planned to be submitted to Earth System Science Data journal. The baseline glacier inventories in 1970s and 2000s are the Randolph Glacier Inventory 4.0 dataset, and the Glacier Inventory of China, respectively. Based on the individual glacial boundaries extracted from the above-mentioned two datasets, the grid-based bedrock elevation dataset (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html, DOI: 10.7289/v5c8276m), and the glacier surface elevation obtained by a slope-dependent method, the individual glacier volumes in 1970s and 2000s are then calculated. In addition, the calculated results of individual glacier volumes in this study have been compared and verified with the existent results of several glacier volumes, relevant remote sensing datasets, and the global glacier thickness dataset based on the average of multiple glacier model outputs (https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/315707, doi:10.3929/ethz-b-000315707), and the errors in the calculations have also been quantified. The established dataset in this study is expected to provide the data basis for the future regional water resources estimation and glacier ablation-involved researches. Moreover, the acquisition of the data also provides a new idea for the future glacier storage estimation.",

It captures detailed desertification attributes like sand dune types and vegetation density through specific attribute fields, including the degree of desertification, shapes of sandy areas, grassland, woodland, woodland density, and farmland. This format is effective for spatial analysis and visualization, but its comparison to other geospatial data formats would focus on aspects like data interoperability, storage capacity, and ease of integration with other geographic information systems.",

Additionally, the absence of certain modern data layers and geographic information systems (GIS) tools during that era could contribute to difficulties in translating historical data into digitized formats.",

                    "Answer": "The digitization process involves converting physical map data into a digital format, typically by scanning the map and using GIS software to trace and encode the various features. The ESRI Shapefile format is utilized for storing spatial data and its attributes, which in this case include layers such as desertification maps, rivers, marshes, roads, lakes, and residential areas. Attributes specific to desertification, such as Type, Shapes, Grassland, Woodland, W_density, and Farmland, are stored in the shapefile's attribute table. The use of a specific projection system, such as Datum D_Beijing_1954 and Spheroid Krasovsky_1940, ensures accurate spatial representation and analysis.",
