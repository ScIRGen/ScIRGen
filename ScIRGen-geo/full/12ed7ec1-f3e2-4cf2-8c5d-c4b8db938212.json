            "description": "This data is the whole rock stable Fe isotope data of magmatic rocks. Samples were collected from Neoproterozoic diorite and gabbro in Tongde area, western margin of the Yangtze Block, South China. The chemical treatment of Fe isotopes was completed in the State Key Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Total procedural blank is 25ng, and the recovery is higher than 99%. The data were analyzed by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) with an error (2σ) less than 0.06‰. The obtained data can constrain the magma evolution process of Neoproterozoic Tongde pluton and provide new constraints for the Fe isotope fractionation mechanism of mafic-intermediate rocks.",

This method minimizes contamination and maximizes the amount of isotopic signal collected, leading to precise measurements of Fe isotopes.
