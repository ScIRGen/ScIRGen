At present, this data has been applied to a number of studies. For example, based on this data set, provincial power data and catchment water resources data, a set of China's coal-fired power unit data set with spatial geography and water intake information has been constructed, and the heterogeneity of water intake demand of coal-fired power units and coal-fired power and water pressure in 2015 have been analyzed, so as to provide a basis for the subsequent formulation of China's provincial-level coal-fired power transformation path under the future multi scenario goals Identify the water pressure risk of coal-fired power development on the scale of water resources basin, and lay a foundation for research.",

                "Globally, the power industry is the key sector producing the most greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the second-largest water use sector after agriculture, with the cooling water demand of coal-fired power plants accounting for the vast majority of the total water demand. The existing power plants in many parts of the world, including Europe, USA, and China, have significant impacts on water resources and may be affected by the changes of water resources in the future. During the past several years, the coal power capacity and generation in China have increased by 66.4% and 43.6%, respectively, from 2010 to 2020, and there are also ambitious power development plans in certain Chinese provinces. Moreover, the carbon emissions originating from coal power generation are increasing, and water withdrawal for coal power generation has caused water scarcity issues in some certain areas because of the unbalanced water resource supply and demand in China. China has vigorously promoted many advanced coal power generation techniques, such as high-capacity and high-efficiency coal-fired power units and air cooling technologies, which has achieved remarkable effects. Hence, there has been a freshwater withdrawal decoupling trend from coal-fired power generation growth in China during the past 15 years (2000 – 2015), which has prevented a major increase in the amount of water withdrawal in the Chinese coal power generation industry. China has joined the Paris Agreement and committed to carbon emission reduction targets. China has also pledged to try to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 at the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2020 and issued plans to promote carbon emission reduction actions, such as the 14th Five-Year Plan, which are very likely to change the future development trend of coal power in China."

This study reveals the strong synergies between reducing carbon emissions and alleviating water stress risk in China’s power sector, but regional risk should be noted while achieving the carbon reduction targets."

            "challenges": [
                "However, these studies have usually been carried out at administrative scales in China or other countries, and the coarse spatial accuracy is not consistent with the real catchment-level distribution pattern of water resources. Therefore, the water stress in certain catchments have been likely ignored or the irreversibly high local risks of water resources have been omitted. Moreover, it is challenging to reveal the impacts of the above indirect factors on water resources. In other words, there exists a gap between the administrative management of power development pathways and the geographical changes of water resources."

The bottom-up model of China’s power industry (Multiregional model for Energy Supply system and their Environmental Impacts, or MESEIC) is employed to simulate the total amount and layout changes in China’s coal-fired power sector under multiple socioeconomic development pathways and carbon emission reduction targets. We build a coal-fired power unit dataset that provides the potential locations of future coal-fired power plants. This study adopts the Monte Carlo method to determine the probability spatial distribution of plants. We established a dataset of the coal-fired power units in China by integrating different data sources, which contains more than 7,800 units (including retired, operational, and planned units) and covers more than 98% of the total operational capacity in 2015."

                "Results show that the future power supply mix varies much under the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and carbon emission targets. Without carbon emission targets, coal power would continue to dominate the power supply mix advantage and would cause severe risk of water stress. Under SSP1-5, the national water withdrawal from coal power in 2050 would be 12.2 – 176.2 billion m3 under the reference scenario, but would decline to 10.7 – 59.2 billion m3 with 2 ℃ target and 0.11 – 35.5 billion m3 with 1.5 ℃ target. Compared with the 2 ℃ target, the catchment-level water stress risk generated by coal-fired power plants in north China would be significantly reduced under the stricter target of 1.5 ℃. However, the benefits would be reduced under SSP5 because of the application of carbon capture and storage."
