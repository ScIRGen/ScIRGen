            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of A’rou Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2019. The site (100.464° E, 38.047° N) was located on a cold grassland surface in the Caodaban village, A’rou Town, Qilian County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3033 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45C; 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 25 m, towards north), wind speed profile (010C; 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 25 m, towards north), wind direction profile (020C; 2 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 5 m, towards south), four-component radiometer (CNR4; 5 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 5 m, towards south, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR-LITE; 5 m, towards south, vertically upward), soil heat flux (HFP01SC; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m, 2 m in the south of tower), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (TCAV; -0.02, -0.04 m, 2 m in the south of tower), soil temperature profile (109; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.06, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2, -2.4, -2.8 and -3.2 m, 3 duplicates in -0.04 m and -0.1 m), and soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.06, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8, -1.2, -1.6, -2, -2.4, -2.8 and -3.2 m, 3 duplicates in -0.04 m and -0.1 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_1 m, Ta_2 m, Ta_5 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m and Ta_25 m; RH_1 m, RH_2 m, RH_5 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m and RH_25 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_1 m, Ws_2 m, Ws_5 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m and Ws_25 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_2 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (μmol/(s m-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm_1, Ts_4 cm_2, Ts_4 cm_3, Ts_6 cm, Ts_10 cm_1, Ts_10 cm_2, Ts_10 cm_3, Ts_15 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_30 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_60 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, Ts_160 cm, Ts_200 cm, Ts_240 cm, Ts_280 cm and Ts_320 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm_1, Ms_4 cm_2, Ms_4 cm_3, Ms_6 cm, Ms_10 cm_1, Ms_10 cm_2, Ms_10 cm_3, Ms_15 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_30 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_60 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, Ms_160 cm, Ms_200 cm, Ms_240 cm, Ms_280 cm and Ms_320 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The soil heat flux was missing during January 1 to 19 because of broken of the sensor line; Soil heat flux (G2) were wrong during July to August. The soil moisture and temperature data were missing during September 3 to October 27 due the data logger malfunction. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2019-9-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) and Che et al.

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
                "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
                "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime. The ground-based measurement data were applied to partition ET into E and T applying the Craig–Gordon model.",

In addition, the soil and canopy sensible heat fluxes were estimated using the series TSEB model, and their latent heat fluxes were calculated while solving the energy balance equations (1) and (2), respectively. The soil and canopy component temperatures were calculated using the images obtained with the thermal camera. To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities. Next, the simulated radiometric temperatures were validated against the surface radiometric temperatures, which were calculated according to the incoming long-wave radiation observed by the four-component radiometer."

In parallel, recent climate change, human activities, and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. Water resources in the alpine region are headwaters that need to be regulated to sustain downstream ecosystems. However, perturbations induced by nature/climate change and human activities in recent years have significantly reformed hydrological processes and eco-functions. Accurate estimation and prediction of hydrological processes and their key impact factors has since become crucial.",
                "Unfortunately, the scarcity of observation data in the alpine region, due to the difficulties of access and technological barriers, has hindered alpine hydrological modeling and associated research yet motivated the development of next-generation ecosystem observation networks and experiments. In comparison with the observations, using remote sensing data combined with data assimilation could improve the prediction of hydrological processes. However, due to the complexities of the earth system, there exist various sources of uncertainties in remote sensing data (especially in the alpine region), which have to be validated and calibrated. In summary, to fill the knowledge gap and promote alpine region hydrology research, an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation dataset is essential and expected to provide accurate forcing data for hydrological modeling, validate remote sensing data, allow the evaluation of distributed models and ultimately improve a predictive understanding of alpine hydrological processes and ecosystem functions. In alpine hydrology, in addition to consistent hydrometeorological data obtained from distributed meteorological stations, snow cover and frozen ground are two important indexes and driving forces that manipulate hydrological processes. The maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) before ablation determines the storage of snowmelt – a major source of freshwater in the alpine region, while freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) and soil moisture within the active layer alter water infiltration and, consequently, surface runoff and groundwater. To promote alpine hydrology research, the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (INARCH) was launched in 2015 by the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), involving 18 catchments around the world. The INARCH has since connected individual observatories into an international network and data-share platform to lead frontier research on alpine region hydrometeorology and snow observation. Another community-based observation network, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, was initiated in the early 1990s to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China and is known for its heterogeneous landscapes, diverse ecosystems, unique geographical characteristics and climate change over recent decades. As a major component of the ecohydrological processes in the arid/semi-arid HRB, the alpine hydrological processes, especially those related to snow cover and frozen ground in the upper reaches, have great impacts on runoff in the mountainous region, which then regulate agricultural development in the middle reaches and the ecosystems of the lower reaches.",

Snow cover is widely distributed with unique characteristics in the study area. In the high-altitude mountainous region (elevation > 3800 m), influenced by the local microclimate and low temperature, snowfall could occur in any season. Temporary snow is the major snow cover type in the region at middle and low elevations because strong solar radiation and high air temperature lead to fast melting and sublimation of the snow. Drifting snow is also commonly observed in the region, which may lead to the redistribution of snowpack in high elevation regions (Essery et al., 1999; Li et al., 2014).",

At the sub-basin scale, small-scale observations and measurements focus on data such as precipitation, soil temperature and moisture, which are used to develop and improve hydrologic models, as well as to validate remote sensing products at medium to coarse resolutions (Jin et al., 2014). At the two superstations for snow cover and frozen ground observations, remote sensing products can be further validated using fine-resolution data. In total, seven AMSs, as well as the frozen ground and snow superstations (also incorporating meteorological observations), were established in the study area during the intensive observation period (IOP: 2013 -2014) to obtain the spatially distributed meteorological variables.

At the sub-basin scale, a wireless sensor network (WSN) with 40 nodes was established to capture seasonal changes in soil temperature and moisture. At the A’rou frozen ground superstation, soil temperature and moisture profiles were intensively measured in eighteen layers to a depth of 3.2 m (in a nested pattern with more layers in the topsoil) to obtain the soil hydrothermal features under freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs).

                "Accurate monitoring of surface fluxes over land surfaces is necessary for global climate change research, ecological environment management, and agricultural and water resource planning. The magnitude of the surface flux is largely determined by vegetation parameters, soil moisture and other states of the land surface. The major methods used for estimating surface fluxes are field measurement, remote-sensing-based methods, and land surface modeling. The variability in field measurements of surface flux has been documented over diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales.",
                "Land surface models have been rapidly developed to predict surface fluxes on continuous spatial and temporal scales with physical constraints. Regardless of their specific model structures, all land surface models require observational data to calibrate their parameters and adjust their states. New techniques such as data assimilation are needed to integrate either field or remotely sensed observations with the models, thus improving model accuracy by correcting the model state variables and parameters. Data assimilation has played an increasingly important role in improving predictions of such land surface state variables as the leaf area index, soil temperature profile, soil moisture profile, and other related variables, e.g., surface fluxes.",
                "Spatially distributed estimates of surface flux can be obtained from remote-sensing-based methods. The surface fluxes also can be obtained based on variational techniques and relatively simple models with the assimilation of field-measured land surface temperatures. In a land surface model, the sensible and latent heat fluxes are diagnostic variables, and they are affected by many factors (e.g., model states and parameters). As a new-generation Chinese polar orbiting meteorological satellite, the FY-3 series consists of two experimental (FY-3A/B) and at least four operational satellites (FY-3C/D/E/F). The FY-3 series is expected to have a service life that lasts until 2020. The FY-3A was launched in the year 2008. Visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR) is one of the 11 sensors mounted on the FY-3A satellite and has a nominal spatial resolution of approximately 1 km×1 km at the nadir. The common land model (CoLM) is a state-of-the-art model developed by many groups and validated with extensive field data sites. In CoLM, soil moisture is important for dividing the net radiation into the ground heat, sensible, and latent heat fluxes.",
                "Inaccurate surface flux predictions are highly correlated with errors in land surface temperature estimates. Generally, the diurnal variation trends of the land surface temperature and surface flux can be predicted correctly using the CoLM. The daily averaged evaporation fraction (EF, ratio between latent heat flux and available energy) can be used to describe the splitting of available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes. The LAS instrument can measure the sensible heat flux at a larger scale than the EC system."

The deviations between the FY3A-VIRR LST data and the ground measurements are determined by many factors. The terrain effect can affect the accuracy of the FY3A-VIRR LST retrievals. The mismatch of the spatial and temporal scales between the FY3A-VIRR and field-measured LST can also cause these biases.",
                "The differences between the sensible heat fluxes measured by the EC and LAS system are primarily caused by the energy imbalance of the EC, the heterogeneity of the underlying surfaces, and the differences between the source areas of the EC and LAS measurements. Because of the short memory of the land surface temperature, it is difficult to assimilate the land surface temperatures.
