            "description": "Greenland digital elevation models (DEMs) are indispensable to fieldwork, ice velocity calculations, and mass change estimations. Previous DEMs have provided reasonable estimations for the entire Greenland, but the time span of applied source data may lead to mass change estimation bias. To provide a DEM with a specific time-stamp, we applied approximately 5.8×108 ICESat-2 observations from November 2018 to November 2019 to generate a new DEM, including the ice sheet and glaciers in peripheral Greenland. A spatiotemporal model fit process was performed at 500 m, 1,2, and 5 km grid cells separately, and the final DEM was posted at the modal resolution of 500 m. A total of 98% of the grids were obtained by the model fit, and the remaining DEM gaps were estimated via the ordinary Kriging interpolation method. Compared with IceBridge mission data acquired by the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) Lidar system, the ICESat-2 DEM was estimated to have a maximum median difference of -0.48 m. The performance of the grids obtained by model fit and interpolation was similar, which both agreed well with the IceBridge data. DEM uncertainty rises in regions of low latitude and high slope or roughness. Furthermore, the ICESat-2 DEM showed significant accuracy improvements compared with other altimeter-derived DEMs, and the accuracy was comparable to those derived from stereo-photogrammetry and interferometry. Overall, the ICESat-2 DEM showed excellent accuracy stability under various topographic conditions, which can provide a specific time-stamped DEM with high accuracy that will be useful to study Greenland elevation and mass balance changes.",

                "Greenland's digital elevation model (DEM) is particularly important for fieldwork planning and numerical modeling verification. The ice deformation rate and the underlying bedrock condition can be measured with ice thickness data, which is useful to determine subglacial hydrological pathways. The surface elevation at different periods is also indispensable for studying elevation and mass changes to understand ice dynamics and estimate potential sea level changes. The currently available DEMs of all of Greenland include those based on stereophotogrammetry, altimeters, and interferometry. ICESat-2, with a new generation satellite-borne lidar altimeter, is intended as a successor to the ICESat mission to quantify the contribution of polar ice sheets to sea level rise and the impact of climate change. ICESat-2 has an orbital altitude of 500 km and an orbital inclination of 92°, including a revisit period of 91 days, and can provide centimeter-scale measurements of different surface types. The ICESat-2 beam footprint of approximately 17 m with a spatial interval of 0.7 m ensures accurate elevation measurements at a high orbital resolution by determining the local ice sheet slope. The accuracy in the flat ice sheet can reach 3 cm, and it can still be less than 14 cm even for complex topography, which makes ICESat-2 a great data source to generate a DEM with high resolution and accuracy."
