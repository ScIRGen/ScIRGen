The processing method is as follows:\n(1) Due to the large amount of cloud and shadow noise in the original image, this study uses IDL language to develop and form a special denoising and information completion program for satellite images in cloudy mountainous areas.\n(2) The emmetropia correction image is used as the left image and the front view correction image is the right image. Envi is used for DSM production.\n(3) Using aster-dem data with 30 m resolution, at least 4 typical ground control points are selected for geographic correction to ensure that the geographic coordinate error is in the order of 1 \".\n(4) Cross entropy, root mean square error and area error information entropy are used as accuracy evaluation indexes. Compared with the DSM obtained from the original data, it is verified that the imaging accuracy of the processed DSM is improved.",

                "Regional climatic conditions are a primary determinant of agricultural productivity. Changes in temperature and precipitation will result in changes in land and water regimes that may subsequently affect agricultural productivity. Over the past century, China has experienced substantial climate change: during the past 100 years, the annual average temperature has increased by 0.5–0.8 °C and the distribution of precipitation has become more uneven. Agriculture in China is a major industry, supporting over 20% of the world’s population with only 8% of global cultivated area, and it is also a major importer of feed grains in the world market. Climatic-gridded datasets, generated from the interpolation of observations, express the distribution of climate over space, and they are widely used in global and regional climate change research. Air temperature and precipitation are the most important basic elements in climatic research. Commonly used global monthly climatic datasets, such as those with 0.5° resolution produced by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia in the UK, and by the Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have been used to analyze the modern spatial climatic characteristics of China. However, in the case of these global datasets, climatic observations in only ~200 sites were used for interpolation across the complex terrain of China, and therefore significant biases occur over much of the country. However, the coarse spatial resolution of the CMA dataset makes it difficult to determine the relationship between climate change and agriculture on a regional scale, and in addition, climate regimes in mountainous areas are not captured with sufficient precision."

The dataset, named LZU0025, was designed by Lanzhou University and used a partial thin plate smoothing method embedded in the ANUSPLIN software. To assess the accuracy of the new updated LZU0025, several published and widely used monthly air temperature and precipitation products were used for comparisons. Thin plate spline interpolation is well-suited for the interpolation of monthly air temperature and precipitation datasets. Besides using surface diagnostic (e.g., RTGCV) to assess the accuracy of interpolation model, residuals from stations withheld from the interpolation were examined. Considering approximate 1/3 of the size of dataset as withheld data, 700 air temperature and precipitation stations were selected by using SELNOT program in the ANUSPLIN package. The Taylor diagram is an effective way of graphically illustrating how closely a set of patterns match observation in a single graph and has been used to assess the performance of atmospheric model simulations."
