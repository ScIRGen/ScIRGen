            "description": "The State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences was entrusted to test the SR nd Pb isotope of representative samples of host rock of luokuidong molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island. The test instrument was VG-354 multi receiver plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). In SR Nd isotopic analysis, the sample powder was dissolved with HF + HNO3 in a PTFE cup, and then Sr and REE were separated by cation resin exchange column, and Nd was extracted from REE. The normalized constants 86Sr / 88Sr and 146nd / 144Nd ratios used to correct Sr and nd mass fractionation are 86Sr / 88Sr = 0.1194 and 146nd / 144Nd = 0.7219, respectively. The isotopic ratios of NIST NBS 987 and shin Etsu jndi-1 are 87Sr / 86Sr = 0.710246, respectively ± 17（2 σ， N = 12) and 143Nd / 144Nd = 0.512105 ± 10（2 σ， n=12）。 The accuracy of Sr and Nd isotope analysis is higher than 0.002%. The isotope ratios of 206Pb / 204Pb of jb-3, bcr-2 and jg-1a were 18.286pb/204pb, respectively ± 0、18.763 ± 655 1 and 18 ± 2（2 σ， The ratio of 207Pb / 204Pb is 15.537 ± 1、15.615 ± 608 1 and 15 ± 2（2 σ， The ratio of 208Pb / 204Pb is 38.242, respectively ± 2、38.712 ± 677 4 and 38 ± 6（2 σ， (n = 4) to correct the fractionation in the determination of Pb isotope in batch samples. The ratios of 87Rb / 86Sr and 147sm / 144Nd were calculated according to the contents of Rb, Sr, SM and Nd, and the ratios of 87Sr / 86Sr and 143Nd / 144Nd. The initial 87Sr / 86Sr (ISR) is calculated with RB decay constant of 0 λ Rb=1.42 × 10−11 a−1。 Initial (143Nd / 144Nd) I ε Nd (T) is calculated with SM decay constant of 0 λ Sm=6.54 × 10 − 12a − 1 and 143Nd / 144Nd = 0.512 638 and 147sm / 144Nd = 0.1967 for chondrites. The single-stage depleted mantle model age (tdm1 (nd)) of Nd is calculated using 143Nd / 144Nd = 0.51315 and 147sm / 144Nd = 0.2137 of depleted mantle; The two-stage depleted mantle model age (tdm2 (nd)) is calculated according to DePaolo and Wasserburg (1979). The ratios of 238U / 204Pb, 235U / 204Pb and 232Th / 204Pb were calculated according to the contents of u, th and Pb in samples and the measured values of 208Pb / 204Pb, 207Pb / 204Pb and 206Pb / 204Pb. The initial values of Pb isotopes (208Pb / 204Pb) I, (207Pb / 204Pb) I and (206Pb / 204Pb) I were calculated using a two-stage evolution model.\nMetal sulfide comes from ore samples, which are crushed to 40 ~ 60 mesh without pollution, and then molybdenite and pyrite single mineral particles are selected one by one under the solid microscope to ensure the purity of more than 99%. Metal S-Pb isotope analysis and testing are completed in the analysis and testing research center of Beijing Institute of geology of nuclear industry. Among them, Delta V plus gas isotope mass spectrometer is used for S isotope test, and the detection method and basis are DZ / T 0184.14-1997 determination of sulfur isotope composition in sulfides. The measurement results are based on the Vienna meteorite pyrite (v-cdt, its δ 34S ‰ = 0) δ 34sv-cdt, analysis accuracy is better than ± 0.2‰。 The reference standards of sulfide are gbw-04414 and gbw-04415 silver sulfide standards δ 34S were − 0.07 ± 13 ‰ and 22. 15 ‰ ± 0.14‰。 The instruments used for Pb isotope test are isoprobe-t thermal surface ionization mass spectrometer and Phoenix thermal surface ionization mass spectrometer. The detection method and basis are DZ / T 0184.12-1997 determination of trace lead isotopic composition in rocks and minerals. The common lead standard is NBS 981. The uncorrected result: 208Pb / 206Pb = 2.164 940 ± 15，207Pb/206Pb=0.914 338 ± 7，204Pb/206Pb=0.0591 107 ± 2. The background Pb of the whole process was less than 100 PG. The test result is expressed as: result (2) σ）。\n This data can provide data support for geochemical model analysis of luokuidong molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island.\nThe above data are published in EI Core Journal of Geoscience, the data are true and reliable, and the data are stored in the form of Excel.",
