            "description": "This data set is a data set of rock forming minerals of granite in Hengduan Mountain area. The rock forming minerals studied in this data set are mainly feldspar, biotite and amphibole. Their chemical composition is closely related to the physicochemical conditions at the time of formation. The concentration of trace elements in various rock forming minerals can reflect the source of their host rocks. The origin, occurrence, chemical composition, or, AB content and structural state of each rock forming mineral are mainly studied. The original data of this data set is digitized from the book \"geochemistry of Granitoids in Hengduan Mountain Area\". This data set provides data and analysis for the study of various rock forming minerals of Granitoids in Hengduan Mountain area. Their research provides a lot of information for the genesis of granitoids, is of great significance for inferring the formation mode, conditions and material sources of granitoids, and is valuable reference data for research in this field.",
