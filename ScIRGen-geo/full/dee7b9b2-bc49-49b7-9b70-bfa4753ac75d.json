This model has successfully been used to reconstruct and evaluate many GLOF events worldwide, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency. By utilizing the 2-dimensional flow surface, as well as a dam-breach hydrograph and high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), an unsteady flow simulation was conducted for each glacial lake with a high outburst potential in the Third Pole.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for simulating GLOFs in high-risk areas likely involve integrating outputs from a two-dimensional hydraulic model, HEC-RAS, with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and dam break hydrographs. These models simulate the maximum potential outburst scenarios for glacial lakes by assessing flow characteristics, such as inundation extent, flow depth, velocity, and arrival time. The integration of these datasets allows for the creation of hazard maps, calculating potential flood impacts over large areas, and providing a basis for exposure and risk assessments.",

                    "Answer": "The successful simulation of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions is attributed to the use of the HEC-RAS two-dimensional hydraulic model. This model has demonstrated practicality and efficiency for reconstructing and evaluating GLOF events globally. Key factors include the integration of dam-break hydrographs and high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) to simulate flood propagation. Additionally, simulations focus on non-steady flow scenarios for each glacial lake with high outburst potential, allowing for detailed analysis of flood inundation areas, flow depth, velocity, and arrival time. The results, including hazard maps based on maximum flow depth, velocity, and risk indices, provide a strong foundation for further assessment of exposure and outburst risks.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) combined with hydrological scenarios allows for detailed simulation of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs), leading to the identification of inundation extents, flow depths, velocities, and arrival times. This enhances understanding of flood hazards, potentially identifying approximately 6353 square kilometers of land threatened by such events, thus providing a basis for assessing exposure and risk of outburst events.",

This involves conducting unsteady flow simulations for each glacier lake with high outburst potential, resulting in output data such as inundation extent, flow depth, velocity, and arrival time. Additionally, a hazard map is calculated using the maximum flow depth, velocity, and hazard index to assess the risk.",

This model is combined with dam-break hydrographs and high-resolution digital elevation models (DEM) to simulate the propagation of floods from 1499 high-risk glacier lakes, especially focusing on scenarios with the highest potential for unstable flow. The outputs include flood inundation extents, flow depths, velocities, and arrival times, and are used to calculate hazard maps based on maximum flow depth, velocity, and hazard index.",
