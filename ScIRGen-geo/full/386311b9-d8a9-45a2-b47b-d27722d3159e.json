            "description": "Combining the revealed shallow geological and deep geophysical data in three-dimensional space for deep prediction can not only deepen the shallow understanding, but also reduce the problems caused by the multi solution of geophysics. It has become a new trend and important means of deep metallogenic prediction Taking the Wandongshan ore section of Beiya gold deposit as an example, the three-dimensional geological model of Wandongshan ore section is established in the three-dimensional modeling platform by collecting the data of drilling, exploration line section, geochemical exploration and geophysics; Based on the modeling results and integrating the surface, shallow and deep gravity data, the metallogenic geological conditions and deep metallogenic potential are studied and analyzed. Three metallogenic favorable elements of concealed fault, porphyry body and qingtianbao formation sandstone are selected, and the three-dimensional body model of metallogenic favorable area (sgrid) is established accordingly On this basis, the multi-source information synthesis method is adopted to collect the favorable metallogenic areas of three metallogenic control elements, and the deep target area within 1100 ~ 900 m above sea level in Wandongshan ore section is delineated, which provides a reference for the prediction of the deep target area of the surrounding same type of ore section",
