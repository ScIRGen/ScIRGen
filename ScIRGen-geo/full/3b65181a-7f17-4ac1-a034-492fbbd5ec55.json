            "description": "This dataset integrates comprehensive hourly observations of land-atmosphere interactions from 12 field observation stations on the Tibetan Plateau during the period of 2005 to 2021, including multi-layer meteorological data, multi-layer soil data, and turbulence data. The 12 field observation stations are the National Observation and Research Station for Qomolangma Special Atmospheric Processes and Environmental Changes (QOMS), the South-East Tibetan Plateau Station for integrated observation and research of alpine environment (SETORS), the Tibet Nam Co High-cold-lake and Environmental National Observation and Research Station (NAMORS), the Ngari Station for Desert Environment Observation and Research (NASED), the Muztagh Ata Westerly Observation and Research Station (MAWORS), Ngoring_Lake, Maqu, and TGL, Dashalong, Arou, Yakou, and Jingyangling Station. The multilayer meteorological data include wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, humidity, air pressure, and four components of radiation fluxes; the multilayer soil data include soil temperature and soil moisture; and the turbulence data include sensible heat flux and latent heat flux. Meanwhile, in view of the actual problems existing in the field observation data on the Tibetan Plateau, a data quality control program has been developed for different elements of each station, and a comprehensive field observation data processing system has been constructed. All observation elements have undergone a strict data quality control processes and  provided data quality control codes (0: correct data, 1: suspicious data, 2: incorrect data, 4: gap-filled data, 8: missing data, 9: not subjected to data quality control). This data can be widely applied in the analysis of meteorological element characteristics, evaluation of remote sensing product, development of remote sensing inversion algorithms, and evaluation and development of numerical simulations on the Tibetan Plateau.",
            "instructions": "This dataset file includes meteorological data (Met), soil data (Soil), and turbulence data (Flux), providing hourly observation data (Level0) and data products that have undergone data quality control (Level1). The naming convention for Level0 data files is: data type_ Site Name_ Year. csv, Level1 data file naming convention is QC_ Data type_ Site Name_ Year. csv. At the same time, the dataset also provides monthly data integrity and correct data proportion for each element at each site. The naming rule for data integrity files is: data type_ Site Name_ Avail.csv, where a value of 100 indicates that there are no missing observational data for this element in that month.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a critical role in influencing regional and global climate, via both thermal and dynamical mechanisms. Moreover, the TP has the most extensive high-elevation distribution of cryosphere outside the polar regions. Numerous research indicates that the TP plays an essential role in controlling regional and global climate through its thermal and mechanical mechanisms. Meanwhile, the TP is highly sensitive to climate change. Land–atmosphere interactions over the TP play a crucial role in controlling the hemispheric atmospheric circulation pattern and climate evolution. However, compared with other terrestrial regions of the world, observational data are scarce over the TP, owing to its vast geographic area with steep terrain, varied landforms, complex and diverse climates, and harsh environmental conditions. The sparse and biased spatial distribution of observation stations makes it difficult to match the high degree of landscape heterogeneity over the TP. Therefore, it is essential to improve the atmospheric observation capability on the TP and its surrounding areas and obtain accurate atmospheric physical parameters for the near-surface and boundary layers over the TP, which can significantly contribute to the scientific understanding of the weather, climate and environmental changes, as well as their impacts, from regional scale (TP) to global scale."

The release of these continuous and long-term datasets with hourly resolution represents a leap forward in scientific data sharing across the TP, and it has been partially used in the past to assist in understanding key land surface processes. This dataset is described here comprehensively for facilitating a broader multidisciplinary community by enabling the evaluation and development of existing or new remote sensing algorithms as well as geophysical models for climate research and forecasting."

                "However, meteorological stations are biased and sparsely distributed over the TP, owing to the harsh environmental conditions, high elevations, complex topography and heterogeneous surfaces. Moreover, due to the weak representation of the stations, atmospheric conditions and the local land–atmosphere coupled system over the TP as well as its effects on surrounding regions are poorly quantified. The sparse and biased spatial distribution of observation stations makes it difficult to match the high degree of landscape heterogeneity over the TP. In addition, high uncertainties in the satellite-retrieved land and atmospheric environmental variables of the TP impair the establishment of continuous, long-term regional-scale observations in remote areas of the TP. The lack of sufficient observational data limits our understanding of the interactions between the different earth spheres with heterogeneous land surface conditions and hinders the development of parameterization schemes in some critical physical processes of the land surface and atmospheric boundary layer, thereby leading to associated uncertainties in estimating the past, present and future climate change and its impacts."

Meteorological data were monitored by automatic weather stations (AWSs) or planetary boundary layer (PBL) observation systems. Multilayer soil temperature and moisture were recorded to capture vertical hydrothermal variations and the soil freeze–thaw process. In addition, an EC system consisting of an ultrasonic anemometer and an infrared gas analyzer was installed at each station to capture the high-frequency vertical exchanges of energy, momentum, water vapor and carbon dioxide within the atmospheric boundary layer."
