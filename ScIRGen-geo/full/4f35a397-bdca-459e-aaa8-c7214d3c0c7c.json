            "description": "The data set includes tourmaline in-situ boron isotope data and major element data of the Neogene magmatic rocks in the northern and southern margin of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The major element data of tourmaline were obtained by electron probe analysis, and the in-situ boron isotope data of tourmaline were obtained by laser ablation multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Tourmaline is derived from two Pliocene mica rhyolites from hudongliang in Songpan Ganzi massif and two Miocene mica granites from cuonadong in Himalayan massif δ The 11b values were -10.47 ± 0.54‰。 And -12.48 ± 1.04‰。 We believe that these strongly peraluminous magmatic rocks from the northern and southern margins of Tibet were mainly formed by subduction or partial melting of overlying continental sedimentary rocks.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of Neogene igneous rocks from the northern and southern margins of the Tibetan Plateau, 'in-situ boron isotope data' refers to the boron isotope measurements obtained directly from samples of tourmaline (a boron-bearing mineral) within these rocks. These measurements are conducted using laser ablation-multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS), which allows for precise isotopic analysis of boron within the mineral structure, providing insights into the geochemical processes involved in the formation of these rocks.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of electronic probe analysis for major elements and laser ablation multi-receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for in situ boron isotopes is likely influenced by the need for precise and accurate measurements of the elemental and isotopic composition of tourmaline in the Neogene igneous rocks from the north and south margins of the Tibetan Plateau. These methods provide the resolution and sensitivity required to analyze the complex geological samples, which are considered to have resulted from processes like subduction or partial melting of overlying continental sedimentary rocks.",

                    "Answer": "The in-situ boron isotope data from tourmaline are collected using laser ablation-multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, while the major element data are obtained through electron probe microanalysis. These techniques are applied to tourmaline from Miocene biotite granites and Pliocene biotite-rhyolites to understand the formation processes of strongly peraluminous magmatic rocks due to subduction or partial melting of overlying continental sedimentary rocks.",
