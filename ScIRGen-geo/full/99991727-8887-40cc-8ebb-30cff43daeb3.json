            "description": "This section was measured in the north of the Minzhuochaka Lake in the Nagri region. We collected and studied the fusulines, conodonts and smaller foraminifers from the Strata. The conodonts are dominated by Sweetognathus and Mesogondolella species. The fusulines are dominated by Neoschwagerina, Pseudodoliolina, Mesoschubertella. The smaller foraminifers consist mainly of Pachyphloia, Langella, Palaeotextularia and Tetrataxis. From the viewpoint of conodonts, their age is Kungurian. From the viewpoint of fusulines, it suggests a Murgabian age. The coexistence of fusulines and conodonts suggests that the upper Kungurian of International Scale correspond to the Murgabian of Tethyan Scale. This has provided robust evidence to support a correct correlation between the global scale and Tethyan scale of the Permian stage. In paleobiogeography, the present of conodonts and fusulines in the section suggests that the South Qiangtang Block was in a warm-water environment during the Kungurian time. By contrast, the Kungurian faunas in the Lhasa Block are dominated by cool-water taxa without any warm-water fusulines. The discovery of both conodonts and fusulines suggest a different paleobiogeography between the Lhasa and South Qiangtang blocks during the Kungurian time.",

These fossils include conodonts, fusulinids, and smaller foraminifera, which are identified and classified into genera such as Sweetognathus, Mesogondolella, Neoschwagerina, Pseudodoliolina, Mesoschubertella, Pachyphloia, Langella, Palaeotextularia, and Tetrataxis. The identification process helps determine the geological age and paleobiogeographical characteristics of the site.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in fossil identification and data collection methods could be influenced by the different types of fossils found in the area, such as conodonts, fusulinids, and small foraminifera. These fossils belong to different geological periods, with conodonts indicating the late Early Permian Kungurian period, while fusulinids suggest the Murgabian stage. Additionally, the paleobiogeographic differences between the warm-water fauna of the South Qiangtang Block and the cool-water fauna of the Lhasa Block during the Kungurian period could also affect the data collection approach.",

                    "Answer": "The collection and analysis of various fossil types, like conodonts, fusulinids, and small foraminifera, can reveal significant differences in paleobiogeography during the Kungurian period. This is because the presence of warm-water fauna in the South Qiangtang Block, contrasted with cold-water fauna in the Lhasa Block, indicates distinct paleobiogeographic conditions, suggesting these regions had different environmental and climatic conditions during the same period.",
