            "description": "The contents include: there is a sudden change of lithospheric thickness between the old Craton and the adjacent young active belt, Small scale mantle convection (boundary driven convection) can be induced by the transverse difference of temperature and density between the two. The boundary convection caused by the lithospheric step between the craton and the active zone and its role in the lithospheric thinning of the craton are discussed by using two-dimensional thermo mechanical numerical simulation method, When the density of the craton lithosphere is relatively high, the high-intensity craton lithosphere has a strong ability to resist boundary driven convection, and the thinning of the craton lithosphere is limited to the edge. However, the low-intensity craton lithosphere has a weak ability to resist boundary driven convection, When the density of the cratonic lithosphere is relatively small, no matter the strength of the cratonic lithosphere is high or low, the low density of the cratonic lithosphere can well inhibit the influence of boundary driven convection, The lithospheric thinning of the Archean North China Craton was confined by Phanerozoic active zones. The lithospheric thinning of the craton first occurred in the northern and Eastern margins and experienced a slow process, We believe that boundary driven convection may play an important role in the lithospheric thinning process of the North China Craton, especially in the initiation process of lithospheric thinning, but we can not rule out the joint action of other multiple mechanisms",

If the cratonic lithosphere has a relatively high density, it tends to resist the effects of boundary-driven convection, leading to thinning primarily at the edges. Conversely, a cratonic lithosphere with lower strength is more susceptible to erosion by descending flows, resulting in extensive thinning. When the lithosphere's density is low, it effectively inhibits boundary-driven convection's impact, causing thinning only at the edges as the lithosphere moves towards the active belt lithosphere's base.",
