            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in in No. 2 and 3 quadrates of the A'rou foci experimental areas on Mar. 15, 2008. \n     The Envisat ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 11:35 BJT. The quadrates were divided into 4×4 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. Only corner points of each subsite were chosen for observations.\n     In No. 2 quadrate, simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected, the soil temperature, soil volumetric moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, and the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the surface radiative temperature measured three times by the hand-held infrared thermometer, soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3). \n     In No. 3 quadrate, simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected, the soil temperature, soil volumetric moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, and the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, soil volumetric moisture by ML2X, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the surface radiative temperature measured three times by the hand-held infrared thermometer, soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3). Surface roughness was detailed in the \"WATER: Surface roughness dataset in the A'rou foci experimental area\". Besides, GPR (Ground Penetration Radar) observations were also carried out in No. 1 quadrate of A'rou. Those provide reliable ground data for retrieval and validation of soil moisture and freeze/thaw status from active remote sensing approaches.",

The primary difference is that in Arryo sample plot 3, an additional ML2X soil moisture rapid measurement instrument was used to acquire soil volumetric water content, providing potentially different data collection techniques and results in terms of soil moisture characteristics. Both plots involved using needle thermometers for 0-5cm average soil temperature and handheld infrared thermometers for surface radiation temperature measurements, as well as the collection of soil samples for drying to determine gravimetric water content, soil bulk density, and volumetric water content.",

Measurements include soil temperature, soil volumetric water content, loss tangent, soil conductivity, and soil complex permittivity (real and imaginary parts) using a POGO portable soil moisture sensor. Additionally, a needle thermometer measures the average soil temperature at 0-5cm depth, while a handheld infrared thermometer captures surface radiation temperature thrice. Soil samples are collected using a 100cm^3 ring knife for drying to determine weight moisture content, soil bulk density, and volumetric water content. For more detailed procedures, ground-based radar observations are conducted in specific sample plots.",

The synchronization is also supported by specific satellite data acquisition modes, such as the Envisat ASAR's AP mode with VV/VH polarization, and precise timing of satellite overpasses, approximately at 11:35 BJT, to ensure concurrent data collection with ground measurements. Additionally, the methodology involves sampling at each grid's corner in defined plots to enhance efficiency.",
