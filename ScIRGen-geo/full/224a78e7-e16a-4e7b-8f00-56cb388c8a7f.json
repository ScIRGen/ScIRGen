                "Radar remote sensing has demonstrated its applicability to the retrieval of basin-scale soil moisture. The mechanism of radar backscattering from soils is complicated and strongly influenced by surface roughness. Surface soil moisture (mv) is important in agronomic, hydrological, and meteorological processes at all spatial scales. The ability of inferring mv using both active and passive microwave techniques has been intensively demonstrated. It is well known that space-borne microwave radiometers and scatterometers possess the advantage of high revisit capacity but are deficient in coarse spatial resolution. On the contrary, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have the capability to provide finer spatial resolution, on the order of tens of meters, meeting most spatial requirements for watershed management and hydrological applications. The advanced IEM (AIEM) improves the calculation accuracy of scattering coefficient by keeping the absolute phase term in Greens function which was neglected by IEM. In the IEM and AIEM, surface roughness is an essential input, thus, if only a single configuration (e.g., one polarization, one frequency) of radar data is available, roughness parameters should be known as a priori information in order to retrieve soil moisture using these models."

The traditional point measurements can just provide a soil moisture distribution in a limited area. The hydrologic models can simulate the soil moisture variation in large spatial and temporal scales. However, the uncertainty in initial model state, model physical parameters, meteorological forcing variables and model equations brings much error in the soil moisture estimation. Many researchers suggested that the most promising approach for estimating soil moisture is the integration of remote sensing surface soil moisture data and a hydrologic model (Kostove and Jackson, 1993). Many researches have been carried out on optimizing a computational model through minimizing the difference between the observation and model simulation results by the re-parameterization (Jarlan et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2009) or re-initialization (Heathman et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2008) of the computational model separately. The re-parameterization approach can improve the model state variables by adjusting uncertain parameters. Since some parameters can hardly be obtained by field measurements, they are often estimated from the experiences or references, which brings much uncertainty to the model parameters. The re-initialization approach does not attribute the simulation errors to the uncertainties of the initial conditions, model parameters or model physical equations. It can adjust the state variables directly and it adopts the updated state variables as the initial field to re-initialize the model. The most effective and popular re-initialization approach is Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)."

When the ASAR data were available, a cost function was set up based on the gap between the backscattering coefficients from ASAR observation and the backscattering coefficients from the simulations. Then the EnKF was used to optimize the state variables. If the cost function was higher than twice the ASAR observation noises, the simulation was treated as unacceptable. Then the cost function was minimized by the GA approach. The sensitive parameters of the DHSVM were re-parameterized. The simulations were divided into acceptable and unacceptable cases.
