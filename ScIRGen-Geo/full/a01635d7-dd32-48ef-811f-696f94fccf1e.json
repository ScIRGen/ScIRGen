      "description": "The data set contains the flux observation data of large aperture scintillator from daman station in the middle reaches of heihe hydrometeorological observation network.Large aperture scintillators of BLS450 and BLS900 models were installed at daman station in the middle reaches of China. The north tower was the receiving end of BLS900 and the transmitting end of BLS450, and the south tower was the transmitting end and the receiving end of BLS900.The observation time is from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.The station is located in dazman irrigation district, zhangye city, gansu province.The latitude and longitude of the north tower is 100.3785 E, 38.8607 N, and the latitude and longitude of the south tower is 100.3685 E, 38.8468 N, with an altitude of about 1556m.The effective height of the large aperture scintillator is 22.45m, the optical diameter length is 1854m, and the sampling frequency is 1min.\nLarge aperture flicker meter raw observation data for 1 min, data released for after processing and quality control of data, including sensible heat flux is mainly combined with the automatic meteorological station observation data, based on similarity theory alonzo mourning - Mr. Hoff is obtained by iterative calculation, the quality control of the main steps include: (1) excluding Cn2 reach saturation data (Cn2 e-13 > 1.43);(2) data with weak demodulation signal strength (Average X Intensity<1000) were eliminated;(3) data at the time of precipitation were excluded;(4) data of weak turbulence under stable conditions were excluded (u* < 0.1m/s).In the iterative calculation process, the stability universal function of Thiermann and Grassl(1992) was selected. Please refer to Liu et al(2011, 2013) for detailed introduction.\nSome notes on the released data :(1) the middle LAS data is mainly BLS900, the missing time is supplemented by BLS450 observation, and the missing time of both is marked with -6999.(2) data table head: Date/Time: Date/Time (format: yyyy/m/d h:mm), Cn2: structural parameters of air refraction index (unit: m-2/3), H_LAS: sensible heat flux (unit: W/m2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al. (2011) for observation data processing.",

        "The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model was successfully applied to estimate evaporation (E), transpiration (T), and evapotranspiration (ET) for land covered with vegetation, which has significantly important applications for the terrestrial water cycle and water resource management. One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
        "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
        "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

In addition, the soil and canopy sensible heat fluxes were estimated using the series TSEB model, and their latent heat fluxes were calculated while solving the energy balance equations (1) and (2), respectively. The soil and canopy component temperatures were calculated using the images obtained with the thermal camera. To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities. Next, the simulated radiometric temperatures were validated against the surface radiometric temperatures, which were calculated according to the incoming long-wave radiation observed by the four-component radiometer."

        "AnswerEn": "The use of high-resolution thermal infrared cameras for estimating evapotranspiration in strongly advective irrigated agricultural areas presents significant benefits by providing detailed soil and canopy component temperatures. This data can be used to enhance the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, leading to reliable estimates of evapotranspiration ratios and latent heat fluxes. However, limitations include potential errors in component temperature estimation due to image classification errors and atmospheric effects, which can impact the model's accuracy. Despite these challenges, the approach shows promise in accurately separating soil and vegetation latent fluxes when component temperatures are precise.",
