            "description": "Different forms of precipitation (snow, sleet, and rain) have divergent effects on the Earth’s surface water and energy fluxes. Therefore, discriminating between these forms is of significant importance, especially under a changing climate. We applied a state-of-the-art parameterization scheme with wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, surface air pressure, and elevation as inputs, as well as observational gridded datasets with a maximum spatial resolution of 0.25◦, to generate a gridded dataset of different forms of daily precipitation (snow, sleet, and rain) and their temperature threshold across mainland China from 1961-2016. The annual snow, sleet, and rain amount were further calculated. The dataset may benefit various research communities, such as cryosphere science, hydrology, ecology, and climate change.",
            "instructions": "The data includes five files: snowfall, sleet, rainfall, snow-sleet temperature threshold (Tmin), and sleet-rainfall temperature threshold (Tmax), and their annual and daily scales are further stored separately. Data in .nc form can be read in MATLAB, Python, NCL and other programming languages, and can also be visualized in panoply.",

This is important because different precipitation types have varied impacts on the surface water cycle and energy balance. In this context, the scheme proposed by Ding et al. (2014) is used to separate precipitation types based on inputs such as wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, surface pressure, and elevation data, resulting in a daily gridded dataset for China spanning 1961-2016 with a spatial resolution of 0.25°.",
