            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with the airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in No. 1 and No. 3 quadrates of the A'rou foci experimental area on May 31, 2008. WiDAS, composed of four CCD cameras, one mid-infrared thermal imager (AGEMA 550), and one infrared thermal imager (S60), can acquire CCD, MIR and TIR band data. The simultaneous ground data were the surface radiative temperature and surface soil moisture.\n     The surface radiative temperature (emissivity: 1.0) was measured by the automatic thermometer at intervals of 0.05s, and the data were archived as .txt files (.dat format). The first seven rows were the header file, including acquisition date, time, and intervals; besides, Time (starting time), TObj (target temperature), Tint (the interior temperature of the probe), TBox (the temperature of the box) and Tact (the actual temperature calculated from the given emissivity) were also listed.\n     Soil moisture (0-12cm and 0-20cm) was measured by TDR. The data including the soil temperature, soil complex permittivity and soil conductivity, were archived in Excel format.",

It simultaneously captures data in visible/near-infrared (CCD) bands at 5 angles, mid-infrared (MIR) bands at 7 angles, and thermal infrared (TIR) bands at 7 angles.

Ground-based TDR measurements for soil moisture are collected at specific depths of 0-12cm and 0-20cm and are stored in Excel files, offering detailed soil moisture data but limited spatial coverage compared to the areal perspective of WiDAS. Temporal synchronization is achieved in ground-based methods through continuous monitoring, while WiDAS offers spatially extensive data but may require temporal alignment with surface observations for comprehensive analysis.",

This allows for comprehensive data collection across multiple angles, enhancing the reliability and depth of the observations.

The fixed self-recording thermometers have a sampling interval of 0.05 seconds, with the instrument's emissivity set to 1.0. Data is stored in text files (.dat format), which include a header with information such as the acquisition date and start time. The data columns include Time, TObj, Tint, TBox, and Tact. Soil moisture is measured at depths of 0-12cm and 0-20cm with TDR, saved in Excel format, including soil temperature, dielectric constant, and electrical conductivity.

Ground-based measurements include continuous recording of surface radiation temperature using self-recording thermometers with a sampling interval of 0.05 seconds, and soil moisture content using TDR at specified depths. Challenges in ensuring data accuracy and consistency may include calibration of instruments, synchronization of airborne and ground data in terms of time and location, and correcting temperature data for actual surface emissivity since instruments are set to an emissivity of 1.0, requiring adjustments based on real surface conditions.",
