      "description": "Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and potassium are important basic life elements of ecosystem. It plays an important role in revealing the impact of its regional variation and spatial pattern on human activities and the sustainable development of ecosystem in the future. The Qinghai Tibet Plateau has unique alpine vegetation types and rich vertical zone landforms and surface cover types. The biogeographic pattern of surface elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium) is an important manifestation of the coupling of carbon, nitrogen and water cycle processes and related mechanisms of alpine ecosystems. This dataset focuses on the distribution pattern and spatial variation of surface materials (plant leaf branch stem root and litter) in the complex ecosystem of the Water tower area of Qinghai Tibet Plateau and Himalayan Mountains, in order to provide data support for regional model simulation and ecological management.",

        "Sulfur (S) is an essential macroelement in plant growth and development, with important biological functions such as catalysis, regulation, and structure. S is closely related to photosynthesis, biotic or abiotic stress resistance, and secondary metabolism. S in vegetation is mainly sourced from the soil, with a small amount absorbed from the atmosphere by leaves. Despite the importance of S for plants, information on the patterns of S storage in the vegetation of terrestrial ecosystems remains limited. It is largely unknown how global climate change affects the biogeographic patterns of S, especially at large geographic scales."

      "methods": [
        "In this study, we used the grid method to investigate a total of 2,040 plant communities on the Tibetan Plateau and consistently measured the S content (g kg−1) and S density (t hm−2) in different plant organs. Field sampling was conducted during the peak plant growth period (July–August) in 2019–2020. The Tibetan Plateau was sampled on a grid basis (the plateau was divided into 0.5° × 0.5° geographic grids), with three randomly set sample squares in each grid. In each grid, a stratified survey was used to investigate the community structure of the forests, shrubland, grasslands, and deserts. Three sample plots were randomly set up for sampling trees (20 × 20 m), shrubs (20 × 20 m), and herbs (1 × 1 m), respectively. Well-grown tree plants in (or around) the sample plots were selected, and top sunny branches (diameter <1 cm) were collected using high branch scissors; subsequently, healthy, fully expanded leaves free of diseases and insects were hand-picked to form mixed leaf or fine branch samples for each sample plot, respectively. Growth cones were used to collect tree core samples; at the same time, intact fine roots (diameter <2 mm) were excavated along the lateral roots. For each shrub species, 1–3 healthy plants were selected in each sample plot, and the top branches of the canopy were intercepted using high-branch scissors to obtain mixed samples of leaves and branches, respectively; meanwhile, the shrub roots were obtained through excavation. Three mixed samples of leaves, branches, trunks, and roots of different species were obtained for each sample plot. Within each sample plot, 5–30 plants of each herbaceous species were selected, and above-ground (leaves and stems) and below-ground (roots) were collected. We mixed the above-ground and below-ground samples of different species within each grassland sample plot separately and evenly to obtain three mixed samples each. For each sample plot, soil samples were collected from 30 to 50 randomly selected points in the 0–10 cm surface layer using a soil sampler and mixed thoroughly to obtain three mixed samples. We collected 5,360 plant samples and 2,040 soil samples in total. A standard method was used to measure the S content (g kg−1) in leaves (Sleaf), branches (Sbranch), trunks (Strunk), and roots (Sroot). First, the surfaces of different plant organ samples were cleaned and then dried to a constant weight at 65°C for 48 hr. Soil samples were air-dried and sieved using a 2 mm mesh to remove stones and roots. Then, all plant and soil samples were finely ground using an agate mortar grinder (RM200; Retsch, Haan, Germany) and a ball mill (MM400 Ball Mill; Retsch). All plant samples were digested using a microwave digestion system (CEM, Matthews, NC, USA) before analysis. GBW10020 (GSB-11 Citrus leaf) and GBW07407a (GSS-7a) were used as Certified Reference Material for the measurement of plant S content, respectively. Finally, an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-OES; Optima Avio 500, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to measure the S content in plant samples."

The mean S densities for forests (5.59 ± 0.26 × 10 −2 t hm −2) were higher than that of shrublands (4.54 ± 0.51 × 10 −2 t hm −2), grasslands (1.03 ± 0.07 × 10 −2 t hm −2), and deserts (1.32 ± 0.28 × 10 −2 t hm −2). The S density was generally lower in the northwest and higher in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau and had divergent allocation patterns between different plant organs and vegetation types. Furthermore, we found that S in leaves and roots was more strongly influenced by environmental factors and was particularly sensitive to radiation and atmospheric pressure. Moreover, the total S storage in the vegetation of the Tibetan Plateau was estimated to be 337.32 × 10 4 t, with 114.32 × 10 4 (33.89%), 92.36 × 10 4 (27.38%), 128.77 × 10 4 (38.17%), and 1.86 × 10 4 t (0.55%) in the forests, shrublands, grasslands, and deserts, respectively."
