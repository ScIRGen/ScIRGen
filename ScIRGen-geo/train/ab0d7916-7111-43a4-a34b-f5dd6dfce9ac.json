            "description": "We have studied the Petrotectonic attributes of granites distributed in a large area in the North Lancangjiang structure in Bitu area. The major and trace elements and Sr Nd isotopes have been completed in the Key Laboratory of deposit geochemistry, Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Among them, the main elements are analyzed by pw4400 X-ray fluorescence instrument, and the contents of 10 element oxides are determined; Trace elements are tested by ICP-MS inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. ICP-MS is manufactured by Agilent company in Tokyo, Japan, and the model is Agilent 7700x. The analysis method is the same as that of Zhang Xin, etc. According to the analysis results of standard sample gbpc-1de, the analysis error is less than 5%. MC-ICP-MS double focusing magnetic mass spectrometer with Neptune plus model is used for isotope test experiment. The test basis is GB / T 17672-1999.",

Additionally, the sample preparation process and the quality of the standard samples like GBPC-1 could influence the accuracy, as any deviation in these steps might result in errors. The analysis method, as referenced by Zhang Xin et al., may also contribute to errors if not meticulously followed.",
