            "description": "The Cenozoic strata developed within and around the Tibetan Plateau, contain fruitful information on the tectonic evolution, paleoenvironment and paleoclimate changes. It's very significant on revealing the history of the uplift and deformation of the Tibetan Plateau and its relevant effects on the regional and even global environment and climate. This data set contains several well developed sections, which have been identified by the systematic geological survey. Depending on the tools (e.g. GPS, geological compass) in the fieldwork, we have finished the geological measurements and descriptions of these sections as well as the relevant geological maps. It includes a 90-m loess deposit of the Duikang section in the Linxia basin, several fluvial and lacustrine deposits (such as the 1890-m Dayu section in the Lunpola basin, the 300-m Shuanghe section in the Jianchuan basin, the 252-m Caijiachong section in the Qujing basin) and a 932-m saline lacustrine deposit with gypsolyte of the Jiangcheng section in the Simao basin. This data set provides a solid geological foundation for the following researches on stratigraphic chronology, tectonic evolution, paleoenvironment and paleoclimate, and so forth.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of data collection for geological datasets, 'systematic field geological survey' refers to a methodical approach to investigating geological formations through direct observation and measurement in the field. This process involves identifying and documenting geological features such as stratigraphy, lithology, and structural configurations using tools like GPS and geological compasses. The goal is to gather accurate data about the geological characteristics of specific locations, which can be used to create detailed maps and diagrams for further analysis.",

                    "Answer": "The systematic geological investigations of Cenozoic strata in the Tibetan Plateau and its neighboring regions are influenced by the need to uncover the rich tectonic, environmental, and climatic information within these strata. This involves conducting comprehensive field geological surveys using tools such as GPS and geological compasses to measure and describe structures, landforms, and lithologies, followed by the creation of relevant maps and diagrams. Such investigations lay a solid geological foundation for further research into stratigraphic chronology, tectonic evolution, and climate-environmental impacts.",

                    "Answer": "Conducting systematic field geological surveys in the Cenozoic strata of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its neighboring regions using tools like GPS and geological compass can provide detailed insights into the tectonic, geomorphological, and lithological characteristics of the area. These surveys result in the identification of well-developed research profiles and the creation of relevant charts, which offer a solid geological foundation for subsequent studies on stratigraphic chronology, tectonic evolution, and climate environment effects. This comprehensive data collection can enhance the understanding of the history of plateau collision, uplift deformation, and their environmental impacts.",

                    "Answer": "The objective is to uncover the rich information contained in the Cenozoic strata of the Tibetan Plateau and its neighboring regions, which is crucial for understanding the tectonic deformation history and the climatic and environmental effects of the plateau's collision and uplift. This involves systematic geological field investigations of well-developed sections using tools like GPS and geological compasses to describe and map the tectonic, geomorphic, and lithological features of these areas.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve systematic field geological investigations in well-developed research sections using tools like GPS and geological compasses to conduct surveys and descriptions in areas such as the Linxia Basin, Lunpola Basin, Jianchuan Basin, Qujing Basin, and Simao Basin. These steps include measuring and describing structural, geomorphological, and lithological aspects of these sections and creating relevant maps. The research specifically focuses on loess deposits, fluvial-lacustrine sediments, and saline lake deposits interlayered with gypsum and salt, laying a solid geological foundation for further studies on stratigraphic chronology, tectonic evolution, and climate environment effects.",
