            "description": "Background: Social frailty is one type of frailty. Physical frailty with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVD) have been studied a lot, but less research on social frailty.\nObjectives: To study the prevalence, related risk factors and regional differences of social frailty with CCVD in Chinese older adults.\nMethods: SSAPUR was a national cross-sectional survey. Participants aged 60 years or older were recruited in August 2015. Demographic data and information regarding family, health and medical conditions, living environment conditions, social participation, spiritual and cultural life, and health condition were obtained. Social frailty was assessed in five areas (HALFE Social Frailty Index) including inability to help others, limited social participation, loneliness, financial difficulty, and living alone. The prevalence of CCVD with social frailty, related risk factors and regional differences in CCVD with social frailty were studied.\nResults: A total of 222,179 participants were enrolled. 28.4% of them had CCVD history. The prevalence of social frailty in the CCVD group was 16.03%. In CCVD participants, compared with the group without social frailty, there were significant differences in gender, age, urban-rural distribution, ethnicity, marital status, and education levels in the social frailty group. Significant differences were also found in physical exercise participation, health status, cataract, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hospitalization within 1 year, self-assessed health status, crutch or wheelchair usage, urinary and fecal incontinence, need for care from others, fall history, housing satisfaction, and self-assessed happiness in the social frailty group. Women with CCVD had a higher prevalence of social frailty than men. By age in CCVD with social frailty, the highest prevalence was found in participants 75-79 years old. The prevalence of CCVD was significant difference between social frailty in urban and rural group. The prevalence of social frailty with CCVD was significantly different in different regions. The highest prevalence was 20.4% in southwest area, and the lowest prevalence was 12.5% in northeast with area.\nConclusion: The prevalence of social frailty among the CCVD older adults is high. Factors such as gender, age, region, urban-rural residence, and the state of the disease may be associated with social frailty.",

                "It is estimated that over 300 million Chinese people will be 60 years of age or older by 2025. With this aging demographic, the prevalence of chronic diseases like cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs) and frailty will increase. Frailty describes a state of vulnerability due to an age-related decline in several physiological systems and is associated with a considerably increased risk of falling, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Existing research on risk factors of frailty mainly focuses on sociodemographic, physiological, and biological risk factors. In recent years, frailty has evolved from a concept focused on physical frailty to one that encompasses multiple health aspects (physical, psychological, and social). Social frailty is a risk factor for long-term mortality and disability, and has a prevalence of approximately 18%–30% among community-dwelling older adults. Frailty is believed to have a bidirectional effect on cardiovascular diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that frailty is a risk factor for CCVDs, even after accounting for subclinical atherosclerosis. Conversely, CCVD risk factors and risk scores may predict frailty: frailty is associated with a higher risk of CCVD prevalence. Therefore, frailty can be considered both a consequence of and a potential risk factor for CCVDs."

Women with CCVDs had a higher prevalence of social frailty than men with CCVDs. The highest prevalence of social frailty in the CCVD group was observed in participants aged 75–79. There existed significant differences in the prevalence of social frailty in CCVD patients with hypertension and CCVD patients with diabetes. The prevalence of social frailty in CCVD patients also varied based on region: Southwest China had the highest prevalence of social frailty (20.4%) and the Northeast had the lowest prevalence rate (12.5%). The prevalence of social frailty combined with CCVDs was 11.8% in urban areas and 21.3% in rural areas, with significant differences. Multivariate regression analysis showed that gender, age, educational level, marital status, living in an urban vs. rural environment, physical exercise, number of comorbid chronic diseases, lung diseases, cancer, wheelchair usage, fecal incontinence, fall history, housing satisfaction, self-assessed happiness, and self-care ability were all associated with social frailty in CCVD patients."

                    "Answer": "To assess social frailty in older adults with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, one can utilize a nationwide cross-sectional survey approach like the SSAPUR. This involves collecting demographic, health, and lifestyle data and assessing social frailty using a framework such as the HALFE social frailty index. This index evaluates aspects like inability to help others, limited social participation, loneliness, economic hardship, and living alone. Statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA and Chi-square tests, can be used to compare characteristics, while logistic regression can estimate variables associated with social frailty.",

The SSAPUR survey, for example, covered 31 provinces and multiple districts, ensuring a diverse sample. Additionally, including various settings such as urban and rural environments helps in capturing the demographic diversity. It's also essential to collect data on different domains including health status, social participation, and living conditions to ensure a holistic view of the population.",

                    "Answer": "To perform a statistical analysis of social frailty data, the following steps are necessary: first, data must be collected and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and completeness. Quantitative data should be checked for normal distribution. Analyses such as one-way ANOVA can be used for normally distributed data, while Chi-square tests can handle categorical data. Multivariate logistic regression is then employed to determine the odds ratios and confidence intervals for variables associated with social frailty. The use of statistical software like SPSS 24.0 is recommended for these analyses.",

This comprehensive approach enables researchers to identify regional differences in social frailty, as demonstrated by the SSAPUR survey's findings of varying prevalence rates across different Chinese regions.",
