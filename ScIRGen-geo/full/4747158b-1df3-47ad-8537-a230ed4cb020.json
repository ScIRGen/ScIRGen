            "description": "The widely definition of seasonally frozen ground include seasonally frozen layer (seasonally frozen ground regions) and seasonally thaw layer (active layer in permafrost regions). So the area extent of seasonally frozen ground occupied more than 80% land surface over Northern Hemisphere. Soil freeze/thaw cycle is one special character of seasonally frozen ground, which covers area extent, depth, time duration, variation of soil freeze/thaw. These changes in seasonally frozen ground have substantial impacts on energy, water and carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface, surface and sub-surface hydrologic processes, vegetation growth, the ecosystem, carbon dioxide cycle, agriculture, and engineering constructuion, as a whole.Based on the observations from sites, CRU air temperature, we used the Stefan solution to calculate the spatial distribution of active layer thickness and soil freeze depth during 1971-2000. These results are helpful to further study the physical mechanism between seasonally frozen ground and climate change, eco-hydrology process.",

Detailed knowledge of ALT variations is also important for studies on ecosystem, hydrological, and geomorphological processes in cold regions. The combined land and ocean surface air temperatures increased 0.858C from 1880 to 2012 (IPCC 2013). Compared to the global mean, the rate and magnitude of temperature rise were much greater in high-latitude and high-altitude regions. This temperature rise has resulted in worldwide permafrost degradation, including an increase in active layer thickness (ALT). These ALT changes in permafrost regions can subsequently affect geomorphic processes, hydrologic processes, land cover and vegetation, infrastructure, and the sustainability of northern communities. ALT is an important indicator of climate change in permafrost regions. Previous studies have developed several ground-based measurement methods to determine ALT at the point scale by using mechanical probing, thaw tubes, and ground temperature measured in boreholes. At the regional scale, some indirect measurements of ALT have been developed using, for example, remote sensing and modeling techniques. Changes in ALT have been reported at regional, hemispheric, and global scales (IPCC 2013). Climatic factors play a dominant role in accounting for the spatial and temporal variability of ALT at all scales, but nonclimatic factors such as vegetation cover, soil properties, and environmental factors are also critical."

Although some biases in the E factor using the simplified Stefan solution produce uncertainties in the ALT estimate, the standard deviation of the E factor and the ALT verification between observed and simulated data suggest that the simplified Stefan solution can be effectively used for ALT calculations at the hemisphere scale (Anisimov et al. 1997)."

                "The response of seasonal soil freeze depth to climate change has repercussions for the surface energy and water balance, ecosystems, the carbon cycle, and soil nutrient exchange. Despite its importance, the response of soil freeze depth to climate change is largely unknown. Frozen ground is an important component of the cryosphere. Permafrost regions underlay approximately 24% of the exposed land surface of the Northern Hemisphere, and seasonally frozen ground (SFG) regions occupy 57%. China has the third-largest frozen ground extent in the world, with a permafrost area of ∼2.20 × 10^6 km^2, or approximately 23% of its land area, mainly on the Tibetan Plateau; regions with SFG occupy about 50% of the land area in China. Under warming climate conditions, frozen ground regions are vulnerable to subsidence, especially ice-rich permafrost and relatively warm discontinuous permafrost. Maximum soil freeze depth (SFD) of SFG and active layer depth over permafrost play a significant role in cold environments, and all hydrological, ecological, biological, and pedological activities occur within this layer. Simultaneously, SFD influences the surface and subsurface hydrologic cycle, promotes soil texture changes, and alters the availability of soil nutrients for plant growth. The soil freeze–thaw cycle and SFD variations affect the decomposition of soil organic matter and greenhouse gas exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere. Thus, seasonal SFD variability and climate are closely linked. Due to global climate warming, significant efforts have been devoted to permafrost research, such as permafrost variations on the hemispheric-scale permafrost temperature changes, permafrost degradation, hydrological processes in permafrost regions, feedbacks to climate change, and other aspects.",
                "The freezing and thawing index can also be an important indicator to assess the variations in frozen ground. There are two primary types of freezing and thawing indices: the surface freezing and thawing index, calculated from ground surface temperatures, and the air freezing and thawing index, computed from air temperatures. Various methods are available to calculate the soil freeze depth. For example, it can be estimated directly from soil temperature, from physical and statistical models, and based on the Stefan solution. Soil freeze–thaw depth changes involve a series of interactions, such as energy exchanges, soil moisture exchanges, and gas exchanges between the atmospheric and terrestrial system. Therefore, variations of soil freeze–thaw most likely have an important effect on geomorphic, hydrological, and biological processes. Similarly, soil freeze–thaw depth changes also have destabilizing effects on engineering structures, such as on improperly constructed infrastructure. The freezing and thawing indices represent the accumulated negative and positive degree days in the cold and warm seasons, respectively. Temperature – including MAGST and MAAT – at the 839 station locations exhibits a statistically significant increase over the 1951–2013 period of 0.019 and 0.013 ◦C yr−1, or approximately 1.2 ◦C and 0.78 ◦C over the 63 years, respectively. The positive and negative correlation between SFD and FI and TI was statistically significant, consistent with previous results in other regions."

The data processing steps are to (1) calculate the average monthly atmospheric lapse rate based on all available meteorological stations across China and their elevations; (2) bring each average monthly gridded air temperature value to a reference level (elevation of 0 m) using the average monthly lapse rate; (3) apply a Kriging interpolation to the reference-level adjusted MMGAT; and (4) bring the gridded reference-level air temperature back to the DEM-gridded height. To estimate the SFD at the regional scale across China, we first calculate SFD for every observational station by interpolating the depth of the 0 ◦C isotherm throughout the 0.0–3.2 m soil profile using the daily mean soil temperature. Next, we estimate the FIa based on the calculations in Frauenfeld et al. (2007). To estimate the E value for all stations, we use the SFD, FIa, and Eqs. (2) and (3). Then, we interpolate the E value to the regional scale at 1 km resolution using kriging in ArcGIS. The SFD is estimated across China based on Eq. (4), the 1 km E value, and FIa. We can then estimate the regional-scale SFD for each year from 1950 to 2009 across China and obtain the mean decadal SFD. Finally, we estimate the SFD trend at the regional scale across China based on regression analysis. To evaluate the result, we compare the observational SFD calculated from the soil temperatures and the simulated SFD derived from the Stefan method (Eq. 4) in Fig. 3."

Mean monthly gridded air temperature was used to analyze soil freeze depth at the regional scale across China. We obtained the University of Delaware’s 1900–2014 terrestrial air temperature gridded monthly time series, with a 0.5°×0.5° spatial resolution. Considering the complex terrain across China and the impacts of elevation on air temperature, we also used the global 30 arcsec elevation dataset (GTOPO30) as the DEM for this study to further improve the MMGAT resolution. We obtained daily mean snow depth data for 672 sites across China. The NDVI dataset used in this study is produced by the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) team, available for 1982–2006. It is derived from NOAA AVHRR data, available at 15-day temporal resolution and an 8 km spatial resolution.",

Based on the sites’ E factors and FI a, we calculate SFD time series anomalies from 1951 to 2012.

On the regional scale, soil freeze depth decreases varied between 0.0 and 0.4 cm yr−1 in most parts of China during 1950–2009. By investigating potential climatic and environmental driving factors of soil freeze depth variability, we find that mean annual air temperature and ground surface temperature, air thawing index, ground surface thawing index, and vegetation growth are all negatively associated with soil freeze depth. Changes in snow depth are not correlated with soil freeze depth. Air and ground surface freezing indices are positively correlated with soil freeze depth. Comparing these potential driving factors of soil freeze depth, we find that freezing index and vegetation growth are more strongly correlated with soil freeze depth, while snow depth is not significant. We conclude that air temperature increases are responsible for the decrease in seasonal freeze depth.",

As is expected from climate warming, a statistically significant decreasing trend in SFD is evident across China from 1950 to 2009.
