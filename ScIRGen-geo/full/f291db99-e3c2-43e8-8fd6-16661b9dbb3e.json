            "description": "In 2019, the major and trace element analysis of the getengling pluton was completed in the State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) was used for the analysis. The instrument model is RIGAKU zsx100e, and the accuracy of major element analysis is better than 5%. See Li Xianhua and Liu Ying (2002) for the specific process. Plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) was used for trace element analysis. The model is Perkin Elmer SCIEX Elan drc-e, and the analysis accuracy is better than 5%. The specific analysis method and process can be seen in Liu Ying and Liu Haichen (1996) and Liang Xirong et al. (2000)",
