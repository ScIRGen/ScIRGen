            "description": "This dataset contains the flux observation matrix measurements obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the Daman superstation between 10 May and 26 September, 2012. The site (100.37223° E, 38.85551° N) was located in a cropland (maize surface) in the Daman irrigation, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1556.06 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (AV-14TH; 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (windsonic; 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 2.5 m), four-component radiometer (PSP&PIR; 12 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (IRTC3; 12 m, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (LI-190SB; 12 m, towards south), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (TCAV; -0.02, -0.04 m), soil temperature profile (AV-10T; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), and soil heat flux (HFP01SC; 3 duplicates with one below the vegetation; and the other between plants, -0.06 m). \nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_3 m, Ta_5 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m, Ta_20 m, Ta_30 m, and Ta_40 m; RH_3 m, RH_5 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m, RH_20 m, RH_30 m, and RH_40 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_3 m, Ws_5 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m, Ws_20 m, Ws_30 m, and Ws_40 m, m/s), wind direction (WD_3 m, WD_5 m, WD_10 m, WD_15 m, WD_20 m, WD_30 m, and WD_40 m, °), air pressure (press, hpa), precipitation (rain, mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation; W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IR_2, ℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, μmol/ (s m^-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, below the vegetation; Gs_2, and Gs_3, W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm, ℃), and soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm, %).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows. (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min; therefore, there were 144 records per day. The missing data were filled with -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) In this dataset, the time of 0:10 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:10; the data were stored in *.xlsx format. (5) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

This setup typically includes sensors for wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, CO2 concentration, water vapor density, radiation components, and soil properties. These measurements are taken at multiple heights and depths to capture the spatial variability and dynamics of the surface-atmosphere interactions over a defined area, such as a farmland with specific vegetation. The data collected by this matrix is used to study processes like evapotranspiration and energy balance.",

                    "Answer": "The multi-layer sensor setup, as described, involves placing sensors at various heights and depths, which allows for a comprehensive capture of environmental variables such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and soil moisture and temperature. This setup provides a detailed vertical profile of the observed parameters, enabling the analysis of gradients and changes with height or depth. In contrast, a single-layer sensor setup would only provide data at one fixed point, potentially missing out on vertical variations and limiting the understanding of the environment's heterogeneity.",

                    "Answer": "The arrangement of sensors at varying heights and orientations allows for a detailed vertical profile of meteorological variables, providing insights into how these variables change with altitude. For example, measuring wind speed and direction at multiple heights can help infer wind shear and turbulence characteristics. Similarly, monitoring temperature and CO2 concentration at different altitudes can reveal vertical gradients and stratification in the atmosphere, which are critical for understanding surface-atmosphere interactions and energy balances.",

The data aids in the calibration and validation of remote sensing models and improves the understanding of energy and mass exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere.",

Missing data points are marked with a placeholder value of -6999. (2) Removing any duplicate records to maintain data integrity. (3) Deleting data points that are evidently outside physical plausibility or beyond the instrument's range. (4) Standardizing the format of date and time to ensure consistency across data records. This includes placing both date and time in a single column, for instance, '2012-6-10 10:30'. (5) Following a specific naming convention for the data files, such as using 'AMS' followed by the site number, assists in organizing and identifying different datasets accurately.",
