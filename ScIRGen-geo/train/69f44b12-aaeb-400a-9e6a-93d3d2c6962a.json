            "description": "Xizang winter wheat is a high yield crop developed rapidly in 1970s. It plays an important role in the crop production of wenliang River Valley, promotes the reform of plateau farming system, and plays an important role in increasing grain production in the whole region. The successful large-scale planting of winter wheat in Xizang has aroused strong response at home and abroad. In the course of development of Winter wheat in Xizang province, various unbalance phenomena will inevitably occur: severe dead seedlings in winter and spring; The growth process is too long and it is difficult to change stubble; Single variety; The steady increase of yield was affected by the failure of fertilizer and water condition and extensive cultivation management. Therefore, it is of positive significance to consolidate and develop winter wheat production in Tibet by summing up the experience of winter wheat development in the past ten years, expounding the basic characteristics of winter wheat production in plateau and discussing the main ways of increasing winter wheat production.",

                    "Answer": "In studying the large-scale cultivation of winter wheat in Tibet from 1973 to 1976, data collection methods likely involved field surveys to monitor crop health, growth patterns, and yield outputs. Challenges in this process could have included harsh environmental conditions such as severe winter-spring seedling mortality, difficulties with crop rotation due to extended growth periods, and limitations in variety and resource management, which could affect consistent data gathering.",

                    "Answer": "Potential datasets could include agricultural yield records, climate data specific to the Tibetan plateau, soil quality assessments, and water resource availability. These datasets would provide insights into the impact of winter wheat cultivation on both agricultural productivity and ecological changes, considering issues like resource allocation and crop management practices.",
