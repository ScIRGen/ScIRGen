            "description": "The data of major and trace elements were analysed by ICP-MS at the State Key Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Zircon U-Pb ages and trace elements were analysed by LA-ICP-MS at the Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny of CAS, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The international standard samples and reference values measured in the same batch are consistent within the error range, with low blank in the whole process. The data quality is accurate and reliable. The samples of Guandian pluton show high SiO2 (59.15-62.32%), Al2O3 (14.51-15.38%), Sr (892-1184 ppm), Sr/Y (57.63-86.32) and low Y (12.65-18.05 ppm), similar to typical geochemical features of adakite. The Guandian adakite also exhibits high K2O (2.88-3.86%), MgO (3.89-5.24%) and Mg# (55-60), negative anomalies of high field strength elements (HFSE, e.g., Nb, Ta and Ti) and positive anomalies of Ba, Pb and Sr. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating yielded a weighted average age of 129.2 ± 0.7 Ma. Calculations of zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ (6.79-145) and (Eu/Eu*)N (0.23-0.42) on the basis of in situ zircon trace element analysis indicate that the magma had a lower oxygen fugacity relative to the ore-bearing adakites in the LYRB and Dexing, which is consistent with the fact of ore-barren in the research area. In combination with previous research, we propose that Guandian adakite was formed by partial melting of delaminated lower continental crust triggered by Early Cretaceous ridge subduction of the Pacific and Izanagi plates.",

                    "Answer": "In geochemical studies in the Yangtze River region, ICP-MS is used for determining major elements, providing accurate and reliable data due to low full-process blanks and consistency with international standards.

The accurate measurement of elements such as SiO2, Al2O3, Sr, Y, and the Sr/Y ratio, as well as the U-Pb dating, helps in confirming the adakitic characteristics, which in turn supports geological interpretations related to crustal melting and tectonic processes such as ridge subduction-induced crustal delamination. Furthermore, the consistent results with international standards and low process blanks ensure the reliability of the data in geological studies.",
