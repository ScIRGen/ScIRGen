            "description": "High Mountain Asia is the third largest cryosphere on earth other than the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The  large amounts of glaciers and snow over the High Mountain Asia play an important role not only on global water cycle but also on water resources and ecology of the arid regions of central Asia. The snowline, as the lower boundary of the snow covered area at the end of melting season, its altitude changes can directly reflect the changes in snow and glaciers. The snowline altitude provides a possibility to rapidly obtain a proxy for their equilibrium line altitude (ELA) which in turn is an indicator for the glacier mass balance. In this dataset, the daily MODIS snow cover products from 2001 to 2019 are used as the main data source. The cloud removal of the daily MODIS snow cover products was firstly carried out based on the developed cubic spline interpolation cloud-removel method, and snow covered days (SCD) are extracted using the cloud-removed MODIS snow cover products. In addition, the MODIS SCD threshold for estimating perennial snow cover is calibrated using the observed data of glacier annual mass balance and Landsat data at the end of melting season. The altitude value of the snowline at the end of melting season is determined by combining the perennial snow cover area and the hypsometric (area-elevation) curve.  Finally, the 30km gridded dataset of snowline altitude in the High Mountain Asia during 2001-2019 is generated. This dataset can provide data support for the study of cryosphere and climate change over the High Mountain Asia.",

                "In the context of global climate change, the cryosphere's components have become a focal point of global change research, with snow being the most active component of the cryosphere, playing an important role in the global energy and water cycle due to its high albedo, high phase change latent heat, and low thermal conductivity. In hydrological and remote sensing research, the snowline is defined as the boundary line between snow-covered and snow-free areas, also known as the transient snowline. The snowline at the end of the ablation season is also commonly referred to as the snowline at the end of the melting season. In glacier and climate change research, the snowline refers to the zero balance line between annual snowfall and ablation, equivalent to the snowline at the end of the melting season. The altitude of the snowline at the end of the ablation season is considered an approximate value of the glacier mass balance line altitude and can indicate the annual mass balance of glaciers, serving as a sensitive indicator of climate change. High Mountain Asia, also known as Central Asia, is the third largest cryosphere in the world outside the polar regions and has the largest snow-covered area in the mid-latitudes, with its extensive glacier and snow distribution significantly impacting atmospheric circulation, water cycles, and radiation balance in Asia and even globally."

The study seeks to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of snowline altitude at the end of the ablation season in High Mountain Asia at a 30 km scale using a variogram model and to analyze the influencing factors of spatial differences in snowline altitude at the end of the ablation season in High Mountain Asia from two aspects: (1) fitting the snowline altitude of the entire High Mountain Asia and six sub-regions with three variables: latitude, longitude, and altitude; (2) exploring the impact of climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, radiation) on the spatial differences of interannual variation in snowline altitude at the end of the ablation season in High Mountain Asia and quantitatively analyzing its dominant factors."

The extraction method first cloud-cleared the daily MODIS snow cover fraction product to obtain the snow cover days (SCD) dataset; then, the MODIS SCD threshold for extracting perennial snow was calibrated using glacier annual mass balance observation data and melting season Landsat data; finally, for any glacier grid, the snowline altitude information at the end of the ablation season was extracted at a large scale by combining the perennial snow area extracted by MODIS SCD with the \"area-elevation\" curve of the terrain."

The snowline altitude in the inner Tibet Plateau is relatively high (5,967 m a.s.l.) and shows a small gradient of spatial variation; the lower values of snowline altitude (< 4,500 m) appear in the northern regions of High Mountain Asia (the Altay Mts. and the Tianshan Mts.); the contour lines of snowline altitude are the densest in the west of High Mountain Asia. The relative contribution ratios of the influences of latitude, longitude, and altitude on snowline altitude at the end of the ablation season are 60.5%, 2.6%, and 36.9%, respectively, and the relative contribution ratios vary for different sub-regions. Summer mean air temperature is the dominant factor affecting the snowline altitude at the end of the ablation season in High Mountain Asia, and 45.6% of the grids are influenced by summer mean air temperature and distributed in all the subregions; the grids mainly affected by annual precipitation account for about 18%, which are mainly distributed in the Karakoram Mountains and Pamir; only 10% of the grids are mainly affected by annual radiation (upward long wave flux at ground surface)."
