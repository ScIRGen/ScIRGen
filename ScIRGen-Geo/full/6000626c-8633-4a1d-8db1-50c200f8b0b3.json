Based on the monthly average night time light image data of visible infrared imaging radiometer Suite (VIIRS) of national polar orbiting partnership (NPP) satellite, this dataset is generated by separating the unstable night light caused by biomass combustion from the stable night light information caused by human activities. The spatial resolution of the data is 500 m, and the grid data type is GeoTIFF. The grid pixel value is radiance, and the unit is 10 − 9 w ∙ cm − 2 ∙ SR − 1. The data set improves the ability of noctilucent images to identify small-scale, scattered and unstable urban information in northern equatorial Africa and Sahel to a certain extent, and can be further applied to the research on human activities in northern equatorial Africa and Sahel.",

                "Observing and understanding changes in Africa is a hotspot in global ecological environmental research since the early 1970s. As possible causes of environmental degradation, frequent droughts and human activities attracted wide attention. Remote sensing of nighttime light provides an effective way to map human activities and assess their intensity. Nighttime light is a good indicator of human activity. Satellite-borne imaging radiometers capture accurate nighttime light data, thus providing the opportunity to study the nighttime light quantitatively in large areas. Low power penetration affects the northern Equatorial Africa and Sahel region, where power cuts occur frequently. The electricity deficit is one of the main problems in the development of this region. The visible near-infrared (VNIR) image data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) are widely used to capture stable nighttime light. More recent data acquired by the National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) were applied for the same purpose. Compared to DMSP-OLS, NPP-VIIRS has the advantages of higher spatial resolution (about 742 m) and on-board calibration, and it is not affected by saturation and has a higher dim light sensitivity. Earlier studies on the detection and characterization of human settlements using nighttime light data relied on the estimation of an optimal threshold on radiance according to reference data, on using ancillary data, and on change detection."

                "The aim of this study was to propose a better way to extract information about human activities in northern Equatorial Africa and Sahel from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) monthly nighttime light data. The objective of this study was to provide a new method (i.e., the patches filtering method, PFM) for filtering NPP-VIIRS monthly nighttime light data to improve the ability to identify small settlements, including small and scattered ones, which required the separation of stable nighttime lights associated with settlements from unstable nighttime lights due to biomass burning."
            ],
            "challenges": [
                "The biggest obstacle to obtain images that only retain information about settlements comes from biomass burning. Biomass burning emits light at night, which can be captured by sensors; thus, it cannot be visually distinguished in a direct manner from the light related to settlements in nighttime light data. The biomass burning signal is usually separated from the settlement signal by the “masking” or by the “threshold” filtering method. Since the biomass burning nighttime radiance often exceeds 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1, the threshold value must be higher than that. It should be noted that the nighttime light radiance of many small settlements might be less than 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1, especially in developing regions; thus, the “threshold” method inevitably filters out useful information on nighttime light related to human settlements. The lower spatial and radiometric resolution of DMSP data limits the application of this method."

Biomass burning light is separated from settlement light taking into account the relatively short duration of biomass burning events. The method is demonstrated by generating a new 2016 annual image to better capture anthropic information."

Three auxiliary datasets were applied in this study to evaluate the new annual nighttime light image generated in this study, including the Sentinel-2 prototype Land Cover 20 m 2016 map of Africa released by the European Space Agency (ESA-S2-AFRICA-LC20), the global land-cover and land-use reference data derived from the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing platform, and high-resolution Google Earth images."

Settlement lights were effectively separated from biomass burning lights, in addition to capturing the seasonality of biomass burning. We show that the new 2016 nighttime light image can very effectively identify even small settlements, notwithstanding their fragmentation and unstable power supply. We found that the new annual nighttime light data performed best among the three datasets in capturing settlements, with a high recognition rate of 61.8%, and absolute superiority for settlements of 2.5 square kilometers or less. This shows that the method separates biomass burning signals very effectively, while retaining the relatively stable, although dim, lights of small settlements.

                "AnswerEn": "The biggest obstacle to obtaining images that only retain information about settlements comes from biomass burning. Biomass burning emits light at night, which can be captured by sensors and cannot be visually distinguished in a direct manner from the light related to settlements in nighttime light data. The biomass burning signal is usually separated from the settlement signal by the 'masking' or by the 'threshold' filtering method. However, since the biomass burning nighttime radiance often exceeds 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1, the threshold value must be higher than that. The nighttime light radiance of many small settlements might be less than 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1, particularly in developing regions, making the 'threshold' method filter out useful information on nighttime light related to human settlements.",
                "AnswerCn": "获取仅保留有关人类聚落信息的图像的最大障碍来自生物质燃烧。生物质燃烧在夜间发出光，这些光可以被传感器捕捉，并且在夜间光数据中无法以直接方式与与聚落相关的光进行区分。生物质燃烧信号通常通过“掩膜”或“阈值”过滤方法与聚落信号分离。然而，由于生物质燃烧的夜间辐射通常超过 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1，因此阈值必须高于该值。许多小型聚落的夜间光辐射可能低于 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1，特别是在发展中国家，这使得“阈值”方法过滤掉与人类聚落相关的有用夜间光信息。",

This method considers the relatively short duration of biomass burning events to separate them from settlement lights. Using this method, a new 2016 annual image was generated that significantly improves the identification of small settlements, even those with fragmented and unstable power supplies. The new annual nighttime light data performed best in capturing settlements, with a high recognition rate of 61.8%, particularly excelling in identifying settlements of 2.5 square kilometers or less.",
