            "description": "This dataset is a global high-accuracy elevation control point dataset, containing information on geographic positioning, elevation, and acquisition time of each elevation control point. The accuracy of laser altimetry data from the ICESat-2 satellite is affected by many factors, such as atmospheric conditions, payload instrument noise, and detection target terrain undulation, resulting in uncertainty in accuracy. This dataset was generated by filtering the 2019 full-year altimetric observations from ICESat-2 satellites. The filtering method is based on a comprehensive evaluation of quality labels with redundant observation constraints. This dataset is for providing high-accuracy global elevation control points for topographic mapping or other scientific fields that rely on good elevation information. The elevation control points were verified that the elevation accuracy of flat (slope < 2°), hilly (2° ≤ slope < 6°), and mountainous (6° ≤ slope < 25°) areas meet the accuracy requirements of 0.5 m, 0.7 m, and 1.5 m, respectively.",
