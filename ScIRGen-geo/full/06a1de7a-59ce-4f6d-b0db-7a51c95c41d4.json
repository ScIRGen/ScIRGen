            "description": "Based on the meteorological data of 105 meteorological stations in and around the Qinghai Tibet Plateau from 1980 to 2019, the National Meteorological Science Data Center of China Meteorological Administration (CMA) was established. By calculating the oxygen content, it is found that there is a significant linear correlation between oxygen content and altitude, y = - 0.0263x + 283.8, R2 = 0.9819. Therefore, the oxygen content distribution map can be calculated based on DEM data grid. Due to the limitation of the natural environment in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, there are few related fixed-point observation institutions. This data can reflect the distribution of oxygen content in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau to a certain extent, and has certain reference significance for the research of human living environment in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
