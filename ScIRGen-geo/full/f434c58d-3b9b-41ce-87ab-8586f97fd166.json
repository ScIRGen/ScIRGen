            "description": "The Tibetan Plateau is known as “The World’s Third Pole” and “The Water Tower of Asia”. A relatively accurate map of the frozen soil in the Tibetan Plateau is therefore significant for local cold region engineering and environmental construction. Thus, to meet the engineering and environmental needs, a decision tree was established based on multi-source remote sensing data (elevation, MODIS surface temperature, vegetation index and soil moisture) to divide the permafrost and seasonally frozen soil of the Tibetan Plateau. The data are in grid format, DN=1 stands for permafrost, and DN=2 stands for seasonally frozen soil.\nThe elevation data are from the 1 km x 1 km China DEM (digital elevation model) data set (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn); the surface temperature is the yearly average data based on daily data estimated by Bin Ouyang and others using the Sin-Linear method. The estimation of the daily average surface temperature was based on the application of the Sin-Linear method to MODIS surface products, and to reduce the time difference with existing frozen soil maps, the surface temperature of the study area in 2003 was used as the information source for the classification of frozen soil. Vegetation information was extracted from the 16-day synthetic product data of Aqua and Terra (MYD13A1 and MOD13A1) in 2003. Soil moisture values were obtained from relatively high-quality ascending pass data collected by AMSR-E in May 2003. Therefore, based on the above data, the classification threshold of the decision tree was obtained using the Map of Frozen Soil in the Tibetan Plateau (1:3000000) and Map of the Glaciers, Frozen Soil and Deserts in China (1:4000000) as the a priori information. Based on the prosed method, the frozen soil types on the Tibetan Plateau were classified.\nThe classification results were then verified and compared with the surveyed maps of frozen soil in the West Kunlun Mountains, revised maps, maps of hot springs and other existing frozen soil maps related to the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the Tibetan Plateau frozen soil map generated from the multi-source remote sensing information, the permafrost area accounts for 42.5% (111.3 × 104 km²), and the seasonally frozen soil area accounts for 53.8% (140.9 × 104 km²) of the total area of the Tibetan Plateau. This result is relatively consistent with the prior map (the 1:3000000 Map of Frozen Soil in the Tibetan Plateau). In addition, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the different frozen soil maps show that the frozen soil maps compiled or simulated by different methods are basically consistent in terms of the spatial distribution pattern, and the inconsistencies are mainly in the boundary areas between permafrost areas and seasonally frozen soil areas.",

                "When studying the human settlement process, it is of great significance to understand the prehistoric environment, economy and society by exploring the human–land relationship and the evolution of civilization reflected by the settlement environment. This research provides a reference for the process, representation, driving mode, and research ideas of early human settlement preferences. As the spatial relics of early human activities, settlement sites carry and record information about early human adaptation and transformation of the environment, interpreting and revealing the environmental information of settlement distribution can provide conditions for further understanding the interaction between humans and the environment during this period. Attempts to explain the relationships among prehistoric human settlement information, the development of early civilizations, and the natural environment date back to the 1950s. Currently, the preference for human settlement in China is mainly based on the geographical and environmental characteristics of site distribution, and the natural environment preference of prehistoric settlement sites in different regions and periods has been explored. The current research on the prehistoric culture in the region has discussed cultural exchanges, livelihood patterns, climate and environmental change processes and their impacts of prehistoric humans, but there have been fewer studies of behavioural preferences in settlement selection, and more emphasis has been placed on interpreting the decisive impact of the environment on human beings.",
                "The settlement preference system is the product of human practice in the human–earth system, including the natural environment preference at the material level and the social and cultural preferences at the nonmaterial level. From the perspective of human factors, there are needs such as early natural worship, livelihood forms, external transportation, tribal inheritance, security and defence, group cognitive guidance, cultural integration and diffusion, and the emergence of rights organizations. In terms of natural environmental factors, there are physical needs in the settlement process, such as suitability of topography and geomorphology, liveable climatic conditions, high biodiversity, proximity to water sources, a moderate number of vegetation types and moderate vegetation coverage, good soil fertility, abundant sunlight, a relatively low likelihood of disasters and suitable elevations. The study of the relationship between early human settlement and the geographical background is a key aspect of research on early human activities, covering the relationships of settlement activities with topography, the water system, regional structure, soil, climate and many other factors. The availability of water sources is an essential factor for human survival. The influence of elevation on human beings involves many factors, such as atmospheric physics, geochemistry and ecology. The spatial connection between the two is the strongest, and settlement activity is the most likely to produce cultural preferences. The essence of this settlement cluster behaviour lies in the development of productivity. Humans have progressed from fishing and hunting to farming.",
                "Early human settlement activities in Xinjiang showed different preferences for natural environmental and social environmental conditions in different periods. Climate change and livelihood patterns had significant impact on settlement preferences as settlement activities adapted to and remodelled changes in the natural environment. The cultural preference for settlement activities was strong, and the human initiative factor was the main controlling factor. Early human settlement was affected by strong geographical conditions, such as rivers, slopes, the elevation and other factors. Referring to Zhu et al.'s simulation method of early human traffic routes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this paper uses ArcGIS hydrological analysis and other tools to simulate the traffic routes in Xinjiang to analyse the impact of traffic factors on settlement activities and to interpret the traffic preferences of early human settlement. Thiessen Polygons is a space segmentation method that seamlessly divides the plane space according to the known point set. The Maxent model is the realization of the maximum entropy theory."

                "This paper explores the natural and social environmental preferences of early human settlements in Xinjiang, China, from the Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age (45 ka BP–2250 a BP). Based on the settlement preference characteristics, the Maxent model is used to predict the settlements in different periods to further understand the evolution of civilization in Xinjiang, to understand the relationship between the early human settlement process and the natural and social environment; and to provide a reference for the excavation and protection of sites in subsequent steps.",
                "We believe that settlement needs and environmental conditions gradually formed a relatively stable and progressive interactive relationship in the process of adaptation and transformation. Therefore, it is necessary to use the natural environmental conditions that affect the distribution of settlement sites as simulation factors to identify traffic routes as comprehensively as possible."

            "challenges": [
                "However, the regionally distinct and asynchronous results revealed by different temporal and spatial scales suggest that case studies from more perspectives are needed to help us to understand the epochal characteristics and variability of human settlement in human–land interaction systems.",
                "Currently, there is no uniform classification standard for the distance from human settlements to rivers in early stages. The alternation of cold and warm climatic conditions, dry and wet changes, and changes in topography have caused rivers to form, disappear, and change. Therefore, the distribution of modern rivers might not reflect the distribution of rivers in earlier periods.",
                "Due to the lack of written records, high-precision map records and road sites, the early traffic routes in most regions remain unclear. Although we can deduce the early lines from the existing settlement sites, this inversion is bound to be affected by the excavation of settlement sites. The traffic routes in the settlement distribution areas that have completely disappeared and have not been excavated cannot be effectively identified, and the accuracy of traffic route identification is affected."

Therefore, this paper uses the hydrology tool set in ArcGIS software to extract the potential rivers in Xinjiang. Since the river extraction process changes with the size of the raster calculator extraction threshold, this paper sets the threshold to 200,000 after attempting and integrating the extracted rivers with the data from modern rivers to simulate all possible rivers. Guided by the idea of constructing the resistance surface in the minimum resistance model, this paper simulates the early human traffic routes in Xinjiang with the early traffic route simulation method developed by Zhu et al. The resistance surface of the simulation factors was constructed, and the resistance level was divided. The Maxent model was used to predict the locations of settlements in the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Ages.",
                "In this study, the name, longitude and latitude coordinates, cultural relic category, age, time, area, protection level and other information on the site were collected, and GIS data on the sites were obtained through ArcGIS vector transformation. Based on the above data, ArcGIS10.2 software was used to extract and produce data on the elevation, slope, water system, slope, slope direction, soil type and landform type for each site. In this paper, the maximum entropy distribution is obtained using the settlement data as a constraint condition and the environmental impact background of the settlement distribution as a variable. The prediction results of the model were tested by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The final results were loaded into ArcGIS software to visualize the settlement distribution probability map."

For settlement prediction in different periods, Maxent performs well in terms of practicability, but the proportion of test data affects the prediction accuracy."
