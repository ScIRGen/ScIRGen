            "description": "The data set contains annual NPP-VIIRS night time light data images of equatorial northern Africa and the Sahel region from 2013 to 2020. Based on the monthly average night time light image data of visible infrared imaging radiometer Suite (VIIRS) of national polar orbiting partnership (NPP) satellite, this dataset is generated by separating the unstable night light caused by biomass combustion from the stable night light information caused by human activities. The spatial resolution of the data is 500 m, and the grid data type is GeoTIFF. The grid pixel value is radiance, and the unit is 10 − 9 w ∙ cm − 2 ∙ SR − 1. The data set improves the ability of noctilucent images to identify small-scale, scattered and unstable urban information in northern equatorial Africa and Sahel to a certain extent, and can be further applied to the research on human activities in northern equatorial Africa and Sahel.",

                "Observing and understanding changes in Africa is a hotspot in global ecological environmental research since the early 1970s. As possible causes of environmental degradation, frequent droughts and human activities attracted wide attention. Remote sensing of nighttime light provides an effective way to map human activities and assess their intensity. Nighttime light is a good indicator of human activity. Satellite-borne imaging radiometers capture accurate nighttime light data, thus providing the opportunity to study the nighttime light quantitatively in large areas. Low power penetration affects the northern Equatorial Africa and Sahel region, where power cuts occur frequently. The electricity deficit is one of the main problems in the development of this region. The visible near-infrared (VNIR) image data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) are widely used to capture stable nighttime light. More recent data acquired by the National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) were applied for the same purpose. Compared to DMSP-OLS, NPP-VIIRS has the advantages of higher spatial resolution (about 742 m) and on-board calibration, and it is not affected by saturation and has a higher dim light sensitivity. Earlier studies on the detection and characterization of human settlements using nighttime light data relied on the estimation of an optimal threshold on radiance according to reference data, on using ancillary data, and on change detection."

                "The aim of this study was to propose a better way to extract information about human activities in northern Equatorial Africa and Sahel from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) monthly nighttime light data. The objective of this study was to provide a new method (i.e., the patches filtering method, PFM) for filtering NPP-VIIRS monthly nighttime light data to improve the ability to identify small settlements, including small and scattered ones, which required the separation of stable nighttime lights associated with settlements from unstable nighttime lights due to biomass burning."
            ],
            "challenges": [
                "The biggest obstacle to obtain images that only retain information about settlements comes from biomass burning. Biomass burning emits light at night, which can be captured by sensors; thus, it cannot be visually distinguished in a direct manner from the light related to settlements in nighttime light data. The biomass burning signal is usually separated from the settlement signal by the “masking” or by the “threshold” filtering method. Since the biomass burning nighttime radiance often exceeds 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1, the threshold value must be higher than that. It should be noted that the nighttime light radiance of many small settlements might be less than 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1, especially in developing regions; thus, the “threshold” method inevitably filters out useful information on nighttime light related to human settlements. The lower spatial and radiometric resolution of DMSP data limits the application of this method."

                "In this study, we developed the patches filtering method (i.e., PFM), a new method to separate unstable nighttime light induced by biomass burning from stable nighttime light in NPP-VIIRS monthly nighttime light data. Biomass burning light is separated from settlement light taking into account the relatively short duration of biomass burning events. The method is demonstrated by generating a new 2016 annual image to better capture anthropic information."

The NPP-VIIRS 2016 annual nighttime light image from the NCEI was taken as a reference to evaluate the new annual image and its capability to identify the settlements in the study area. Three auxiliary datasets were applied in this study to evaluate the new annual nighttime light image generated in this study, including the Sentinel-2 prototype Land Cover 20 m 2016 map of Africa released by the European Space Agency (ESA-S2-AFRICA-LC20), the global land-cover and land-use reference data derived from the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing platform, and high-resolution Google Earth images."

                "The results show that PFM is useful for improving the quality of NPP-VIIRS monthly nighttime light data. Settlement lights were effectively separated from biomass burning lights, in addition to capturing the seasonality of biomass burning. We show that the new 2016 nighttime light image can very effectively identify even small settlements, notwithstanding their fragmentation and unstable power supply. We found that the new annual nighttime light data performed best among the three datasets in capturing settlements, with a high recognition rate of 61.8%, and absolute superiority for settlements of 2.5 square kilometers or less. This shows that the method separates biomass burning signals very effectively, while retaining the relatively stable, although dim, lights of small settlements. The new 2016 annual image demonstrates good performance in identifying human settlements in sparsely populated areas toward a better understanding of human activities."

                    "Answer": "The difficulty arises because the biomass burning nighttime radiance often exceeds certain thresholds, while the nighttime light radiance of many small settlements might be less, especially in developing regions.

Biomass burning emits light at night, which can be captured by sensors and cannot be visually distinguished in a direct manner from the light related to settlements in nighttime light data. The biomass burning signal is usually separated from the settlement signal by the 'masking' or by the 'threshold' filtering method.

The nighttime light radiance of many small settlements might be less than 2 × 10−9 W·cm−2·sr−1, particularly in developing regions, making the 'threshold' method filter out useful information on nighttime light related to human settlements.",
