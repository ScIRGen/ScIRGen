            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Qinghai Lake integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of the Subalpine shrub from January 1 to October 13, 2021. The site (100°6'3.62\"E, 37°31'15.67\") was located in the subalpine shrub ecosystem, near the Gangcha County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3495m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP155; 3, 5 and 10 m, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (windsonic; 3, 5 and 10 m, towards north), air pressure (PTB110; 3 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 2 m of the platform in west by north of tower), four-component radiometer (CNR4; 6m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, towards south, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (PQS1; 6 m, towards south, each with one vertically downward and one vertically upward, soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates below the vegetation; -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (109; -0.05、-0.10、-0.20、-0.40、-0.80、-1.20、-2.00、-3.00 and -4.00m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.05、-0.10、-0.20、-0.40、-0.80、-1.20、-2.00、-3.00 and -4.00m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_3 m, Ta_5 m, and Ta_10 m; RH_3 m, RH_5 m, and RH_10 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_3 m, Ws_5 m, and Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_3 m, WD_5 m and WD_10 m) (°), precipitation (rain) (mm), air pressure (press) (hpa), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_D_up and PAR_D_down) (μmol/ (s m-2)), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_5cm、Ts_10cm、Ts_20cm、Ts_40cm、Ts_80cm、Ts_120cm、Ts_200cm、Ts_300cm、Ts_500cm) (℃), soil moisture (Ms_5cm、Ms_10cm、Ms_20cm、Ms_40cm、Ms_80cm、Ms_120cm、Ms_200cm、Ms_300cm、Ms_500cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018/8/31 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.",

Additionally, devices such as barometers, rain gauges, four-component radiometers, and infrared thermometers are employed to record atmospheric pressure, precipitation, surface radiation temperature, and radiation balance. Soil temperature and moisture are measured at various depths ranging from 5cm to 500cm. The collection process ensures the acquisition of data every 10 minutes, with quality control measures in place to manage missing data, remove duplicate records, and identify questionable data.",
