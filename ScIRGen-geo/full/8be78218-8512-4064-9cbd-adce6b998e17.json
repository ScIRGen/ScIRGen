            "description": "The dataset of surface roughness measurements was obtained in No. 1 and 2 quadrates of the Biandukou foci experimental area during the pre-observation period. Both the quadrates were divided into 3×3 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. The original photos of each sampling point, surface height standard deviation (cm) and correlation length (cm) were included. With the roughness grid board 110cm long and the measuring  intervals of 1cm, the samples were collected along the  soil surface from south to north and from east to west, respectively.\n     The coordinates of sample points would be got with the help of ArcView; and after geometric correction, surface height standard deviation (cm) and correlation length (cm) could be acquired based on the formula listed on pages 234-236, Microwave Remote Sensing, Vol. II.\n     The roughness data files were initialized by the sample name, which was followed by the serial number, the name of the file, standard deviation and correlation length. Each .txt file is matched with one sample photo and standard deviation and correlation length represent the roughness. In addition, the length of 101 needles is also included for further checking.\n     Those provide reliable ground data for improving and verifying the microwave remote sensing algorithms.",

Measurements are conducted in both north-south and east-west directions using a roughness board 110 cm long with a 1 cm interval between measurement points. Each location consists of a 3Grid×3Grid pattern, with each Grid being 30m×30m. Images are digitized manually in ArcView software by identifying the top of each spoke and the corners of the board to obtain image coordinate values. After geometric correction, the height of each spoke is calculated, followed by the computation of surface height standard deviation and correlation length using specific formulas. The resulting data includes the standard deviation and correlation length (in cm), which represent roughness, and lengths of 101 spokes per photo for calibration purposes. This data is essential for microwave remote sensing algorithm development and validation.",
