            "description": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in the study of surface energy balance. It is widely used in the fields of meteorology, climate, hydrology, agriculture and ecology. As an important means to obtain global and regional scale LST information, satellite (thermal infrared) remote sensing is vulnerable to the influence of cloud cover and other atmospheric conditions, resulting in temporal and spatial discontinuity of LST remote sensing products, which greatly limits the application of LST remote sensing products in related research fields.\nThe preparation of this data set is based on the empirical orthogonal function interpolation method, using Terra / Aqua MODIS surface temperature products to reconstruct the lst under ideal clear sky conditions, and then using the cumulative distribution function matching method to fuse era5 land reanalysis data to obtain the lst under all-weather conditions. This method makes full use of the spatio-temporal information of the original MODIS remote sensing products and the cloud impact information in the reanalysis data, alleviates the impact of cloud cover on LST estimation, and finally reconstructs the high-quality global 0.05 ° spatio-temporal continuous ideal clear sky and all-weather LST data set.\nThis data set not only realizes the seamless coverage of space-time, but also has good verification accuracy. The reconstructed ideal clear sky LST data in the experimental areas of 17 land cover types in the world, the average correlation coefficient (R) is 0.971, the bias (bias) is -0.001 K to 0.049 K, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.436 K to 2.688 K. The verification results of the reconstructed all-weather LST data and the measured data of ground stations: the average R is 0.895, the bias is 0.025 K to 2.599 K, and the RMSE is 4.503 K to 7.299 K.\nThe time resolution of this data set is 4 times a day, the spatial resolution is 0.05 °, the time span is 2002-2022, and the spatial range covers the world.",

However, this category of algorithms works only under clear-sky conditions; thus, when affected by clouds or other atmospheric disturbances, an MODIS LST product may possess large proportions of missing data, which greatly limits the application of MODIS LST products. However, the abovementioned methods can only reconstruct the missing LST values under ideal, clear-sky conditions but cannot construct real LSTs under cloudy sky conditions. However, some of these methods need to calculate regional parameters from ground-based measurements, and some are not effective when larger areas of data are missing, so they are difficult to apply to LST reconstruction at large scales from global perspectives."
