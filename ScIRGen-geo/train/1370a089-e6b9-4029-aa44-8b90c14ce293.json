            "titleEn": "Qilian Mountains integrated observatory network: Dataset of Heihe integrated observatory network (an cosmic-ray observation system of soil moisture of Daman Superstation, 2018)",
            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from a Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System for soil moisture observation at the Daman Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2018. The site (100.372° E, 38.856° N) was located on a cropland (maize surface) in the Daman irrigation area, which is near Zhangye city, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1556 m. The bottom of the probe was 0.5 m above the ground; the sampling interval was 1 hour.\nThe raw COSMOS data include the following variables: battery (Batt, V), temperature (T, C), relative humidity (RH, %), air pressure (P, hPa), fast neutron counts (N1C, counts per hour), thermal neutron counts (N2C, counts per hour), sample time of fast neutrons (N1ET, s), and sample time of thermal neutrons (N2ET, s). The distributed data include the following variables: Date, Time, P, N1C, N1C_cor (corrected fast neutron counts) and VWC (volume soil moisture, %), which were processed as follows:\n1) Data were removed and replaced by -6999 when (a) the battery voltage was less than 11.8 V, (b) the relative humidity was greater than 80% inside the probe box, (c) the counting data were not of one-hour duration and (d) neutron count differed from the previous value by more than 20%; 2) An air pressure correction was applied to the quality-controlled raw data according to the equation contained in the equipment manual; 3) After the quality control and corrections were applied, soil moisture was calculated using the equation in Zreda et al. (2012), where N0 is the neutron counts above dry soil and the other variables are fitted constants that define the shape of the calibration function. Here, the parameter N0 was calibrated using the in situ observed soil moisture by SoilNET within the footprint; 4) Based on the calibrated N0 and corrected N1C, the hourly soil moisture was computed using the equation from the equipment manual. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Zhu et al. (2015) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of surface process observation networks, a 'cosmic ray observation system' refers to the equipment and methodologies used to measure cosmic ray fluxes, such as fast and thermal neutrons, at specific observation sites. This system involves instruments with probes placed at a certain height above the ground, which collect data on variables like voltage, temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, and neutron counts. The system is used to derive further insights, such as soil moisture content, through data processing techniques like pressure correction and instrument calibration.",

                    "Answer": "The method involves correcting fast neutron counts for atmospheric pressure variations, which suggests that soil moisture variability is sensitive to atmospheric conditions. The pressure-corrected fast neutron counts (N1C_cor) are used to compute soil volumetric water content (VWC), indicating that accurate atmospheric pressure correction is crucial for reliable soil moisture estimation. The process implies that atmospheric pressure has a significant impact on neutron counts, requiring precise correction to discern true soil moisture changes.",

                    "Answer": "Excluding data points based on criteria such as voltage, humidity, sampling time, and neutron count variation can enhance the reliability and accuracy of the dataset by removing potential outliers and errors. This can lead to more accurate calculations of soil moisture and other derived variables, as the remaining data is more likely to reflect true environmental conditions. However, it may also result in the loss of potentially valuable information if the exclusion criteria are too strict or if patterns exist in the excluded data that are not captured by the remaining dataset. It is essential to balance data quality and quantity to ensure meaningful analysis.",

These formulas adjust the raw fast neutron count data to account for changes in atmospheric pressure, resulting in the corrected fast neutron count N1C_cor.",
