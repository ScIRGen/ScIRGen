This datasets presents a long-term (~ 10 years) SMST profile dataset collected from the Tibet-Obs, which includes the original in situ measurements at a 15 min interval collected between 2008 and 2019 from all the three networks and the spatially upscaled data for the Maqu and Shiquanhe networks.",

                "Soil moisture and soil temperature (SMST) are important state variables for quantifying water, energy, and carbon exchange processes in the soil–vegetation–atmosphere system. Quantifying the seasonal dynamics and trend changes in the SMST is important for understanding the response of hydrological cycle and vegetation dynamics to climate change. Known as the third pole, the exchange of water and energy between land and atmosphere on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a crucial role in regulating climate processes in the Northern Hemisphere and the evolution of the Asian monsoon. The soil freeze–thaw (F/T) cycle is a typical process on the TP, which has a significant impact on the energy exchange between land and atmosphere and water cycle. However, SMST monitoring networks are scarce on the TP compared to its vast territory, and even fewer exist with long time series measurements and/or with measurements at multiple soil depths. To our knowledge, there are only two operational SMST observatories that provide long-term measurements at multiple soil depths on the TP, i.e. Tibet-Obs (Tibetan Plateau observatory of plateau-scale SMST) and CTP-SMTMN (soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central TP)."

Comparisons between the long-term upscaled data and five reanalysis datasets, including the ECMWF reanalysis v5 (ERA5), Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), Global Land Data Assimilation System version 2 Catchment Land Surface Model (GLDAS-2.1 CLSM), GLDAS-2.1 Noah, and GLDAS-2.1 variable infiltration capacity (GLDAS-2.1 VIC), indicate that none of the current model-based products can reproduce the seasonal variations and interannual trend changes in the measured SMST profile dynamics in both networks."

                    "Answer": "The scarcity of SMST monitoring networks on the Tibetan Plateau is primarily due to its vast territory, which makes it challenging to establish and maintain extensive monitoring systems. This limitation affects data collection by restricting the availability of long-term measurements at multiple soil depths, which are critical for understanding seasonal dynamics and trends in soil moisture and temperature.",

                    "Answer": "Current model-based products fail to accurately simulate these dynamics because they underestimate soil temperature changes at every depth, leading to an earlier onset of freezing and a later onset of thawing. This inadequacy indicates that these models cannot adequately simulate winter conditions on the Tibetan Plateau, highlighting a gap in capturing the true seasonal and interannual variations.",

                    "Answer": "The need for upscaled data arises from the requirement to extend the insights from point measurements to broader spatial scales. This necessity is driven by the limited spatial coverage of in situ sensors and the complexity of capturing diverse climatic conditions across the Tibetan Plateau, which requires upscaling to better evaluate model-based SMST products over a long-term period.",

This is particularly important in the Tibetan Plateau due to its significant role in regulating climate processes and the energy exchange between land and atmosphere.",
