            "description": "Sediment ancient DNA is biological ancient DNA scattered in Paleoenvironmental samples, which is different from ancient DNA directly extracted from ancient animal bones and plant remains. Paleoenvironmental DNA is mainly mixed with multi species ancient DNA extracted from environmental samples such as glaciers, frozen soil, lake sediments, peat sediments, site cultural layer, dental calculus and fecal fossils. These DNA enter the environment with biological residues (including remains, hair, feces and urine), degrade rapidly and denature slowly in the environment, and finally adsorb on minerals and other particles or integrate into their own genome by microorganisms for long-term preservation, thus forming paleoenvironmental DNA. Sediment DNA is a new ancient DNA analysis technology. The sediments of archaeological sites can track the DNA preservation status of relevant sites and possible humans, make up for the shortcomings that human fossils are generally available but not available, greatly expand the research object and open a new window to study the population evolution of Paleolithic archaeological sites. The ancient DNA of stratum sediments from baishiya karst cave site where Xiahe human mandible was found was systematically sampled and analyzed.",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method used to analyze sedimentary ancient DNA in an archaeological cave site involves systematically sampling and analyzing the stratified layers of sediment in a site like the Baishiya Karst Cave. This method focuses on extracting mixed ancient DNA from environmental samples such as glacial deposits, lake sediments, peat, cultural layers, dental calculus, and coprolites. The DNA collected reflects various biological remnants, including bodies, hair, feces, and urine, which are degraded and adsorbed onto mineral particles or integrated into microbial genomes.",

                    "Answer": "Sediment ancient DNA refers to the biological ancient DNA dispersed in ancient environmental samples, distinct from ancient DNA extracted directly from ancient animal bones or plant remains. It is primarily obtained from environmental samples such as glaciers, permafrost, lake sediments, peat sediments, archaeological site cultural layers, dental calculus, and fossilized feces. This DNA enters the environment through biological residues, including bodies, hair, feces, and urine, and undergoes rapid degradation and slow denaturation, eventually adsorbing onto mineral particles or integrating into microbial genomes for long-term preservation. Sediment DNA is a novel ancient DNA analysis technique that can track the DNA preservation status at archaeological sites and potentially identify human presence, supplementing the often scarce human fossils and significantly expanding research subjects, thereby opening a new window for studying human evolution at Paleolithic archaeological sites.",
