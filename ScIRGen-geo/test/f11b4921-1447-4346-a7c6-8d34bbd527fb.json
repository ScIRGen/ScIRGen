            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Daman Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2021. The site (100.372° E, 38.856° N) was located on a cropland (maize surface) in the Daman irrigation, which is near Zhangye city, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1556 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (AV-14TH;3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (windsonic; 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 m, towards north), air pressure (CS100; 2 m), rain gauge (TE525M; 2.5 m, 8 m in west of tower), four-component radiometer (PIR&PSP; 12 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (IRTC3; 12 m, towards south, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (LI190SB; 12 m, towards south, vertically upward; another four photosynthetically active radiation, PQS-1; two above the plants (12 m) and two below the plants (0.3 m), towards south, each with one vertically downward and one vertically upward), soil heat flux (HFP01SC; 3 duplicates with G1 below the vegetation; G2 and G3 between plants, -0.06 m), a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (TCAV; -0.02, -0.04 m), soil temperature profile (AV-10T; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_3 m, Ta_5 m, Ta_10 m, Ta_15 m, Ta_20 m, Ta_30 m, and Ta_40 m; RH_3 m, RH_5 m, RH_10 m, RH_15 m, RH_20 m, RH_30 m, and RH_40 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_3 m, Ws_5 m, Ws_10 m, Ws_15 m, Ws_20 m, Ws_30 m, and Ws_40 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_3 m, WD_5 m, WD_10 m, WD_15 m, WD_20 m, WD_30m, and WD_40 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (μmol/ (s m-2)), average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, below the vegetation; Gs_2, and Gs_3, between plants) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content), above the plants photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_U_up and PAR_U_down) (μmol/ (s m-2)), and below the plants photosynthetically active radiation of upward and downward (PAR_D_up and PAR_D_down) (μmol/ (s m-2)).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The soil data during May 15 to June 12 were wrong due to the power loss. TCAV data were missing due to the malfunction of TCAV probe. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2021-6-10 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
                "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
                "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

In addition, the soil and canopy sensible heat fluxes were estimated using the series TSEB model, and their latent heat fluxes were calculated while solving the energy balance equations (1) and (2), respectively. The soil and canopy component temperatures were calculated using the images obtained with the thermal camera. To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities. Next, the simulated radiometric temperatures were validated against the surface radiometric temperatures, which were calculated according to the incoming long-wave radiation observed by the four-component radiometer."

In addition, the model exhibited relatively reliable estimates in the latent heat flux, with mean bias and RMSE values of 31 and 61 W·m−2, respectively, compared with the measurements from the EC system. These results demonstrated that a robust soil and vegetation component temperature calculation was crucial for estimating E, T, and ET. Moreover, the separate validation of E/ET% and T/ET% provides a good prospect for TSEB model improvements.",
                "Our results demonstrated that the TSEB model using soil and canopy component radiometric temperatures, which were obtained from a high-precision thermal infrared camera, can be applied in a strongly advection-irrigated agricultural area. Notably, the results illustrated that the latent fluxes of the soil and vegetation components were successfully separated with reasonable accuracy, as assessed using ground-based measurements. The estimated E/ET% and E/ET% values agreed well with the values observed using the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes technique during the early, middle, and late growing seasons. In addition, the TSEB model produced reliable estimations of Rn, H, and LE; the mean biases of Rn, H, and LE were −18, 5, and 31 W ·m−2, respectively, and the RMSEs of Rn, H, and LE were 29, 19, and 61 W · m−2, respectively. This finding suggests that given accurate soil and vegetation component temperatures, E and T can be accurately separated from ET using the TSEB model."

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods in oasis–desert ecosystems involve a combination of long-term energy, water vapor, carbon, and methane flux measurements using an eddy covariance system and scintillometer. Additionally, hydrometeorological data such as radiation, soil heat flux, soil temperature profiles, and gradients of air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction are collected using automatic weather stations with a 10-minute average period. Vegetation and soil parameters are also supplemented to support comprehensive analysis.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in estimating surface fluxes include incomplete energy balance closure in eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements, uncertainty in surface-air temperature differences, errors in surface soil and vegetation component temperature determination, and strong advective conditions affecting measurement accuracy. Image classification errors and ignoring atmospheric factors can also introduce uncertainties, particularly in the estimation of soil and canopy component temperatures.",

These datasets consist of half-hourly turbulent flux data, hydrometeorological observations, and auxiliary data on vegetation and soil parameters from 2012 to 2021. The data are collected from multiple stations, including superstations and ordinary stations, and are available from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center.",
