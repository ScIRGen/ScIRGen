            "description": "The Huanghuang Valley was one of the most important agricultural development areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, especially by the Qing Dynasty, the land cover of the area underwent significant changes. By collating and correcting the 1726 cropland data recorded in the historical documents of the area, with a view to revealing the basic conditions of arable land changes and human activities in the typical river valley agricultural area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we provide a theoretical basis. This data contains raster data on the spatial distribution pattern of arable land in the Huanghuang Valley in 1726 with a spatial resolution of 1km*1km. The area of cropland is mainly obtained from the New Records of Xining Prefecture，Records of Xuanhua Hall，New Records of Gansu， which were recorded during the Qianlong period of 20 years.  The determination of county administrative boundaries refers to Atlas of Chinese History edited by Tan Qixiang and Comprehensive Table of Administrative Region Evolution in Qing Dynasty edited by Niu Hanping. The original data on cropland collected from the historical literature was corrected and then the quantitative data was assigned to space using a grid drawing method.",

                    "Answer": "The 'spatial distribution pattern' refers to the arrangement and organization of farmland areas across a specific geographic region as represented in a dataset. In the context of historical farmland data collection, it involves converting historical land data into a standardized modern unit and using a grid model to spatialize the data, providing a visual representation of farmland distribution in terms of location and density across the region.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution pattern of cultivated land in the Hehuang Valley in 1726 could have been influenced by several factors, including changes in land cover due to increased agricultural activities during the Qing Dynasty, as well as human activities documented in historical literature such as the 'Xining Fu Xinzhi', 'Xunhua Ting Zhi', and 'Gansu Xintong Zhi'. Additionally, the administrative boundaries defined in historical maps, such as those in the 'Historical Atlas of China', may have played a role in shaping these distribution patterns.",

                    "Answer": "Transforming historical land data into modern units and applying a grid-based model for spatial distribution can improve the consistency and comparability of data across different time periods. It provides a structured approach to visualize historical land use patterns, allowing for better analysis of changes over time. However, these transformations may introduce errors if historical data is inaccurately converted or if the grid-based model oversimplifies complex land patterns. The method can enhance the understanding of agricultural development but might also overlook finer details due to its resolution and assumptions.",
