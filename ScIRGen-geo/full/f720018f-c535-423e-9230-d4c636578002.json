            "description": "This data set contains the high-resolution tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column concentration pomino v2.0.1 data in East Asia from 2004 to 2020, which provides an important data basis for studying the spatial distribution characteristics and temporal variation trend of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide in China. Based on the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide slant column concentration provided by KNMI, the pomino tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column concentration is calculated through the tropospheric AMF retrieval algorithm developed by ourselves. The comparison with the ground-based observation data shows that the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column concentration of pomino can better capture the day-to-day variation trend, and has better correlation with the ground-based observation data. At present, the data has been used for scientific research by many universities and scientific research institutions at home and abroad. In the future, the data set will provide more comprehensive data support for scientific research projects on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

Current representative OMI products covering China, DOMINO v2 and OMNO2 v2, do not explicitly account for the effect of aerosols on the solar radiation. Since aerosols affect the radiation field in retrieving both clouds and NO2, the net effect on the retrieved NO2 columns is unclear. This aerosol issue is particularly significant over East China due to its high aerosol loadings. In addition, the DOMINO and OMNO2 products also assume Lambertian surface with no dependence of surface reflectance on the geometry of the light path. DOMINO and OMNO2 adopt the vertical profile of NO2 simulated by coarse-resolution global chemical transport models (CTMs), TM4 at 3° long. × 2° lat. for DOMINO v2 and GMI at 2.5° long. × 2° lat. for OMNO2 v2, which are unable to capture the variability of NO2 at smaller scales."

Our retrieved NO2 columns are 54% of the MAX-DOAS data on average, reflecting the inevitable spatial inconsistency between the two types of measurement, errors in MAX-DOAS data, and uncertainties in our OMI retrieval related to aerosols and vertical profile of NO2."

However, NO2 retrieved from OMI and other spaceborne instruments is subject to errors in the conversion process from radiance to VCD, particularly with respect to the calculation of tropospheric air mass factor (AMF) that is used to convert tropospheric slant column density (SCD) to VCD. Most current-generation NO2 algorithms do not explicitly account for the effects of aerosols on NO2 AMFs and on prerequisite cloud parameter retrievals. In polluted situations with high aerosol loadings and more absorbing aerosol types, which often occur over China and many other developing regions, the implicit method can result in considerable biases. Lin et al. (2014b, 2015) established the POMINO NO2 algorithm, which builds on the DOMINO v2 algorithm (for OMI NO2 slant columns and stratospheric correction), but improves upon it through a more sophisticated AMF calculation over China.

This issue is significant over East China due to high aerosol loadings, which affect the radiation field in retrieving both clouds and NO2, leading to unclear net effects on the retrieved NO2 columns.",
