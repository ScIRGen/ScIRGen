      "description": "This data including the zircon, monazite, garnet and cassiterite U - Pb ages and isotope data, and the geochemical data of the granite in Songshan tin deposite. Samples collected from songshan tin deposit, ore mineral is cassiterite, wall-rocks are biotite monzogranite and granodiorite. Single mineral were selected from the langfang Yuheng technology services company. Cathodoluminescence images and zircon U - Pb ages were finished at the SHRIMP Center at the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Science in Beijing. Monazite garnet, and cassiterite U - Pb ages and isotope dating were tested at the  Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using multiple receive inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA - icp-ms).  All the whole-rock analyses were performed at Activation Laboratories, ltd., Canada. the uncertainties were reported as 95 % confidence limit with high reliability. Data suggest that tin mineralization in the Songshan deposit occurred at the end of Late Cretaceous, which is quite different from the ages of the Pinghejie granitic pluton emplaced. Thus we can concluded that the tin mineralization in the Songshan deposit occurred at the end of Late Cretaceous. It is another important metallogenic period in the Changning tin area.",

        "The Songshan tin deposit is located in the northern Lincang granitic batholith along the Lancangjiang tin belt, Western Yunnan, southwestern China. The ore bodies mainly occur as tourmaline-quartz veins with NNE- and/or NW-trending in the Triassic Pinghejie granitic pluton, and the schist of the Proterozoic Songshan Formation. The previous study suggested the tin mineralization in the Songshan deposit should occur in the Triassic, but no directed age data support it. This hinders the understanding of the genesis of the Songshan tin deposit, especially the tin mineralization in the Lancangjiang tin belt. The zircon Hf isotopes (εHf(t) = – 22 ~ -12) and monazite Nd isotopes (εNd(t) = -13.04 ~ -11.80) indicate that the Pinghejie granitic pluton was derived from the remelting of Paleoproterozoic crust."
