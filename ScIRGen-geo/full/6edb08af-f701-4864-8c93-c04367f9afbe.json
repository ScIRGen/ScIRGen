            "description": "SMOS is the first L-band satellite that observes multi-angular brightness temperature at the globe. It’s very important for monitoring the spatial-temporal distribution of soil moisture. Due to the widespread existence of L-band radio frequency interference (RFI) and the influence of field aliasing caused by two-dimensional synthetic aperture technology, the multi-angular brightness temperatures of SMOS satellite are missing or abnormal to varying degrees. \nThis data set is based on the Level-1C brightness temperature product SCLF1C officially released by ESA, which is stored in a discrete global grid (DGG) with 15-km interval and Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area projection (ISEA) projection mode. The two-step regression method proposed by Zhao et al. was used to optimize or reconstruct the multi-angular brightness temperature data affected by field aliasing and RFI. Then the refined results in DGGs were resampled to the EASE-GRID 2.0 projection (including two grid sizes of 25 km and 36 km) with hamming window approach using a footprint of 43 km.\nWhen applying this dataset to the multi-temporal and multi-angular soil moisture retrieval algorithm, it was found that the accuracy of soil moisture inversion in this dataset is superior to other SMOS brightness temperature products in multiple soil moisture dense observation networks, especially in areas with RFI such as China, where the count of effective retrievals has significantly increased. This dataset will provide more reliable data support for the research and development of L-band land surface parameter products with long time series, such as soil moisture, freeze-thaw state, vegetation moisture, aboveground biomass, snow density, etc.",

In terms of data in the projection of EASE-GRID 2.0, the file names were inherited from the file in ISEA4H9, with resample function and grid size added, for example: in the name of ”SM_REPR_MIR_SCLF1C_A_20210101T002520_20210101T011839_724_320_1_Hamming_25KM.nc”, ”Hamming” represents the resample function name, and “25KM” denotes the grid size. More details can be found in section 4.2 of the user guide. \nUsage method: Data can be read in various programming languages such as MATLAB, Python and IDL, and can also be visualized in hdfview and panoply.

                "Soil moisture acts as a boundary condition for controls on land–atmosphere fluxes of energy and water, and must be accurately represented in hydrology and land surface models. The European Space Agency’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite that was launched in November 2009 is the first spaceborne synthetic aperture passive microwave instrument. It relies on the new 2-D interferometry concept, and could provide global L-band brightness temperature for a range of incidence angles (from 0° to 60°) at a resolution of about 43 km. SMOS provides a unique way for measuring the moisture content at the first few centimeters of soil over land and surface salinity in the ocean. The SMOS soil moisture algorithm is primarily based on the L-band microwave emission of the biosphere (L-MEB) forward model. It uses a decision tree method to select appropriate model elements and parameters according to the auxiliary information that includes land use types. An iterative algorithm is then employed to minimize the difference between the L-MEB model simulations and SMOS multiangle observations. Several surface parameters including vegetation optical depth and soil moisture are retrieved. SMOS algorithm has produced reliable soil moisture based upon several validation studies using sparse networks or extensive field measurements. One of the issues is the uncertainty of the SMOS brightness temperature that is attributed to the radio-frequency interference (RFI) from varied sources and aliasing errors in the Fourier imaging process. Like most microwave sensors, SMOS is also susceptible to RFI, which has significantly affected the quality of brightness temperatures in some regions of the world. Another complicating factor is that the brightness temperature data from the lower look angles are less reliable due to aliasing, which is an inherent problem in interferometry. Another complicating factor when using the brightness temperature data is that the multiple incidence angle observations are not obtained at fixed values. Generally, the case within the sensitivity of the instrument is that the V-pol brightness temperature should be greater than that of the H-pol, and the V-pol brightness temperature generally increases with the incident angle while the H-pol brightness temperature decreases with the incidence angle."

Firstly, TB observations at the antenna frame were filtered with various criteria. As there is no complete dataset for any epoch, a simple first-order spline interpolation was employed to fill the missing acquisitions. Then TBs at antenna level (X, Y) were converted to horizontal (H-) or vertical (V-) polarized TBs at the ground reference frame. Thirdly, a further filter procedure was applied to address potential outliers introduced during the interpolation procedure. The final procedure involves the implementation of the two-step regression approach proposed by Zhao. Following the above procedure, the refined TBs at any incidence angle ranging from 0° to 65° can be calculated with reduced RFI and aliasing effects.

Currently, microwave L-band radiometer is considered an appropriate tool for spatial SM mapping from space due to its strong penetration of vegetation covers and sensitivity to surface SM conditions. Launched by the ESA in 2009, SMOS was the first satellite to operate with a L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer. Numerous validation/evaluation studies of SMOS L2/L3 SM products have been carried out during the last decade and some of them show that the SMOS L2/L3 SM products might present underestimation when compared with ground measurements. Considering the above mentioned issues, the SMOS-IC algorithm was developed by the activities funded by ESA- and CNES aiming at improving SMOS algorithms.

The retrieved MTMA SM shows generally high correlations with in-situ measurements (11 dense observation networks) with overall correlation coefficients of > 0.75.

                "Snow density varies spatially, temporally, and vertically within the snowpack and is the key to converting snow depth to snow water equivalent. Snow cover plays a critical role in terrestrial hydrological, climatological, and ecological processes. It influences the energy balance on the land surface, based on its high albedo and low thermal conductivity. However, when there have been multiple continental or large-scale snow depth remote sensing products, the corresponding snow density product required to convert snow depth to SWE is still limited. At a high frequency, snow volume scattering cannot be neglected. The influences of the snow depth and snow grain size on the brightness temperature (TB) are much higher than that of snow density. Therefore, to estimate snow density, the lower-frequency channel is better suited for its retrieval as it is more sensitive to snow refraction rather than snow volume scattering. The use of a fixed snow density (for example, 240 kg/m3) will result in an overestimated SWE in the early snow season and an underestimated SWE in the late snow season. In recent years, with the development of full-polarized SAR, surface and volume scattering components were extracted from different signal decomposition methods to establish empirical or physical relationships with snow density. After the launch of the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite for soil moisture observation purposes in November 2009, the multiple-angle L-band radiometer became an additional type of sensor applicable for snow density estimation. Preliminary studies on the physical and the practical feasibility of snow density retrieval using ground-based radiometer observations have been conducted. However, if the snow density retrieval algorithm is moved from ground-based to space-borne instruments, it will be challenged by stronger observation noise, emission from other land surface types, and the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from human activities."

Initially, brightness temperature (TB) observations at the antenna frame are filtered with various criteria, and missing acquisitions are filled using first-order spline interpolation. Then, TBs at the antenna level are converted to horizontal or vertical polarized TBs at the ground reference frame. A further filter is applied to address outliers introduced during interpolation.
