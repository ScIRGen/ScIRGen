            "description": "This data set is the structural data of Xuefengshan structural belt in South China, including stratigraphic occurrence, foliation and lineation of metamorphic rocks, and fold axis direction. The data comes from the field measurement of Xuefengshan structural belt in South China. The deformation data of rocks in each structural unit in Xuefengshan structural belt are measured in detail by using geological compass, and the strain parameters are calculated by using Excel indoor, and the solution of strain ellipsoid at each measuring point is finally completed. This data can provide tectonic geological support for the strain heterogeneity in the Xuefengshan tectonic belt and the formation of arc structures in the orogenic belt. The above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored in Excel.",
