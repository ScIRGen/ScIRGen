            "description": "On April 25, 2015, Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake Himalayan main thrust fault zone in the southern Tibet, which caused obvious postseismic deformation in Nepal and southern Tibet. There are a number of work using GPS observation to constrain the rheological properties of the lower crust and upper mantle beneath southern Tibet and Himalaya. This data set summarized these results. The inferred rheological properties of the lithosphere beneath Himalayas and southern Tibet may improve our understanding to the formation and evolution of the Tibetan Plateau and help us assess the seismic hazard of this region.",
