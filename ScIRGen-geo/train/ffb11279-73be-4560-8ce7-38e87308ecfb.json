Each grid shows the ratio of land use type to grid area (0-1). The data comes from the global land use spatial distribution map of the University of Maryland. The historical homogenized land use data of China is obtained by linear interpolation of the original data, extraction of Chinese regional mask and transformation of coordinate system, and saved in geotiff file format. The methods and standards of data over the years are consistent, the coverage is complete, and the collection and processing process is traceable and reliable. It has realized the homogenization of existing population data products, providing a basis for analyzing the laws of human elements, the interaction mechanism of human elements and natural elements.",

                "Anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change activities play a critical role in Earth system dynamics through significant alterations to biogeophysical and biogeochemical properties at local to global scales. Historical land-use activities have been significantly affecting the global carbon budget in both direct and indirect ways and changing Earth’s climate through altering land surface properties (e.g., surface albedo, surface aerodynamic roughness and forest cover). It has been estimated that, during the past 300 years, >50 % of the land surface has been affected by human land-use activities, >25 % of forest has been permanently cleared and 10−44 ×10^6 km^2 of land are recovering from previous human land-use disturbances. Quantiﬁcation of historical land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is important because it serves as the basis for examining the role of human activities in the global carbon budget and the resulting impacts to Earth’s climate system. Considerable efforts have been devoted to modelling historical land-use states and land-use transitions. However, large uncertainties still exist in the carbon/climate studies based on many of the above LULCC products. Standardization of LULCC data is critical for CMIP6 to simplify intercomparison of the ESMs and facilitate model analysis."

                "However, a specific land-use change cannot be unambiguously mapped to a specific land-cover change. However, large uncertainties still exist in the carbon/climate studies based on many of the above LULCC products. For example, the global carbon budget reports that the spread of cumulative LULCC carbon emissions during 1850–2018 estimated by DGVMs are as large as 60 Pg C though all models are forced by the LUH2. LULCC carbon emissions in CMIP5 have an anomalous spike during the years 1950–1960. These anomalous emission estimates by ESMs (hereinafter referred to as the “pasture anomaly”) are caused by an implausible high conversion rate of primary and secondary vegetation to pasture, with the 1950s having double the conversion rate of the 40s or 60s."

The simulated forest cover and vegetation carbon are then compared with multiple published datasets of land-cover, carbon stock and estimates of land-use change emissions. In this study, two key land-cover properties (i.e., forest cover and vegetation carbon) are simulated by combining historical land-use change with translation rules. When land is converted to cropland, managed pasture and/or rangeland, each translation rule indicates that vegetation in primary and secondary may be cleared or remain intact as the result of land-use changes."

Diagnostics of contemporary forest cover consist of six widely used satellite-based land-cover and tree coverage datasets and the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) 2015."

According to the three translation rules, contemporary global forest area is estimated to be 37.42 ×10^6 km^2, within the range derived from remote sensing products. Likewise, the estimated carbon stock is in close agreement with reference biomass datasets, particularly over regions with more than 50 % forest cover."

This involves using computed land-use transition rates, supplemented by translation rules, to simulate key land-cover properties such as forest cover and vegetation carbon.",

Large uncertainties exist due to factors like varying conversion rates of primary and secondary vegetation, historical land-use activities, and discrepancies in carbon emission estimates.",

Additionally, the global carbon budget reports significant variability in cumulative LULCC carbon emissions, with anomalies such as the 'pasture anomaly' where implausible high conversion rates led to anomalous emissions, particularly during the 1950s.",

This simulation approach incorporates historical land-use change data to model forest cover and vegetation carbon, comparing results with multiple published datasets for validation.",
