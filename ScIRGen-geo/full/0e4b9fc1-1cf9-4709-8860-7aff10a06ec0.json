                "Subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction of droughts and floods is one of the major challenges of weather and climate prediction. Recent studies suggest that the springtime land surface temperature/subsurface temperature (LST/SUBT) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) can be a new source of S2S predictability. The successful prediction of droughts and floods at subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) time scales is one of the major challenges of weather and climate prediction, with failures that can result in major adverse impacts on societies and economies. Sea surface temperature (SST) variations such as those associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillations are known to provide a predictability source. Recent studies suggest that springtime land surface/subsurface temperature (LST/SUBT) provides a new source of predictability at S2S time scales. The Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) program has initiated the project “Impact of Initialized Land Surface Temperature and Snowpack on Subseasonal to Seasonal Prediction (LS4P)” to investigate the impact of springtime LST/SUBT anomalies over high mountain areas on summertime precipitation predictions.",
                "The background temperature gradient at midlatitudes also affects the activity of baroclinic eddies (Xue et al., 2023), which can further reinforce the zonal wind changes and further influence the zonal wind downstream as the eddies move downstream and interact with the zonal flow. The response of the zonal wind in the downstream of TP is consistent with these studies, exhibiting a significant deceleration of the zonal wind along the jet core over the North Pacific. Meanwhile, a significant acceleration of the zonal wind is found to the north of the jet core, indicating a slight northward shift of the jet stream. Such changes in the zonal wind have their counterparts in the observations (see Fig. 4b). One salient feature in Fig. 5a is the strong negative geopotential height anomaly over the TP at 200 hPa, accompanied with a cyclonic anomalous circulation. Such a circulation response corresponds to the cold anomaly over the TP, where the atmosphere sinks and induces negative potential height anomalies at upper levels. Furthermore, evident wave-like patterns downstream from the TP to the North Pacific are shown in the geopotential height difference in Fig. 5a. The negative center of geopotential height anomaly over the TP extends eastward to Japan, while a strong positive geopotential height center with anticyclonic circulation flow emerges to the east over the Bering Strait with a center around 170°E, 50°N. The wave-like geopotential height differences further extend from the Rocky Mountain across the North American continent, North Atlantic Ocean, and back to the Eurasian continent. The above simulated response in atmospheric circulations is in general consistent with the observed geopotential height anomalies in May 2003 (Fig. 5b). In addition, responses in the geopotential height to the cold TP surface are also noticed in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in the midlatitudes (Fig. 5a, b). Therefore, we also inspect the anomalous stream function from the simulated wind. The WAF is parallel to the group velocity of Rossby waves and can approximately indicate the wave energy propagation.",
                "Although the teleconnections caused by the heating due to oceanic temperature anomalies, such as those between ENSO and the Asian monsoons, have been extensively investigated (e.g., Wang et al. 2000; Li et al. 2007; Li et al. 2017), the remote effects of mountain heating on global atmospheric circulations have not been fully studied. The LS4P-I experiment provides a chance to explore the detailed features of the TRC wave train as well as the global response of atmospheric circulations to the TP surface anomaly. It is well known and extensively studied that the TP surface thermal state can significantly influence the weather and climate in East Asia (e.g. Liu et al. 2020). Earlier studies have shown that, in summertime, there exists a circumglobal teleconnection pattern (CTP) in the extra-tropics of the Northern Hemisphere along the westerly jet. The latent heat with the strong convective monsoon precipitation is suggested a major driver for the CTP (e.g. Lau and Peng 1991; Lau and Weng 2002; Lau et al. 2004 ; Ding and Wang 2005; Ding et al. 2011)."

The present work explores the simulated global scale response of the atmospheric circulation to the springtime TP land surface cooling by 16 current state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) participating in the LS4P Phase I (LS4P-I) experiment. More dynamical understanding of the TRC wave train as well as its cross-equator propagation into the Southern Hemisphere will be explored in the newly launched LS4P phase II experiment.",

These results taken together suggest that the TRC wave train plays a key role in the influence of TP’s surface and subsurface temperatures on the hot spot regions, especially for the regions in North America, though the detailed mechanisms through which the TRC wave train affects the precipitation in these different regions still need further investigations.",

However, over the regions from the North Atlantic to the Ural Mountains, the observed geopotential height anomalies show opposite signs to the multi-model average, suggesting that in those regions the TP surface cooling may not be the major cause for the observed circulation anomalies. The main difference is that the simulated atmospheric response in model ensemble evolve faster than the observation. The associated diversities in the model response in the Southern Hemispheric circulations could be one of the main reasons that the simulated response exhibit great inconsistency with the observation, though the model ensembles show strong Southern Hemispheric responses especially in the mid-high latitudes.",
                "Compared with the observation, none of the LS4P-I ESMs well captures the observed T2m cold anomaly in May 2003. The ensemble mean of the 16 LS4P-I ESMs exhibits a warm bias of 1.02 °C over the TP, which is stronger than the standard deviation of the observed inter-annual variation of TP T2m (about 0.7 °C). The spatial distribution of the model bias for the ensemble mean is shown in Fig. 1b, which shows a clear warm bias in May 2003 T2m over the eastern part of the TP. The LS4P-I simulations further show that the TP surface thermal state not only has circumglobal influence in the Northern Hemisphere, but it also affects the extratropical atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere, though with a large uncertainty due to inter-model variability."

Two sets of numerical experiments were conducted in LS4P-I to investigate the global influence of the TP spring surface temperature anomaly. A first set of runs, referred to as EXP_CTRL, is designed to evaluate the performance of the 16 ESMs in simulating the TP T2m and precipitation anomalies during May and June 2003. In EXP_CTRL runs, the ESMs start simulations from late April or May 1st, and use the standard S2S prediction setting of atmospheric and land initial conditions. Another set of numerical experiments was carried out by the ESMs to test whether the regional bias in June precipitation mentioned in the previous paragraph is related to the bias in May surface temperature over TP. In this set of experiments, which are collectively referred to as EXP_LST/SUBT run, the models’ bias in May TP T2m is reduced by initializing the TP LST and SUBT conditions."

The TRC wave train modulated by the TP thermal anomaly play a critical role on the early summer surface air temperature and precipitation anomalies in the regions along the wave train, especially over the northwest North America and the southern Great Plains. These results suggest that the TP LST/SUBT anomaly via the TRC wave train is the first order source of the S2S variability in the regions mentioned.",

The ensemble model simulations show that, with the strong westerly jet across the extratropical Asian-Pacific region, the TP surface cooling generates a barotropic, persistent (evolving in time scales longer than a month) TRC wave train from TP through northeast Asia and Bering Strait to the west part of the North America, whose features closely resemble the observed geopotential height anomaly from May to June in 2003.",
                "The key features of the simulated ensemble mean of June precipitation in response to the TP LST/SUBT effect were discussed in Xue et al. (2022). The LS4P-I experiment, however, shows that the TP surface anomaly can result in persistent and global scale anomalies in atmospheric circulations, and has a near-global influence on the summer T2m and precipitation on S2S time scale. Furthermore, the LS4P-I experiment confirms and highlights the important even critical role of the TRC wave train in the global influence of the TP surface anomaly. The analysis of 16 state-of-the-art ESMs shows for the first time that the springtime TP surface anomaly can modulate a persistent quasi-barotropic TRC wave train."

                "Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) precipitation prediction in boreal spring and summer months, despite including large number of high-impact events, such as droughts/floods, has remained poor for years. Tibetan Plateau (TP) spring observed surface temperatures show a lag correlation with summer precipitation in several remote regions, but current global land–atmosphere coupled models are unable to represent this behavior due to significant errors in producing observed TP surface temperatures. The land’s role in the climate system at various scales has been the subject of much research since the 1970s. A few land surface attributes, such as albedo, soil moisture, leaf area index, vegetation, and aerosols in snow have been extensively investigated to explore their roles in land–atmosphere interactions. Ocean state is well known to play a major role in modulating Earth’s climate. The linkage of hydrological events to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, such as El Niño and La Niña, has been used to predict climate events with useful skill at long lead times ranging from a few months to a few years. However, studies have also consistently shown that the SST only partially explains climate predictability. Recent preliminary studies based on observational data and modeling have indicated that spring land temperature in the Rocky Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau (TP) could affect summer drought/flood in their respective downstream regions with a magnitude comparable to the SST effect and atmospheric internal variability. Although land surface 2-m air temperature (T2m) measurements have the best quality and longest record among various land surface variables with global coverage, their application in land–atmosphere interaction studies, S2S prediction in particular, has largely been overlooked."

This study reveals for the first time that high-mountain land temperature could be a substantial source of S2S precipitation predictability, and its effect is probably as large as ocean surface temperature over global “hotspot” regions identified here.

Most studies of land–atmosphere interactions have been limited by a lack of observational data and tend to focus on local feedbacks. Current state-of-the-art ESMs are unable to fully preserve the memory from initialized LST anomalies due to deficiencies in model parameterizations and in the reanalysis data that provide unbalanced initial atmospheric/land conditions. There are two issues that need further investigation: 1) The ensemble-mean-produced T2m difference is smaller than the observed anomaly. Would this deficiency cause an underestimation of the TP T2m effect? 2) In some areas, the ensemble mean produces a significant June precipitation difference, such as in western Australia and western Europe, but with the opposite sign compared to the observation. Is this due to a model deficiency in its ability to produce the full TP T2m anomaly and/or correct precipitation anomaly, and/or some other processes involved?"

Two pairs of experiments with 16 state-of-the-art LS4P ESMs (Table ES1) have been conducted. In the first experiment (referred to as control run), we evaluate whether the ESMs can properly produce the observed TP T2m anomaly in May 2003 and the June precipitation anomaly. To alleviate the ESMs’ May TP T2m bias and to generate the observed cold TP spring anomaly, we introduce an innovative approach to initializing the LST/SUBT over the TP. After adjusting the LST/SUBT initial conditions based on each model’s T2m bias and observed anomaly over the TP, a second experiment (referred to as the sensitivity run) is conducted using the new LST/SUBT initial condition for each model over the TP, with all other initial and boundary conditions and ensemble members identical to the first experiment."
