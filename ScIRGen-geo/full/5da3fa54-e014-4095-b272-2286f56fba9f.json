            "description": "The data are collected from the automatic weather station (AWS, Campbell company) in the moraine area of the 24K glacier in the Southeast Tibet Plateau, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The geographic coordinates are 29.765 ° n, 95.712 ° E and 3950 m above sea level. The data include daily arithmetic mean data of air temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), wind speed (M / s), net radiation (w / m2), water vapor pressure (kPa) and air pressure (mbar). In the original data, an average value was recorded every 30 minutes before October 2018, and then an average value was recorded every 10 minutes. The temperature and humidity are measured by hmp155a temperature and humidity probe. The net radiation probe is nr01, the atmospheric pressure sensor probe is ptb210, and the wind speed sensor is 05103. These probes are 2 m above the ground. Data quality: the data has undergone strict quality control. The original abnormal data of 10 minutes and 30 minutes are removed first, and then the arithmetic mean of each hour is calculated. Finally, the daily value is calculated. If the number of hourly data is less than 24, the data is removed, and the corresponding date data in the data table is empty. In addition to the lack of some parameter data due to the thick snow and low temperature in winter and spring, the data can be used by scientific researchers who study climate, glacier and hydrology through strict quality control.",

                    "Answer": "An 'automatic weather station (AWS)' refers to a system used for collecting meteorological data automatically. In this context, it is used to gather data such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, net radiation, vapor pressure, and atmospheric pressure at specific intervals. The station operates without human intervention, providing consistent and reliable data collection over time. The AWS mentioned in the field uses specific sensors positioned 2 meters above the ground to collect these meteorological parameters at a glacier site in Tibet.",

                    "Question": "What can be inferred about the precision and reliability of meteorological data collection methods when observing consistent daily averages derived from varying recording intervals, such as every 30 minutes and then every 10 minutes?",
                    "Answer": "The meteorological data collection methods described involve recording averages at different intervals, initially every 30 minutes and later every 10 minutes. The transition to more frequent recordings suggests an effort to enhance precision and capture more detailed temporal variations. The reliability of these methods is reinforced by the use of strict quality control processes that remove anomalous data and require complete hourly datasets to calculate daily averages. This indicates a methodological rigor aimed at ensuring data accuracy and reliability, which is crucial for research in climate, glacier, and hydrological studies.",

                    "Answer": "The ultimate goal of collecting basic meteorological data from an automatic weather station in a glacial region is to provide valuable insights into climate, glacier, and hydrological studies. By monitoring parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, radiation, vapor pressure, and atmospheric pressure, researchers can better understand the environmental conditions affecting glacial areas. This data aids in assessing climate change impacts, studying glacier dynamics, and improving water resource management. The rigorous quality control applied to the data ensures its reliability for scientific research.",

                    "Answer": "To set up an automatic weather station for collecting basic meteorological data in glacial environments, instruments such as the HMP155A temperature and humidity probe, NR01 net radiation probe, PTB210 atmospheric pressure sensor, and 05103 wind speed sensor are installed at a height of 2 meters above the surface. Data quality is ensured through rigorous quality control procedures, which include excluding anomalous data from the original 10-minute and 30-minute records, calculating hourly arithmetic means, and deriving daily values. If hourly data are insufficient, corresponding daily data are marked as null. Overall, strict quality control processes are implemented to ensure the reliability of the data for research purposes.",
