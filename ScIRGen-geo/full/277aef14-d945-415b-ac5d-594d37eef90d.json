            "description": "By archaeological investigation and excavation in Tibetan Plateau and Hexi corridor, we discovered more than 40 Neolithic and Bronze Age sites, including Zongri, Sanjiaocheng, Huoshiliang, Ganggangwa, Yigediwonan, Shaguoliang, Guandi, Maolinshan, Dongjicuona, Nuomuhong, Qugong, Liding and so on. In this dataset, there are some basic informations about these sites, such as location, longitude, latitude, altitude, material culture and so on. On this Basis, we identified animal remains, plant fossil, selected some samples for radiocarbon dating,  optically stimulated luminescence dating, stable carbon, nitrogen isotopes, polle, fungal sporen and environmental proxies. This dataset provide important basic data for understanding when and how prehistoric human lived in the Tibetan Plateau during the Neolithic and Bronze Age.",

Additionally, scientific collection, identification, and laboratory analysis of plant and animal remains provided radiocarbon dating, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and identification data of animal and plant remains. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data, pollen data, fungal spore data, and environmental indicators were also analyzed. These patterns help infer the activities and subsistence strategies of ancient people in the region.",

This involves systematic collection, identification, and laboratory analysis of the remains. The process includes obtaining carbon-14 dating data, optically stimulated luminescence dating data, identification data of animal and plant remains, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data, pollen data, fungal spore data, and environmental indicator data.
