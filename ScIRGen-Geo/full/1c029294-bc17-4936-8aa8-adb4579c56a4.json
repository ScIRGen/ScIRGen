        "Glaciers have long been classified as “temperate” and “polar” glacier (Ahlmann, 1935) or “temperate”, “sub-continental” and “polar continental” glacier in terms of geophysical properties (Shi, 2005), a temperate glacier being one that is at the melting point throughout except for a thin surface layer subject to seasonal cooling. A temperate glacier reacts very sensitive to air temperature than a sub- and polar continental glacier. The thermodynamic state of a glacier ice is subject to both seasonal and long-term climatic changes (Zagorodnov et al., 2006) and strongly determines their behavior (Blatter, 1987). Generally, a glacier’s active-layer temperature (ALT) depends on air temperature, accumulation, firn density, solar radiation, clouds (long wave radiation), surface albedo, wind (speed and direction), melt water runoff, percolation and refreezing of melt water, ice flow, the surface net energy balance and other parameters (Salamatin, 2000; Paterson, 1994; Harrison, 1972). The glacier’s ALT studies at home and abroad began in 1930s (Nye, 1953), while the deep borehole temperature in the late 1950s (Budd et al., 1976). Since the 1970s, most research of borehole temperatures focused on the continental and polar glaciers, especially in Antarctica, Greenland, Alps, Rockies, Svalbard and Himalayas, etc. (Sobota, 2011; Han et al., 1995; Haeberli and Funk, 1991; Blatter and Kappenberger, 1988). Most researchers emphasize four different contents: (a) firn temperatures measured in shallow holes (Alean et al., 1983); (b) heat exchange and thermal conductivity in the active layer (Xie et al., 1998; Funk et al., 1994); (c) temperature gradients and heat fluxes at the glacier base (Wegmann et al., 1998; Oeschger et al., 1977); and (d) the relationship between air temperature and the active-layer temperature (Zagorodnov et al., 2006). There are also detailed studies of spatial distribution of borehole temperature, especially in ice cap and the tongue of glacier (Robin and De, 1995; Haeberli and Alean, 1985). However, as of now, relatively few studies concentrated on the thermal regime of temperate glaciers except for several glaciers in the earlier period (Li et al., 2007; Mikhalenko, 1997; Huang et al., 1982)."

      "research objective": [
        "In order to better understand ALT characteristics of a temperate glacier and its response to climate change, this paper used recent three borehole temperatures to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of ALTs and their relationships with air temperature and mass balance on the ablation zone of Baishui Glacier No. 1 (BSG1), southeastern Tibetan Plateau, and revealed their inter-decadal variation towards climate change by making use of ALT measured data and comparing with previous studies."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "Due to many ice crevasses everywhere in summer and autumn and large solid precipitation in winter and spring, the temperature profiles are often either buried for several months or some thermistors are damaged, which brought greater difficulties and challenges for continuous boreholes temperature monitoring. However, automatic weather station (4 750 m a.s.l.) is completely buried by snowfall with about 2 500 mm, and all meteorological data cannot be gained during this period. At the same time, ice crevasse distributes all over glacier surface in the ablation period, while the borehole was buried by snow for several months in the accumulation period. Some heat-sensitive temperature probes are damaged seriously and data observation is delayed by these factors, resulting in the loss of some probes and data."
      ],
      "methods": [
        "In this paper, the data and information (ALT, meteorology, and mass balance) mainly come from historical document “Glaciers in Hengduan Mountain” recorded on July 11, 1982 (Pu, 1994) and the measured data from September, 2008 to August, 2010. In the study, the A, B and C borehole temperatures are monitored by temperature measurement system, which includes thermistors (heat-sensitive probes), wires and ammeter. All borehole thermistors are soldered to individual two-conductor cables and waterproofed by heat-shrink tubing. All thermistors were installed in the boreholes with a vertical spacing varying each 1 m using a heat-sensitive attached to a cable. The resistance was directly measured by Digital Multimeter True RMS189 Fluke Company produced in the United States. Finally, the measured resistance is converted to temperature by Steinhart-Hart equation. In September, 2009, an automatic weather station nearby the borehole C with an altitude of 4 750 m a.s.l. was installed."

      "findings": [
        "The results showed that the influence of air temperature on the active-layer ice temperature had a hysteresis characteristic on the upper of ablation zone and the lag period increased gradually with the altitude elevating. The decrease amplitude of ALT in the accumulation period was far below its increase magnitude in the ablation period. At the same time, the mean glacier ice temperatures at 10 m depth (T10) in A, B and C profile were obviously higher than most of glaciers previously studied. Measured data also showed that the mean ALT increased by 0.24 °C in 0.5–8.5 m depth of the C profile during 28 years from July 11, 1982 to July 10, 2009."

        "AnswerCn": "连续钻孔温度监测面临的挑战包括温度剖面被雪和冰裂缝埋藏，这可能会损坏温度传感器并导致数据丢失。自动气象站也可能被积雪埋没，从而阻止数据收集。为了减轻这些问题，必须对温度传感器进行坚固的防水处理，战略性地放置以避免冰裂缝，并进行频繁的维护检查。此外，在高雪期部署冗余系统或替代数据收集方法可以确保数据的连续性。",

        "QuestionCn": "请识别可以与气象观测数据集成的潜在数据集，以增强对温带冰川动态及其对气候变化响应的理解。",
        "AnswerEn": "Potential datasets that could be integrated include historical glacier mass balance records, spatial distribution data of borehole temperatures, and firn density measurements. These datasets, when combined with meteorological observations, can provide a comprehensive understanding of glacier dynamics, including the relationship between air temperature and active-layer temperature, and the glacier's thermodynamic responses to climatic variations.",
        "AnswerCn": "潜在的可集成数据集包括历史冰川质量平衡记录、钻孔温度的空间分布数据和雪层密度测量数据。这些数据集与气象观测结合，可以提供对冰川动态的全面理解，包括空气温度与活层温度之间的关系，以及冰川对气候变化的热力学响应。",
