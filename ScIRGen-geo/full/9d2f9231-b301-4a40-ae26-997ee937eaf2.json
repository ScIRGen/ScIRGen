Iincluding the survey photos of 28 sample points in Qilian County in 2020. The photos of each sample point are placed in a separate In a folder, the folder is named the sample number. The photos of each sample point include photos of the landscape around the sample point, photos of the plant community in the sample square and close-up photos of the dominant species. The vegetation in the sample can be observed The status of the community, the status of the soil surface and the slope of the surrounding sampling area, human interference, etc. The photos are all original images, in jpg format, taken with a mobile phone or camera, and the specific latitude and longitude information of the sampling points are in a separate Excel table in the compressed package In, you can compare and view.",
