Net primary productivity (NPP) determines the rate of atmospheric carbon absorbed by vegetation and is a measure of plant growth. It is a major component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Accurate estimation of NPP at regional and global scales is of great importance for understanding the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming and to land use change induced by human activities. The Heihe River basin is the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of north-west China. Geographic differentiation in the basin is evident. From south to north of the basin, there are three major geomorphological units: the southern Qilian Mountains in the upper stream, the Hexi Corridor in the midstream and the northern Alxa High Plain in the downstream."
