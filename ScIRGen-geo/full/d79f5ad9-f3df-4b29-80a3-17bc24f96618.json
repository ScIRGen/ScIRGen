            "description": "The basic cationic and anionic constituents, as well as trace elements (including rare earth elements), of geothermal spring waters rich in Li, Rb, and Cs from Gudui geothermal field in Tibet, collected in 2022 and 2023, were determined utilizing conventional chemical analysis, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (iCAP), ion chromatography (ICS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrumentation. These sites include the Gudui Geothermal Field, Zhumaisha, Pamu, and Amoluomo. All analytical measurements were carried out in accredited laboratories, ensuring the precision and reliability of the data. The dataset shows that the average concentrations of Li, Rb, and Cs in Gudui geothermal springs are 15.756 mg/L, 1.228 mg/L, and 7.413 mg/L respectively, showing obvious abnormal enrichment of rare elements. This dataset will be employed for calculating the flux of lithium, rubidium, and cesium in geothermal springs and for investigating the distribution, sources, enrichment mechanisms, and mineralization patterns of rare element-rich geothermal springs.",
