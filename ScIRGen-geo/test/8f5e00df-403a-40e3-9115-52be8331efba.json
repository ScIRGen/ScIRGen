            "description": "The data set contains the plant liquid flow meter data (101.1346 ° e, 41.9900 ° n) of the mixed forest station in the surface process comprehensive observation network of Heihe River Basin from October 20, 2019 to December 7, 2020. The study area is located in the Populus euphratica forest in Ejina Banner, Alashan League, inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, at an altitude of 874m. According to different heights and DBH of Populus euphratica forest, sample trees are selected to install the developed plant liquid flow instrument. Each sample tree is installed with two groups, with a height of 1.3m.\nThe original observation data of the plant liquidometer is the temperature difference between the probes, and the time is 10 minutes. The published data is the temperature difference data delta every 10 minutes_ T (℃), liquid flow rate V (cm / h) and daily transpiration t (mm / D). Firstly, the liquid flow rate and liquid flow volume are calculated according to the temperature difference between the probes, and then the transpiration t is calculated according to the Populus euphratica forest area and tree spacing at the observation point. At the same time, the post-processing of the calculated rate and flux values: (1) eliminate the data obviously beyond the physical meaning or beyond the instrument range; (2) Missing data are marked with - 6999; (3) Suspicious data caused by probe failure and other reasons shall be identified in red font, and the data confirmed to be problematic shall be eliminated.\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for site information and Qiao et al. (2015) for observation data processing.",

                    "Answer": "植物液流仪, or plant sap flow meter, is a device used to measure the flow of sap in plants which is crucial for understanding the plant's water use and transpiration rates. In the context of monitoring key hydrological parameters in ecosystems, it involves recording the temperature difference between probes inserted into the plant, with data collected every 10 minutes. This data is then used to calculate sap flow rates and transpiration amounts, which provide insights into the plant's water usage and the overall hydrological cycle within the ecosystem.",

(2) Marking missing data with a placeholder value (-6999) to maintain data integrity.

These steps help ensure that the calculated rates and transpiration values are accurate and reliable, but they also highlight the challenges in maintaining data quality in environmental monitoring.",

The data collected helps in calculating sap flow rate and transpiration amount, which are crucial for assessing the ecological processes and water cycles in the region.

The raw observational data consists of temperature differences between probes, recorded every 10 minutes. The steps to process this data include calculating sap flow rate and flux from the temperature differences, and then computing daily transpiration based on forest area and tree spacing. Post-processing involves removing data that exceeds physical or instrumental limits, marking missing data with -6999, and identifying suspicious data due to probe failures for further investigation.",
