            "titleEn": "HiWATER: The multi-scale observation experiment on evapotranspiration over heterogeneous land surfaces  (MUSOEXE-12)-dataset of flux observation matrix (thermal dissipation sap flow velocity Probe) from Jun to Sep, 2012",
            "description": "This dataset includes observational data of sap flow from 14 June to 21 September, 2012. The study area was located in the irrigation area within the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, China. Sample trees were selected for installing TDP (thermal dissipation sap flow velocity probe) instruments according to their height and diameter at breast height (DBH); only Popolusgansuensis trees were selected in this study. The TDP instrument is made in China; the model type was TDP30. There were 3 TDP observation sites, i.e., TDP-1, TDP-2 and TDP-3, which were located near the LAS4_S, EC6 and EC8 sites, respectively. The order of tree heights was TDP-2 > TDP-1 > TDP-3, and the order of DBH was TDP-2 > TDP-3 > TDP-1. At each site, 3 representative trees were selected to measure the sap flow. Three TDPs were mounted on the stem of each tree, one each for the southeast, southwest and north directions; the mounting height is 1.3 meters.\nEach TDP had two probes. The raw TDP data included the temperature difference between the two probes at a frequency of 30 s. The released data include the 10 minute-averaged sap flow rate (cm/h), sap flow flux (cm^3/h), and daily transpiration (mm/d). The sap flow rate and the sap flow flux were calculated according to the temperature difference between the two probes; the shelter-forest transpiration per unit area (Q) was calculated based on the area of shelterbelts and density of Popolusgansuensis trees at each site. The data preprocessing steps included the following. (1) Unphysical data were excluded. (2) Missing data were filled with -6999. (3) Suspicious data, which were most likely caused by probe failure, were marked in red; confirmed bad data were excluded.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2016) (for multi-scale observation experiment or sites information), Qiao et al. (2015) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "The Thermal Dissipation sap flow velocity Probe (TDP) is an instrument used to measure sap flow in trees. It operates by detecting the temperature difference between two probes installed in the tree trunk, which are affected by the heat dissipation caused by sap flow. In the context of the dataset, TDPs were used to measure sap flow at different points within a forest area, with probes installed at 1.3 meters height on sample trees, oriented towards the southeast, southwest, and north directions. The raw data collected was the temperature difference between the probes, recorded every 30 seconds and averaged over 10-minute intervals. This data was then processed to calculate sap flow rate, sap flow volume, and daily transpiration, providing insights into the water usage and transpiration characteristics of the trees in the study area.",

This method requires post-processing to exclude physically implausible values and identify suspect data due to probe failures.

Data processing includes calculating sap flow rate and flux from temperature differences, using forest protection strip area and tree spacing to determine transpiration per unit area, and performing post-processing steps such as removing physically implausible or instrument-range-exceeding data, marking missing data with -6999, and identifying and excluding suspicious readings due to probe faults.",
