            "description": "The dataset includes charcoal identification and dating results of fruit trees dating from about 5200-2600 BP at 16 archaeological sites in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.We combine this with reported multidisciplinary evidence to explore the history of fruit-tree utilization as well as its relation to the subsistence strategy in the NETP during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Our results demonstrate that Rosaceae [Prunus L., Prunus Padus L., Maloideae L., and Malus baccata (L.) Borkh], Elaeagnaceae (Hippophae L. and Elaeagnus angustifolia L.), and Rhamnaceae (only Ziziphus Mill.) were used by people in the NETP, and there was a downward trend in the use of fruit trees during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. This is in notable contrast to the situation in the Chinese Loess Plateau in the parallel period. The cold-dry climate during the Bronze Age seemed to be one of the reasons. The fruit trees used by people in the NETP were likely gathered from the wild rather than consciously cultivated, and the subsistence strategy of agropastoralism may have played a significant role during the processes.",

                    "Answer": "The identification results of charcoal and dating data suggest that during the late Neolithic to Bronze Age, there was a decline in the utilization of fruit trees, such as those from the Rosaceae family, including plum, peach, apple, and black apple genera. This trend indicates a significant contrast with the contemporaneous trends in the Chinese Loess Plateau, likely influenced by the cold and dry climate of the Bronze Age. It implies that the fruit trees used were likely collected from the wild rather than cultivated, and that agropastoral survival strategies played a significant role in this historical context.",

The data indicates a decline in fruit tree use, which contrasts with trends in the Chinese Loess Plateau. This shift could be attributed to the colder and drier climate during the Bronze Age, suggesting that fruit trees were likely gathered from the wild rather than cultivated, reflecting an adaptation in survival strategies involving agro-pastoral practices.",

By combining charcoal identification results with multidisciplinary evidence, the study aims to understand how fruit tree usage trends changed over time and to investigate the ecological environments of Rosaceae species, such as plum, peach, apple, and black apple. This exploration also seeks to understand the reasons behind the declining trend in fruit tree utilization in this region compared to the simultaneous trends on the Chinese Loess Plateau, potentially due to cold and dry climate conditions during the Bronze Age.",
