            "description": "The dataset mainly includes zircon Hf isotope data of Mesozoic and Cenozoic granitoids and some dykes in the central and western Lhasa massif, southern Tibet. This data is mainly used to study the origin of various magmatic rocks related to Neotethys subduction at the convergent plate margin, and to constrain the subduction process; The study of the genesis of various magmatic rocks during the syn collision between India and Eurasia is of great significance to the study of the net growth of continental crust and the genesis of silicon rich continental crust; The study of the genesis of various post collisional magmatic rocks is of great significance to the discussion of the mechanism of post collisional tectonomagmatism and the crust mantle structure; It is of great significance to study the petrogenesis of volcanic rocks in the collision zone and the origin of temporal and spatial variations of enriched components in magma for using petrological evidence to constrain the time limit of Indo Eurasian collision. In addition, the data set also includes zircon Hf isotope data of late Triassic granitoids from Yidun terrane in the eastern Qinghai Tibet Plateau, which can be used to study the origin of large batholiths at the margin of convergent plates and determine the genetic mechanism of silicon rich continental crust. 60 sets of test samples, excluding repeated sample testing, are tested by MC-ICP-MS, and the testing unit is China University of Geosciences (Beijing). The data comes from published articles, which are true and reliable. It can be applied to the study of magmatic rock genesis.",

Procedurally, the dataset includes 60 sets of test samples, excluding repeated sample tests, which ensures that the data is reliable and valid for research purposes.
