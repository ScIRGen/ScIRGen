            "description": "This data set contains information on natural disasters in Tibet of nearly 50 years, including the time, place and the consequences of natural disasters such as drought, snows disasters, frost hazards, hail, floods, gales, and lightning disasters. \nTibet is located on the southwest border of China and is the main body of the Tibetan Plateau. Due to the influence of the westerly winds, weather and strong warm and wet air currents from the Indian Ocean, the dry and wet seasons are obvious. In addition, the mountains and forests are numerous, and the terrain is complex in Tibet, which makes Tibet among those regions in China having the highest frequencies of natural disasters. The main meteorological disasters that cause significant damage to the production of agriculture and animal husbandry in Tibet are snows disasters, frost hazards, hail, floods and gales. According to incomplete statistics, the average annual disaster area from 1982 to 2000 was 28,440 hectares, of which the disaster area in 1983 was the largest, 203,700 hectares, followed by 1995 with a disaster area of 133,300 hectares. From the proportions of various disaster areas in the total area affected by the disasters, the proportion under drought is the largest, reaching 38%, followed by that under diseases and insect pests, which was 25%. Tibet is sparsely populated, and the ecological environment is very fragile. Traditional farming and animal husbandry production basically relies on people. Various meteorological disasters have caused heavy losses to the lives and property of the Tibetan people. Snow disasters topped the list of various meteorological disasters in Tibet. Tibet is one of the five largest pastoral areas in the country, and livestock is the most important source of production and livelihood for herdsmen. Snow disasters often cause large numbers of livestock death, significant property losses to herdsmen and threat to their lives. \nThe data are extracted from the Tibet Volume of Chinese Meteorological Disaster Dictionary, with manual entry, summarizing and proofreading.",
            "descriptionCn": "本数据集包含西藏近50年的自然灾害信息，包括干旱、雪灾、霜灾、冰雹、洪涝、风灾、雷电灾害等气象灾害产生的时间地点及所造成的后果。\n 西藏位于中国的西南边境，是青藏高原的主体。由于受到西风带天气影响和印度洋暖湿气流的强烈影响，干湿季明显，加之境内高山林立，地形地貌复杂，西藏成为我国自然灾害发生最频繁的地区之一。对西藏农牧业生产造成重大危害的主要气象灾害方式有：干旱、雪灾、霜冻、冰雹、洪涝和大风等。据不完全统计，1982-2000年平均每年受灾面积为2.844万公顷，其中1983年受灾面积最大，达20．37万公顷，其次是1995年，为13.23万公顷。从各种灾害面积占总受灾面积比例来看，干旱所占比例最大，达38％，病虫害次之，为25％。西藏地广人稀，生态环境十分脆弱，传统的农牧业生产基本靠人吃饭。各种气象灾害给西藏人民生命财产带来重大损失。在西藏的各种气象灾害中雪灾居首。西藏是全国五大牧区之一，牲畜是牧民最重要的生产生活来源。雪灾往往造成大批牲畜死亡，使牧民的财产遭受重大损失，并对其生命安全构成威胁。\n数据摘录自《中国气象灾害大典·西藏卷》，属于人工录入总结校对。",

Additionally, the region is characterized by a rugged mountainous terrain with complex topography, making data collection difficult. The area's sparse population and fragile ecological environment further complicate the collection process. These factors, combined with the reliance on traditional agriculture and pastoralism, mean that meteorological disasters, particularly snow disasters, pose significant threats to the livelihood and safety of the Tibetan people.",

The comprehensiveness of the dataset might also be affected by the subjective interpretation of data collectors. In a region like Tibet, with its complex geography and frequent natural disasters, the accuracy of location-specific data is crucial, but manual processes might struggle to capture detailed spatial nuances. Furthermore, changes in data collection methods and standards over time could result in inconsistencies in the dataset, potentially impacting the reliability of long-term trend analyses.",
                "AnswerCn": "依赖手动输入和总结的数据在如此长的时间段内可能会引入各种挑战和潜在的不准确性，因为在数据录入和总结过程中可能会出现人为错误。数据集的全面性也可能受到数据收集者主观解释的影响。在像西藏这样地理复杂且自然灾害频发的地区，位置特定数据的准确性至关重要，但手动过程可能难以捕捉详细的空间细微差别。此外，随着时间的推移，数据收集方法和标准的变化可能导致数据集的不一致性，从而可能影响长期趋势分析的可靠性。",
