            "description": "This set of data is a dataset of annual changes in glacier mass balance in the Himalayan region from 2010 to 2020, stored in ESRI vector polygon format. It is calculated from the DEM elevation difference between 2010 and 2020, RGI the Himalayas glacier coverage thematic vector data and ice density of 850 ± 60 kg m − 3. The data items included in the attribute table include: RGIId and GLIMSID representing glacier number, Area representing glacier area, Name representing glacier name, meanElevCh representing average ice surface elevation change (m yr-1) for each glacier, meanElev_ 1 represents error (m yr-1), volChj represents volume change of each glacier (m3 yr-1), volChjSig represents error (m3 yr-1), geoMassBal represents glacier mass balance of each glacier (w.e.yr-1), geoMassB_ 1 represents error (w.e.yr-1), Massch_ M3 represents the change in melting amount of each glacier (m3 w.e.yr-1), Geo_ Melt_ 1 represents the variation error of melting amount for each glacier (m3 w.e.yr-1). The DEM elevation difference between the 2010 and 2020 time periods was calculated by Hugonnet et al. based on the ASTER data generated from these two time periods, using a multi period DEM with a spatial resolution of 100m. Using WGS84 ellipsoid. The maximum error of ice elevation change data is 0.47 m yr-1, and the maximum error of glacier mass balance change data is 0.28 w.e.yr-1. This data can be used for studying glacier changes in the Himalayan region, as well as for studying the hydrological and water resource effects of glacier melting in high-altitude Asia and its climatic reasons.",

                "It is well known that glaciers in mountains are retreating widely in a warmer climate during recent decades on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The runoffs from both glaciers and glacier lakes have been increased significantly, and the potential outbursts of glacier lakes have threatened the residence safety in China and the adjacent countries. However, most of the glaciers locate in very distant mountains. As glaciers are difficult to be investigated due to the huge investments and long traveling time of field surveys, remote sensing monitoring has been the major approach adopted to understand the changes of glaciers nowadays. Mountain glaciers, especially those in temperate regions, are considered one of the best natural indicators of climate change. In recent years, the contribution of glaciers to the rise in lake and sea levels has also received increasing attention, with global glacier melting contributing 29±13% to sea level rise, and global glaciers and ice caps contributing 61±19% to sea level rise. The Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent mountain regions have developed glaciers covering an area of about 50,000 km², which is the largest glacier area in the mid-low latitude region outside the polar regions, and is the source of many famous rivers in Asia, as well as a precious water resource in the arid inland areas. Glacier activity is an important factor inducing glacier debris flow, ice/snow avalanches, and glacier lake outburst floods, with glacier floods often being one of the most impactful glacier disasters. For example, glacier melting leads to the formation and expansion of moraine lakes, and glacier flood disasters caused by moraine or ice-dammed lakes frequently occur, posing catastrophic threats to the safety of life and property in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan regions, affecting countries like China, India, and Nepal. Therefore, with the deepening of global change research, studies on glacier changes (including area, thickness, and ice reserves) are becoming increasingly important, with significant implications for global water resources and climate change, as well as disaster warning."

In the past few decades, remote sensing technology has overcome the limitations of past field survey scope and measured data, greatly shortening the survey cycle, saving survey costs, and improving survey efficiency. However, due to the lack of ground glacier survey data for verification, and the \"change noise\" existing between multi-source data classification results, there are still many challenges in the automatic mapping of glaciers and their changes.
