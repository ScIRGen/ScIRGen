These scenarios are based on the CMIP5 framework and include different concentration pathways like rcp2.6, rcp4.5, and rcp8.5, each representing varying levels of greenhouse gas emissions and their potential impacts on land cover.",

This process includes selecting appropriate RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 8.5), analyzing climate model outputs, and applying these to land cover models to simulate future scenarios.
