And the dataset used in the calculation includes soil clay content (%), silt content (%), and sand content (%), soil organic carbon content (g / kg) and soil texture class. By usint the soil erodibility factor algorithm proposed by Wischmeier (1978) in the second edition of USLE manual and the soil erodibility factor calculation tool (k_tool) developed in this project, a soil erodibility factor map was generated with a resolution of  30 arc second (about 1000m) . The soil erodibility factor data of Pan third pole 65 countries is the essential data for calculating soil erosion rate based on CSLE, it is also the basic data for analyzing soil characteristics.",

                "Rock fragments (>2 mm diameter) are an important component of soil, and its presence has a significant impact on soil erosion and sediment yield. So it is essential to take into full account content of the rock fragments for accurate calculation of soil erodibility factor (K). Soil erodibility factor (K) is a basic parameter in models like USLE, RUSLE, EPIC, and AGNPS, and its value is essential data for regional soil erosion surveys and mapping using models like USLE/CSLE. Since Wischmeier formally proposed the soil erodibility factor (K), numerous studies have been conducted both domestically and internationally, resulting in several methods for estimating soil erodibility factors. Mature algorithms include the USLE-K algorithm, RUSLE2-K algorithm, EPIC-K algorithm, and algorithms based on average geometric particle size. These algorithms calculate the soil erodibility K value based on soil physical and chemical properties (particle size, organic matter, structure, and permeability, etc.). A large body of research indicates that the content of rock fragments in the soil profile and rock fragment cover on the soil surface significantly affect soil hydrology, soil erosion and sediment yield processes, and land use. Brakensiek et al. established a method for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity based on the content of rock fragments in the profile. Poesen et al. demonstrated that rock fragment cover on the soil surface can reduce soil erodibility and can be quantitatively estimated using an exponential decay function. Zhou and Shao found that when the content of rock fragments in the soil exceeds 40%, the soil infiltration rate decreases, and the soil's saturated hydraulic conductivity increases. Jomaa et al.'s laboratory flume experiments showed that rock fragment cover can mitigate raindrop impact, reduce surface water flow, and decrease runoff transport capacity, thereby reducing soil erosion. Hlaváčiková et al. discovered that rock fragments in the profile can reduce saturated hydraulic conductivity, thereby increasing surface runoff and erosion sediment yield."

The joint effect of rock fragments in profile and gravels on the surface reduced the soil erosion rate by 11.8% in the 6 sample areas. In plotting regional soil erosion maps, it is essential to take both of the two into account so as to improve accuracy of the mapping."

The gravels on the surface of the mountain land and desert/gobi reduced K by 18.7% by protecting the soil from splashing of rain drops and scrubbing of runoff; so once the content of rock fragments in the soil profile and gravels on the surface of the land are taken into account in calculation, soil K may be 5.52% lower; (2) In the areas dominated with the effect of rock fragments, about 62.7% of the global land area, soil K decreased by 0.0091(t·hm2·h)·(hm–2·MJ–1·mm–1) on average, while in the area affected mainly by rock fragments in profile, about 31.1% of the global land area, soil K increased by 0.0019(t·hm2·h)·(hm–2·MJ–1·mm–1); and (3) The joint effect of rock fragments in profile and gravels on the surface reduced the soil erosion rate by 11.8% in the 6 sample areas."
