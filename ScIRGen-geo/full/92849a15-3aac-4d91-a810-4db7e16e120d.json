                    "Answer": "The desertification development degree map involves collecting data related to land types such as semi-shifting sandy land and specific formations like Barchan dunes, which require classification of various sand and vegetation characteristics. In contrast, mapping roads or lakes involves more straightforward geographic data capture, focusing on linear and planar features, respectively, using tools like GPS or satellite imagery to define the edges and contours of these features.",

The process involves translating physical map features into digital layers such as desertification levels, rivers, roads, lakes, streets, railways, tree networks, and residential areas, ensuring that the original details and attributes are preserved.",
