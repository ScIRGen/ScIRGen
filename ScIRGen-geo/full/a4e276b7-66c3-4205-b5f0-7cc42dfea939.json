            "description": "GlobalHighPM2.5 is one of the series of long-term, full-coverage, global high-resolution and high-quality datasets of ground-level air pollutants over land (i.e., GlobalHighAirPollutants, GHAP). It is generated from big data (e.g., ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations) using artificial intelligence by considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of air pollution. The coefficient of determination R2 for cross validation with ten fold data is 0.91, and the root mean square error RMSE is 9.2 µ g/m3. The main scope covers the entire global land area, with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of day, month, and year, measured in µg/m3. Attention: This dataset is recorded in Universal Time (UTC, GMT+0) and is continuously updated. If you need more data, please contact the author by email（ weijing_rs@163.com ; weijing@umd.edu ）. The data file contains four types of codes for converting NC to GeoTiff (Python, Matlab, IDL, and R languages) nc2geotiff codes.",

                "Ambient air pollution poses a major global environmental concern, ranked as the fourth highest risk factor for human health, causing ~6.7 million global deaths in 2019 according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 µm) pollution is associated with a variety of circulatory and respiratory diseases, contributing to 4 million deaths globally in 2020. Despite a steady increase in PM2.5 monitoring capabilities over the last decade, many people still live far from monitors. Regional PM2.5 estimates have been extensively studied from the satellite perspective using retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, but only a handful of studies have been conducted on the global PM2.5 scale. Global, daily, high-resolution, and high-quality PM2.5 data are particularly in demand for a wide range of studies, from air quality to climate change and public health, but monitoring it from space is extremely challenging. Observing the heterogeneities requires dense in situ monitoring networks, which only exist in a handful of countries for limited periods. Space-borne remote sensing offers global and uniform coverage, but it is only feasible under clear-sky conditions."

They are very unevenly distributed, dense in developed and populated regions but sparse or missing in under-developed and rural regions, posing great challenges in spatial extrapolation. The ubiquitous presence of clouds (60–70% globally) would lead to very large data gaps, seriously hindering our ability to observe air pollution routinely, exacerbated by inherent difficulties in separating clouds from severe haze and heavy smoke, both of particular concern to the public."

                "Hourly PM2.5 measurements from 2017 and 2022 were collected at approximately ~9500 ground-based monitoring stations around the world. Raw data has undergone further quality control measures, including the removal of outliers, such as negative, repeating (occurring for more than three continuous hours), and extreme (exceeding the 99.9th quantiles) values. Subsequently, days having at least 20% of valid hourly PM2.5 measurements were identified and averaged to obtain daily means at each monitoring site. To ensure consistency with auxiliary variables, all daily PM2.5 measurements were adjusted to the UTC time zone and then used for independent training and validation of ML models. Terra and Aqua MAIAC daily 1 km AOD retrievals at 550 nm with recommended quality assurances from 2017 to 2022 were used. Spatially complete AOD assimilations (550 nm) from the GEOS-FP system every 3 hours at a horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.3125° were employed to fill satellite AOD gaps. First, hourly PM2.5 simulations from the GEOS Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) system at a horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° were employed. Meteorological variables and their vertical profiles were collected from hourly ERA5-Land (~0.1° × 0.1°) and ERA5 global (~0.25° × 0.25°) reanalysis datasets. In total, 19 independent variables were included in this study. Here, the higher-spatial-resolution variables were aggregated, while the low-spatial-resolution variables were resampled to uniform 0.01° × 0.01° grids using the bilinear interpolation approach and used for subsequent air pollution modeling. For satellite AOD gap-filling, Terra and Aqua MAIAC AOD retrievals were first combined via linear regression conversion models to minimize the biases caused by different observation times and to expand the spatial coverage. Available MAIAC AOD retrievals were then used as true values to train the 4D-STET model together with the main GEOS-FP AOD simulations and potentially influencing factors. Missing satellite retrievals can thus be computed to generate daily gapless AODs. For the surface PM2.5 estimation, their ground measurements were regarded as targets, and satellite gap-filled AODs, GEOS-CF PM2.5 simulations, and CAMS pollutant emissions were regarded as main predictors. The trained model was employed to retrieve daily PM2.5 concentrations for each grid using gapless AOD and other auxiliary variables, relying on the reconstructed relationship. Sample-based, station-based, and day-based ten-fold cross-validation (10-CV) methods were used to validate the model."

Strong disparities in exposure risks and duration are exhibited between developed and developing countries, urban and rural areas, and different parts of cities. Wave-like dramatic changes in air quality are clearly seen around the world before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdowns, as is the mortality burden linked to fluctuating air pollution events.

Days with at least 20% of valid hourly PM2.5 measurements are identified and averaged to obtain daily means at each monitoring site. All daily PM2.5 measurements are adjusted to the UTC time zone for consistency with auxiliary variables before being used for training and validation of ML models.",

                    "Answer": "Using satellite AOD retrievals for PM2.5 monitoring on a global scale is challenging due to the need for spatially complete AOD data, which is often hindered by cloud cover and the inherent difficulties in accurately converting AOD to PM2.5 concentrations, requiring sophisticated models to fill satellite AOD gaps and ensure reliable ground-level PM2.5 estimations.",

                    "Answer": "The reliance on ground-based monitoring stations for PM2.5 data collection poses significant challenges due to their uneven distribution, being dense in developed and populated regions but sparse or missing in under-developed and rural areas. This disparity makes it difficult to extrapolate data accurately across regions and hampers the ability to assess air pollution exposure and health effects comprehensively. Additionally, the presence of clouds and the difficulty in separating clouds from haze further complicate data collection from these stations.",

                    "Answer": "The findings of global PM2.5 exposure disparities highlight the need for enhanced air quality monitoring strategies and more equitable public health policies. There are significant disparities in exposure risks between developed and developing countries, urban and rural areas, and within different parts of cities. These disparities suggest that monitoring networks need to be expanded and adapted to address these variations effectively. Public health policies should also be tailored to mitigate the health impacts of air pollution, especially in regions with higher exposure levels.",

The raw data underwent quality control measures, including the removal of outliers, and days with at least 20% valid hourly measurements were averaged to obtain daily means. These measurements were adjusted to UTC and used for training and validating machine learning models. Terra and Aqua MAIAC daily AOD retrievals were used, with spatially complete AOD assimilations from the GEOS-FP system filling gaps. Meteorological variables were collected from ERA5-Land and ERA5 global reanalysis datasets, and variables were resampled to uniform grids for pollution modeling. The 4D-STET model was employed for satellite AOD gap-filling, and the trained model was used to retrieve daily PM2.5 concentrations using gapless AOD and auxiliary variables.",
