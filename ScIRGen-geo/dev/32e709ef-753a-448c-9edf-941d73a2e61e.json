            "description": "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic geological evolution of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, LA-ICP-MS was used to determine the zircon U-Pb age of the rock mass, XRF was used to determine the major oxide and trace element data of the rock mass, and EPMA was used to determine the major element data of the pyroxene in the gabbro, We can obtain the formation age and geological evolution characteristics of the pluton. Combined with previous studies, regional geological characteristics and geochemical data, this study suggests that the Yangtze and Huaxia blocks may have been sutured along the qinhang fault zone, forming the earliest Neoproterozoic back arc system. The early Paleozoic basic rocks are mainly the remelting products of Neoproterozoic subduction mantle.",

                "The Qinzhou Bay‐Hangzhou Bay Suture Zone (QHSZ) lies between the northwestern Yangtze Block and the southeastern Cathaysia Block in South China. Neoproterozoic amalgamation of the two blocks has long been under debate. One of the major advances is that the 970–880 Ma ophiolite suites and arc‐related magmatic rocks were identified in northwestern Zhejiang and northeastern Jiangxi, which are key records of Neoproterozoic subduction in the SCB. The Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks are widely regarded to have experienced a distinct Precambrian evolution history. The basement of the Yangtze Block consists of Archean (e.g., the 2.9–3.2 Ga Kongling Group) and Paleoproterozoic rocks (e.g., the Lengjiaxi Group and its equivalents), which are unconformably overlain by Neoproterozoic‐Paleozoic cover. The Precambrian Cathaysia basement is composed of Paleoproterozoic‐Neoproterozoic schist, gneiss, amphibolite, migmatite, and volcanoclastics along the Wuyi‐Yunkai Domain, covered by Phanerozoic (mainly Mesozoic) igneous and sedimentary rocks. The two blocks amalgamated along a Neoproterozoic (1.0–0.8 Ga) collision belt. Late Neoproterozoic‐Ordovician greenschist‐ to amphibolite‐facies metamorphic rocks in the Cathaysia Block mainly consist of metamorphosed sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The NE‐NNE trending Yunkai Domain is situated in the southern segment of the QHSZ. The Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic mafic rocks are mainly intruded into the Yunkai Group."
