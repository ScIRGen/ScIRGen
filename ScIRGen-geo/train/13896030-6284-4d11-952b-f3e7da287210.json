            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from a Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System of soil moisture of Sidaoqiao Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2022. The site (101.1374° E, 42.0012° N) was located in the Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The elevation is 873 m. The bottom of the probe was 0.5 m above the ground; the sampling interval was 1 hour.\nThe raw COSMOS data include the following: battery (Batt, V), temperature (T, C), relative humidity (RH, %), air pressure (P, hPa), fast neutron counts (N1C, counts per hour), thermal neutron counts (N2C, counts per hour), sample time of fast neutrons (N1ET, s), and sample time of thermal neutrons (N2ET, s). The distributed data include the following variables: Date, Time, P, N1C, N1C_cor (corrected fast neutron counts) and VWC (volume soil moisture, %), which were processed as follows:\n1) Data were removed and replaced by -6999 when (a) the battery voltage was less than 11.8 V, (b) the relative humidity was greater than 80% inside the probe box, (c) the counting data were not of one-hour duration and (d) neutron count differed from the previous value by more than 20%; 2) An air pressure correction was applied to the quality-controlled raw data according to the equation contained in the equipment manual; 3) After the quality control and corrections were applied, soil moisture was calculated using the equation in Zreda et al. (2012), where N0 is the neutron counts above dry soil and the other variables are fitted constants that define the shape of the calibration function. Here, the parameter N0 was calibrated using the in situ observed soil moisture by SoilNET within the footprint; 4) Based on the calibrated N0 and corrected N1C, the hourly soil moisture was computed using the equation from the equipment manual. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Zhu et al. (2015) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

These criteria are specific to this dataset and help ensure the reliability of measurements. Other cosmic ray observation systems may use different or additional criteria depending on the equipment and environmental conditions involved.",

However, it may also reduce the completeness of the dataset by excluding data points that do not meet the screening standards. In the field mentioned, screening criteria include voltage, relative humidity, sampling time interval, and rapid neutron count variations, which could result in a significant amount of data being excluded if the conditions are not met.",

                    "Answer": "Data screening and pressure correction are crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of cosmic ray data collected in environmental observation networks. The screening process involves removing data that could be affected by low battery voltage, high relative humidity, incorrect sampling intervals, or anomalous neutron count changes, which could all lead to data inaccuracies. Pressure correction is necessary as it adjusts the neutron count data to account for variations in atmospheric pressure, which can significantly affect neutron readings. These steps ensure that the data accurately reflects environmental conditions and can be reliably used to estimate soil moisture content.",
