Tibetan Plateau precision modulated by the periodically coupled western and Asian Mongolia. Geophysical research letters, 48, Based on the advantage of accurate dating of the annual laminar sediments of the lake Kusai in the northern Tibetan Plateau, the authors analyzed the changes of plant sporopollen species in the area around the lake Kusai in the past 1656 years (350-2006) with high resolution (~ 5-year resolution), Based on 735 representative soil sporopollen assemblages and meteorological interpolation data within 800 km of Lake Kusai and its surrounding areas, a high-precision sporopollen annual precipitation conversion function was established to quantitatively reconstruct the precipitation and annual mean temperature changes in the past 1656 years. This data set provides a reference for studying the past climate change law and predicting the future climate change trend of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                "As the “Asian Water Tower”, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a crucial role in regulating the hydro-climatology of several prominent Asian rivers, which sustain more than one-fifth of the world’s population in the neighboring countries. In recent decades, the expansion of lake areas as well as the rise of lake levels resulting from increased precipitation and melting of glaciers have been observed in the TP interior. The increased precipitation could substantially improve the ecological environment via increases in vegetation coverage and ecosystem productivity; however, it may also increase the risk of flood disasters threatening the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Observational data indicate that the water vapor in the TP interior is mainly transported by the mid-latitude Westerlies and the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM). Although the available long-term precipitation records derived from tree-rings can extend as far as 3,500 years into the past, they are from the low-elevation marginal regions of the TP, where the water vapor is supplied by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) or the SASM. Precipitation records spanning the past few centuries based on the accumulation rate of ice cores are also available from the high mountains in the TP, but the precipitation processes are quite different from those in the interior of the TP, although the water vapor in both cases is transported by the Westerlies and the Asian summer monsoon. Therefore, long-term precipitation records from the TP interior are important for revealing precipitation cycles on the decadal-centennial scale and their driving mechanisms. Given the wide distribution of lakes in the TP, lacustrine sediments are more suitable than the more geographically limited tree-ring and ice core records for reconstructing past variations in the hydroclimatic conditions of the TP interior. Many studies have used biotic and abiotic indicators from lake sediments as quantitative climatic proxies. Among them, fossil pollen records from lakes have been widely used to reconstruct the paleoclimate of the TP interior."

The relationships between these dominant multidecadal-centennial precipitation cycles and large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns can be used to interpret precipitation variability within the TP over the last 1,656 years. In addition, the results provide a context for interpreting recently increased precipitation across the TP, suggesting the possible persistence of high precipitation in the future."

                "In September 2006, a 364-cm-long sediment core (KSS-V) was raised from the southeastern part of Kusai Lake in a water depth of 14.5 m. The sediment core was cut into blocks for lamination counting. With the assistance of an optical microscope, we counted the lamination at least three times to determine an age model, which has a ∼1% error based on replicate counts. Additionally, we measured the 210Pb, 137Cs activity of the upper 25 cm of the core and 11 AMS 14C ages to validate the robustness of the age model based on annual laminations. 364 samples with an average resolution of 5-years were used for pollen analysis. Lycopodium spores (27,560 grains/tablet) were used before acid-alkali treatment to calculate pollen concentrations. Sample residues were mounted in glycerin and analyzed using a Leica DM 750 microscope with the aid of the Pollen Flora of China. More than 400 terrestrial pollen grains were counted per sample. MAP and MAT were quantitatively reconstructed using C2 software. The modern pollen dataset was derived from previous work. An optimal transfer function was selected by minimizing the root mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP) and maximizing the coefficient of determination (R2) between observed and predicted MAP values. In order to detect the dominant modes of the oscillations in the MAP, we first performed ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), a noise-assisted data analysis, on the reconstructed MAP. We then calculated the power spectrum of the detrended MAP using the Morlet wavelet to characterize its statistical significance. Finally, we estimated the MAP for the next 50 years using singular spectrum analysis (SSA), a widely used nonparametric spectral estimation method in nonlinear climatic time series analysis."

                "The record reveals three dominant cycles, with lengths of ∼200-, ∼88-, and ∼60-years, associated with changes in the Westerlies and the Asian monsoon. These precipitation cycles suggest that the current high precipitation in the TP interior results from the superposition of cyclic highs in precipitation, and this trend may continue for the next several decades. The MAP reconstruction revealed three significant cycles, with periodicities of ∼200-, ∼88-, and ∼60-years, which dominated hydroclimatic variations across the TP interior. The ∼200-years cycle is attributed to the Westerlies, whereas the multidecadal cycles (∼60-years and ∼88-years) are likely related to the Asian monsoon. The record demonstrates that precipitation variations over the TP interior were mainly controlled by the Westerlies, although the Asian monsoon made a substantial contribution in summer. The periodicities in MAP during the last 1,656 years not only support the recent humidification of the TP interior, but they also enable us to predict a possible wetting trend over next decades."
