            "description": "Surface albedo is a critical parameter in land surface energy balance. This dataset provides the monthly land surface albedo of UAV remote sensing for typical ground stations in the middle reaches of Heihe river basin during the vegetation growth stage in 2019. The algorithm for calculating albedo is an empirical method, which was developed based on a comprehensive forward simulation dataset based on 6S model and typical spectrums. This method can effectively transform the surface reflectance to the broadband surface albedo. The method was then applied to the surface reflectance acquired by UAV multi-spectral sensor and the broadband surface albedo with a 0.2-m spatial resolution was eventually obtained.",

This algorithm involves a statistical regression method based on the 6S model and a large amount of typical surface spectral reflectance data. An empirical regression model is established to convert narrow-band reflectance to broadband albedo. This regression model is applied to surface reflectance obtained from UAV multispectral remote sensing sensors to ultimately derive surface albedo data with a spatial resolution of 0.2 meters.",
