      "description": "The data set contains the average contents of selenium in soil, drinking water, main grains (highland barley, tsamba, wheat, imported rice, etc.) and human hair in Kashin-Beck Disease endemic areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The data were mainly collected from all the relevant Chinese and English literatures published from 2000 to 2018, according to the strict literature screening criteria and quality evaluation by experts. Some of the data were collected from self-testing of samples. The monitoring values of different years in the same region (county or district) were integrated by the weighted average of the sample size and the average selenium content of the sample. This data set covers 39 counties affected with Kashin-Beck disease in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, basically covering the main areas of each endemic area. The effective sample sizes were more than 7000. It can reflect the average selenium level in the endemic areas of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at the present stage, and provide a data basis for the prevention and control of endemic diseases in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as well as the study of relationships between selenium and other related diseases.",
      "descriptionCn": "该数据集包含了青藏高原大骨节病流行区土壤、饮用水和主要粮食（青稞、糌粑、小麦、大米等）环境及人发中的硒元素平均含量。数据主要来源于2000-2018 年发表的所有相关中英文文献，依据严格的文献筛选标准和业内专家质量评价予以收集，部分来源于样品自测数据，对同一地区(县或区)不同年份的监测值采用样本量与样本硒平均含量的加权平均值进行整合。该数据集涉及青藏高原地区39个大骨节病病县，基本覆盖了各病区的主要区域，有效样本量大于7000个，能够反映青藏高原大骨节病流行区现阶段硒的平均水平，数据可为青藏高原地区地方病防控以及硒与其他相关疾病关系的研究提供数据基础。",
