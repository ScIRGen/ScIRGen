            "description": "To address the issue of observed precipitation bias caused by wind-induced undercatch on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), we constructed a precipitation phase division scheme and a precipitation adjustment scheme referring to the OTT Parsivel2 observations obtained from two stations, Wudaoliang and Tanggula, and applied the precipitation adjustment scheme to  daily precipitation observations at 78 meteorological observation stations on the QTP, with the original meteorological observation station The daily precipitation data were obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Center (http://data.cma.cn/). The adjusted daily precipitation data were organized into monthly precipitation, spatially interpolated using the ANUSPLIN interpolation method, and evaluated using the 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, the median of the ten interpolation results for each raster was taken as the monthly precipitation of the raster in millimeters (mm), with one decimal place. The data starts and ends from January 1981 to December 2017. The projection is Albers_Conical_Equal_Area with a spatial resolution of 1km.",

                    "Answer": "The use of laser disdrometers such as the OTT Parsivel2 helps in accurately measuring droplet size distribution and rainfall types, which are crucial for understanding wind-induced dynamic losses that affect precipitation observations. This data allows researchers to develop correction schemes tailored to the unique meteorological conditions of regions like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. By categorizing precipitation types and adjusting measured values accordingly, researchers can correct biases in observed precipitation data caused by wind conditions, enhancing the accuracy of meteorological records across 78 stations in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The need for correcting precipitation data in the Tibetan Plateau region arises from wind-induced dynamic losses that cause observational bias. The use of laser disdrometer data to develop a precipitation classification and correction scheme helps to address these biases. Applying these corrections to daily precipitation observations from meteorological stations improves the data quality and accuracy, which is crucial for climate models that rely on precise precipitation inputs to simulate weather patterns and predict climate changes accurately.",

This correction scheme is then applied to daily precipitation observations from 78 meteorological stations, with original data sourced from the National Meteorological Science Data Center. Corrected daily station data is aggregated into monthly precipitation, and spatial interpolation is performed using the ANUSPLIN thin plate spline method. The process is validated through ten-fold cross-validation, with the median of ten interpolation results taken as the monthly precipitation value for each grid cell.",
