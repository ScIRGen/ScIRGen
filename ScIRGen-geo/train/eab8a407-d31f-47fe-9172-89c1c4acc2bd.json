            "description": "The data set mainly includes EPMA data and some in-situ trace element data of skarn minerals in the Cuonadong W-Sn-Be deposit in Tibet. The analyzed skarn minerals include garnet, diopside, vesuvianite, scapolite, epidote, tremolite, phlogopite, tourmaline, etc. The EPMA analysis was carried out in the EPMA Laboratory of Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the in-situ trace element testing was carried out in the in-situ mineral geochemistry Laboratory of Hefei University of technology. The data quality meets the standard. The number of mineral ions has been calculated according to the chemical formula of mineral. The data are mainly used to explain the types of skarn minerals and the contents of beryllium and tin in the skarn minerals, and to explore the genetic mechanism of the W-Sn-Be skarn.",
