            "description": "This data set is typical specific emissivity data set of Heihe River Basin. Data observation is from March 25, 2014 to June 30, 2015.\nInstrument: Portable Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (102f), hand-held infrared thermometer            \nMeasurement method: 102f was used to measure the radiation values of cold blackbody, warm blackbody, observation target and gold plate. Using the radiation value of the cold and warm blackbody, the 102f is calibrated to eliminate the influence of the instrument's own emission. By using the iterative inversion algorithm based on smoothness, the specific emissivity and the object temperature are inversed. The specific emissivity range is 8-14 μ m, and the resolution is 4cm-1.            This data set contains the original radiation curves (in ASCII format) and recording files of cold blackbody, warm blackbody, measured target and gold plate obtained by 102f.",
