            "description": "This data includes the whole-rock major and trace geochemical data of Xiaru Nb-Ta-W enriched mineral, and radioisotope dating data of coltan, zircon, and monazite. The samples were collected from the Xiaru rock mass in central Tibet. The main geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, the trace element data are obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the major element data of niobium tantalum tungsten oxide minerals are obtained by electron microprobe analysis. Radioisotope dating of coltan, zircon, and monazite was obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Through the obtained data, the metallogenic age of Xiaru is determined, and the Nb and Ta content of granitic pegmatite of Xiaru rock body is determined to reach the cut-off grade.",

                    "Answer": "The collected geochemical data, including major and trace element analysis, along with isotopic dating, suggest that the granitic pegmatites in central Tibet are likely formed through complex petrogenetic processes involving partial melting and fractional crystallization. The presence of Nb-Ta-W oxide minerals and the isotopic dating results help to infer the timing of mineralization events and the geochemical environment during the formation of these rocks.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives behind collecting geochemical and isotopic data from these rock types in central Tibet are to determine the timing of mineralization processes and to assess the Nb-Ta content of granitic pegmatites, which reaches the boundary grade. These objectives influence the choice of data collection methods by necessitating precise analytical techniques such as X-ray fluorescence for major geochemical data, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for trace data, electron probe microanalysis for oxide mineral major data, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for radiometric dating. These methods are chosen to accurately characterize the geochemical composition and dating of the samples, which are critical to understanding the mineralization history and potential economic value of the region.",

The whole-rock major geochemical data is obtained using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, while trace element data is gathered through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Major element data for Nb-Ta-W oxide minerals are acquired using electron probe microanalysis. Radiometric dating of minerals such as columbite-tantalite, zircon, and monazite is performed using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These methods help determine the mineralization age of the Xuru region and assess the Nb-Ta content in granitic pegmatite.",
