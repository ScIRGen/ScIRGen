The artificial evaporator is a 20cm standard evaporator, and the precipitation is a 20cm standard rain gauge.\n2. Data content:\n(1) the evaporation capacity is measured at 20:00 every day with 20 special measuring cups;It is before a day commonly 20 when measure clear water 20 millimeter with special measure cup (original quantity) pour into implement inside, 24 hours hind namely in the same day 20 hour, again measure the water inside implement (allowance), its reduce quantity is evaporation quantity.Namely: evaporation = original quantity - residual quantity.If there is precipitation between 20:00 of the previous day and 20:00 of the same day, the calculation formula is: evaporation = original quantity + precipitation - residual quantity.\n(2) precipitation is generally observed in two stages, namely once at 8 o 'clock and once at 20 o 'clock each day. In the rainy season, observation periods are increased, and additional measurements are needed when the rainfall is large.The daily rainfall is divided into 8 a.m. of each day, and the precipitation from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m. of the next day is the precipitation of the current day.If it is rain, measure it with 20 special measuring cups. When it snows, only use the outer tube as snow bearing equipment, and then weigh it with an electronic balance (shenyang longteng es30k-12 type electronic balance, the minimum sensible amount is 0.2g).\n3.

        "Understanding cryospheric hydrology and the effects of cryospheric changes on river runoff is critical for sustainable water management especially in arid inland river basins such as those in northwest China where water resources mainly come from alpine areas. The Earth’s cryosphere is facing rapid changes in the duration, extent, and mass of snow and ice, which have had multiple impacts on the environment across a range of temporal and spatial scales. Changes in mountain snow, glaciers, and permafrost have resulted in significant downstream impacts in terms of the quantity, seasonality, and quality of water. This shrinkage has modified the water cycle and river discharge in cold regions and caused the rise of global mean sea level. Serving as a solid reservoir for many endorheic and exorheic basins, the mountain cryosphere is the regulator of major rivers and provides most of the water resources in arid regions in China and its neighboring countries. However, because of inadequate observation data and the lack of knowledge about many aspects of cryospheric hydrometeorology at regional scales in alpine regions, the significance of the impacts of cryospheric changes and the severity of their consequences remain unclear in China."

        "The scientific objective of the CHOICE is to obtain comprehensive observation data about environmental factors to determine the hydrological processes in a mountainous region and to evaluate the effects of climate, cryosphere, and land cover changes on mountainous hydrology and water resources in the lower arid regions. Four key science questions have been identified: The spatial and temporal distribution of alpine precipitation need to be determined. The effects of cryospheric changes on streamflow need to be determined. The effects of changes in the vegetation pattern in the vertical landscape zones on water balance and river runoff in the mountains must be assessed. A suitable distributed hydrological model including cryospheric hydrology is needed in mountainous areas."

        "Each AWS features the long-term monitoring of the following meteorological variables: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, four-component radiation, soil heat flux, land surface temperature (LST), soil temperature, soil moisture, snow depth, and precipitation amount. We also conducted long-term standard meteorological field (SMF) manual observations for reference to those obtained at AWS. The total discharge has been monitored by a continuously stream-gauging station at the catchment outlet since 2009. From 2009 to 2012, we also manually used the float protocol and a stopwatch to estimate the nonfreezing period discharge in a meadow subcatchment and a moraine–talus subcatchment. To apply hydrological models in the alpine catchment, we have obtained long-term continuous soil parameter data in the soil pit synchronously with those collected at AWS. An SI-111 infrared radiometer (Apogee Instr. Inc.) was used to measure the LST. During the early stage of the CHOICE, evapotranspiration was measured with two manual weighing microlysimeters, which were 40 cm in depth and 31.5 cm in diameter and were installed in the SMF at the Hulu-1 field on 1 July 2009 with an electronic scale of 2 g (0.026 mm) in precision. With the development of the CHOICE, five automatic microlysimeters (CHOICE-LYS40, T&D) were arranged in the same field as the AWS of the Hulu-1 to Hulu-5 field in August 2013. An EC150 system (Campbell Scientific Inc.) was installed on a lattice mast at 5.8 m at the Hulu-2 field in September 2011. Four cluster wells were installed in 2011 and 2014 for groundwater monitoring and sampling. On fixed-point scale, six SR50A Sonic Ranging Sensors (Campbell Scientific Inc.) measure snow depth synchronously with AWS. In this system, three thermistor cables were installed that crossed the riverbed–water, water–ice, and ice–air interfaces. We conduct the work of precipitation intercomparisons by referring to the Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment of the WMO using pit gauges and a double reference intercomparison reference (DFIR) gauge. Precipitation measurements in the Hulu catchment were performed with six total rain-weighing sensors (TRwS204, MPS System Ltd) with a single alter shield and synchronized with AWS. Fourteen LST observation sites with similar elevations but different aspects and slopes were built around the Hulu-3 field. Two LST observation sites were built to analyze the influences of plants on LST. To study the runoff process of canopy precipitation to surface runoff in different landscapes, two runoff fields (shrubs and meadows) (15 by 3 m) were established at a shrub-encroached alpine meadow hillslope in September 2010. Four methods were used to measure soil water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity in the Hulu-1 field including a single-ring infiltrometer, a double-ring infiltrometer, a Hood infiltrometer (Hood IL-2700, Germany), and the ring cutter method. Groundwater samples used for isotope analysis were collected from 12 wells between 2014 and 2016, and stream water samples were collected from 12 sites that were approximately evenly distributed from upstream to downstream between 2011 and 2016. A Picarro GasScouter G4301 gas concentration analyzer with a re-entry control system and six respiration chambers installed on the permafrost zone of the Hulu catchment in August 2017. The observation period of canopy precipitation interception began in June 2010. A total of four sap flow sensors (CAF, ECOMATIK) were installed to estimate transpiration. Variations in the diversity of the soil microbial community under meadow, shrub, marshy meadow, and moraine–talus were observed along an elevation gradient in the Hulu catchment in July 2013. An AWS was erected at the top of the glacier (4817 m asl) in September 2015; the site is not affected by the surrounding mountains. To obtain reliable turbulent data, EC system measurements were made adjacent to the AWS at a height of 4 m beginning in October 2017. To harvest the water contained in fog, five identical standard fog collectors were installed at Hulu-1 to Hulu-5 in July 2014. A warming simulation experiment was begun in September 2016. Two flight campaigns were performed in the Hulu catchment."

        "In recent years, a series of studies have been published using the CHOICE sharing platform data, and a number of researchers have used the CHOICE data for studies of alpine meteorology, cryospheric hydrology, groundwater, soils, and isotopes. According to the six AWS of the CHOICE obtained throughout the Hulu catchment and peripheral precipitation data from five China Meteorological Administration stations (Zhangye, Minle, Sunan, Qilian, and Yeniugou), two or more yearly EMPs exist in the northern Qilian Mountains. A diminished accumulation zone will result in a reduction in the transport and expansion of the glaciers, and then the glaciers will have to retreat to limit themselves to reduce ablation. Based on 10-yr observations in the western cold regions of China, especially those obtained in the Upper Hei River basin (UHR), a new CBHM was created to evaluate the effects of cryospheric changes on stream flow from the UHR. In the past 50 yr, river runoff has generally shown an increasing trend as a result of increased rainfall, snowfall, and glacial runoff in the cold regions of western China."
