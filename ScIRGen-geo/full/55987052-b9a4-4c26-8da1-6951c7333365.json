            "description": "The data are the whole rock major, trace element and Pb isotopic geochemical data of donggushan biotite granite in central Anhui Province, as well as in-situ Hf isotopic data of zircon, major, trace element and Sr isotopic data of scheelite and S isotopic data of pyrite. The samples are from donggushan biotite granite in central Anhui Province. The major element data were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the Pb isotopic composition data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis. Zircon U-Pb dating and in situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The major elements of scheelite were obtained by jxa8230 electron microprobe analysis, the trace elements by LA-ICP-MS analysis, and the in-situ Sr isotope of scheelite by MC-ICP-MS analysis. S isotope of pyrite was obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can be used to study the source, evolution and metallogenic process of donggushan tungsten deposit.",

                    "Answer": "Comprehensive geochemical and isotopic data from biotite granite formations can be obtained using several instrumental and procedural techniques. Major element data for whole rock samples are typically acquired through X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. Trace element and Pb isotopic compositions are determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu-Hf isotopic compositions are analyzed using Laser Ablation Multi-Collector ICP-MS (LA-MC-ICP-MS). For wolframite, major element analysis is conducted using an electron microprobe (JXA8230), trace elements are measured by LA-ICP-MS, and in-situ Sr isotopic data is acquired using MC-ICP-MS. Pyrite S isotopic data is also obtained using MC-ICP-MS. These methods allow for the investigation of the source, evolution, and mineralization processes of the ore-forming fluids in such formations.",
