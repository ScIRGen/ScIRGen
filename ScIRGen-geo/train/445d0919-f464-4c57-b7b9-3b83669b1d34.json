            "description": "Data Overview: Zhangye's channels are divided into five levels: dry, branch, bucket, agricultural and Mao channels, of which the agricultural channels are generally unlined. Mao channels are field projects, so the three levels of dry, branch and bucket channels and a small part of agricultural channels are mainly collected.  The irrigation canal system data includes 2 main canals (involving multiple irrigation districts), 157 main canals (within a single irrigation district), 782 branch canals and 5315 dou canals, with a total length of 8, 745.0km.\n\nData acquisition process: remote sensing interpretation and GPS field measurement are adopted for data acquisition of irrigation canal system.  Direct GPS acquisition channel is the most effective method, but the workload of GPS acquisition channel is too large, and we only verify the measurement in some irrigation areas.  The main method is to first collect the manual maps of irrigation districts drawn by each water pipe. Most of these maps have no location, only some irrigation districts such as Daman and Shangsan have been located based on topographic maps, and some irrigation districts in Gaotai County have used GPS to locate some channels.  Referring to the schematic diagram of the irrigation district, channel spatial positioning is carried out based on Quikbird, ASTER, TM remote sensing images and 1: 50000 topographic maps.  For the main canal and branch canal, due to the obvious linear features on remote sensing images and the general signs on topographic maps, it can be located more accurately.  For Douqu, areas with high-resolution images can be located more accurately, while other areas can only be roughly located according to fuzzy linear features of images and prompt information of irrigation district staff, with low positioning accuracy.  Each water management office simultaneously provides channel attribute data, which is one-to-one corresponding to spatial data.  After the first draft of the channel distribution map is completed, it is submitted twice to the personnel familiar with the channel distribution of each water pipe for correction. The first time is mainly to eliminate duplication and leak, and the second time is mainly to correct the position and perfect the attribute data.\n\nDescription of data content: The fields in the attribute table include code, district and county name, irrigation area name, channel whole process, channel name, channel type, location, total length, lined, design flow, design farmland, design forest and grass, real irrigation farmland, real irrigation forest and grass, water right area, and remarks.  Code example: G06G02Z15D01, where the first letter represents the county name, the 2nd and 3rd numbers represent the county (district) number, the 4th to 6th characters represent the trunk canal code, the 7th to 9th characters represent the branch canal code, and the 10th to 12th characters represent the dou canal code.",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method for mapping irrigation canal systems involved using both remote sensing interpretation and GPS field measurements. GPS was utilized for direct and effective channel data collection, but due to the extensive workload, it was only used for validation in certain irrigation districts. The primary approach was to gather manually drawn irrigation district schematics from various water management offices, which were mostly not georeferenced, except for a few districts like Daman and Shangsan. High-resolution satellite images and topographic maps were employed to spatially locate channels, with main and secondary channels being accurately identified due to clear linear features in the imagery and map markings. For smaller channels, high-resolution images allowed precise location in some areas, while in others, only approximate locations could be determined based on vague linear features and staff input.",

                    "Answer": "The significance of using both remote sensing interpretation and GPS field measurement in data collection for irrigation canal systems lies in the ability to efficiently and accurately gather spatial data about the canals. Remote sensing provides a way to identify linear features of the canals over large areas from satellite images like Quikbird, ASTER, and TM, combined with topographic maps. GPS, although labor-intensive, offers precise on-the-ground measurements to verify and refine the spatial data. This combination helps in creating accurate spatial representations of the canal systems, especially when high-resolution imagery is available for certain areas, enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the dataset.",

GPS provides precise data but is labor-intensive, so it is primarily used for verification. This dual approach ensures that even less visible features, like tertiary canals, can be mapped by leveraging high-resolution imagery and local knowledge, despite the lower positioning accuracy in some areas.",

Remote sensing offers an efficient way to spatially locate channels, especially for major channels like dry and branch channels, which have clear linear features on imagery and maps. GPS is used selectively to verify measurements in certain irrigation districts. This approach is cost-effective and allows for initial mapping that can be fine-tuned through submissions to local water management offices for correction and validation.",
