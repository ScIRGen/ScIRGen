            "description": "As the “water tower of Asia”, the Tibetan Plateau has a profound impact on the global natural environment and climate change. Therefore, analyzing the distribution characteristics of troposphere-stratospheric water vapor over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important part of understanding the water vapor source and change characterize. In situ observations are limit in this region, and the water vapor sounding data set is needed. Therefore, we carried out balloon-borne measurements at Lhasa and Kunming over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and then obtained the vertical distribution of water vapor in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The dataset is named “Pan-Third Pole Water Vapor Sounding”, which is mainly the water vapor profile data obtained by balloon sounding conducted at Lhasa and Kunming in August from July 2009 to 2019. Altitude (Altitude), Water vapor (H2O), temperature (Temp), potential temperature (K), and air pressure (Press) from near the surface to 20 km are obtained by conventional balloons soundings payloaded with the Cryogenic Frost Point Hygrometer (CFH) and radiosonde (iMet). Data is transmitted in real time to the ground receiving station via a radiosonde.",

Numerous studies, using satellite observations, show that the region within the anticyclone is associated with significantly enhanced tropospheric tracers, such as carbon monoxide, biomass burning products, aerosols, and water vapor. In addition, numerical simulations identify the ASM circulation to be a prominent boreal summer pathway of tropospheric air into the tropical stratosphere. The studies above have used satellite data and models, which often do not provide sufficiently resolved details for characterizing the transport process. The ASM anticyclone is a prominent circulation system in the Northern Hemisphere upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) in the summer season."

These new high-resolution and high-accuracy water vapor data are significant for quantifying the moisture transport associated with the ASM anticyclone, and the paired measurements of water vapor and ozone provide additional information for identifying the transport pathway. Results from the two locations within the ASM anticyclone are compared to differentiate the conditions in the center from those near the edge of the anticyclone. Similar measurements from an equatorial tropical location are used as a reference to contrast the region of anticyclone with the deep tropics."

The in situ observations therefore support the satellite-based conclusion that the ASM is an effective transport pathway for water vapor to enter the stratosphere. On average, both KM and LH have higher water vapor mixing ratios than the TC4 observations throughout the troposphere and stratosphere.

                "The tropical tropopause is recognized as a transitional zone between the troposphere and the stratosphere with finite thickness rather than a sharp boundary, known as the tropical \"tropopause transition layer\" (TTL). The TTL is defined as a thermal transition layer, and its boundaries are identified from the profiles of temperature and potential temperature lapse rates only, which is particularly suited to balloon-borne measurements. The TTL can be identified from the tracer-tracer relationships. Mixing affects the transport of chemical constituents and is a key mechanism for irreversible stratosphere-troposphere exchange. The study of Pan et al. (2014) shows that the tracer-relationship based TTL is consistent with the thermal definition of the TTL, for which the LMS and CPT are the lower and upper boundaries of thermally-based TTL. It has been recognized in recent years that significant transport of air and pollutants from the surface into the stratosphere also occurs over the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) regions. It is crucial for global chemistry climate models to properly represent the thermodynamic structure and properties of the TTL within the ASM anticyclone, thus an in-depth study of the distribution and transport of atmospheric composition in that layer will provide more information on the transport processes from the troposphere into the stratosphere within the ASM anticyclone region, particularly the role of convection in cross-tropopause exchange."

In our analysis, the water vapor profiles are processed using the method of variable Gaussian filter. For the ozone data, we use time response corrected data, which removes a slight relative shift between the ozone measurements and the other faster response measurements.

                    "Answer": "Water vapor sounding refers to the process of measuring the vertical distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere, particularly from the near surface to the stratosphere. In the context of the Tibetan Plateau, this involves using balloon-borne instruments like Cryogenic Frostpoint Hygrometers (CFH) and radiosondes to collect data on altitude, water vapor, temperature, pressure, and potential temperature up to 20 km in height.",

Both methods provide high-resolution data, but the CFH is particularly noted for its accuracy in measuring water vapor, which is crucial for studying the transport of moisture in the troposphere and stratosphere. The ECC, paired with CFH, allows for integrated measurements of ozone and water vapor, providing a comprehensive profile of atmospheric conditions.",
