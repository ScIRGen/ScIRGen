The history of atmospheric mercury deposition since the industrial revolution was reconstructed based on 8 lake cores and 1 ice core from the Tibetan Plateau and the southern slope of the Himalayas.This data set contains 8 lake core data from Namtso, Bangongtso, Linggatso, Guanyong Lake, Tanggula Lake, Gosainkunda Lake, Gokyo Lake and Phewa Lake, and 1 ice core data .The resolution of ice core data is 1 year, lake core data is 2~20 years, and the data include mercury concentration and flux.",

                    "Answer": "Ice cores and lake cores are effective methods for reconstructing atmospheric mercury transmission and deposition history in the Tibetan Plateau due to their ability to capture long-term environmental records. The ice core from Geladangdong offers a high-resolution annual record, while the lake cores provide longer-term data spanning 2 to 20 years, offering a comprehensive view of historical mercury levels.",

                    "Answer": "The difference in temporal resolution allows for a detailed annual analysis of mercury deposition using ice cores, offering a clear year-by-year understanding of historical trends. However, the longer time spans covered by lake cores can provide broader historical context over decades or even centuries. The limitation lies in the lake cores' potentially lower resolution, which may miss finer temporal variations, while ice cores may not span as long a period but offer precise data for recent centuries.",

Ice cores offer high-resolution data with annual resolution, while lake sediment cores provide data with a resolution ranging from 2 to 20 years. This combination allows for a comprehensive temporal understanding of mercury deposition over a broad historical timeline.",
