            "description": "This data is the chronological, magnetic, grain size and bulk density data of Zhouqu (ZQ) loess paleosol sequence in the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). We measured the magnetic susceptibility, grain size and bulk density data of the profile at 5 cm intervals. All the experimental analysis was completed at the Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University, China. The OSL ages were determined by an automated Risø TL/OSL DA-20 reader. The magnetic susceptibility was measured by Bartington MS2 magnetic susceptibility meter; The grain size data were measured by a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer; The bulk density data were determined by according to the oil-soaked method; The data set show the variation characteristics of magnetic susceptibility, grain size and bulk density of loess sequence in the eastern TP since the last glacial period, which plays an important role in studying the paleoenvironment, paleoclimate, dust accumulation history and its relationship with the surrounding atmospheric circulation in the eastern TP.",
