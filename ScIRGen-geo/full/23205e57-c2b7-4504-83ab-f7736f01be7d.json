            "description": "The medical service capacity of a region is an important indicator to measure its social development status and regional sustainable development. Building a more high-quality and efficient medical service capacity in the Sanjiangyuan National Park area is one of the essential economic and social development goals of the region. This dataset uses the number of medical beds available to each resident in the region to evaluate their medical service capacity. Firstly, by using the method of network crawling and combining with the medical and health institution data obtained by the Qinghai Provincial Health Commission, the spatial distribution point information of medical institutions in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and its surrounding counties in 2015 and 2020 was obtained. Secondly, based on information such as the establishment time, medical personnel, and number of beds of each hospital, and referring to the \"Hospital Grading Management Standards\", the medical institutions within the scope of Sanjiangyuan National Park are classified. Afterwards, according to the \"Outline of the National Medical and Health Service System Planning\" and the theory of sustainable development, spatial analysis tools were applied in ArcGIS software to obtain the 50km, 100km, 150km, 200km, and 500km medical institution service coverage buffer zones of all hospitals within the Sanjiangyuan National Park in 2015 and 2020. The regional medical service intensity was obtained based on factors such as buffer zone range and road accessibility. Finally, using the population spatial distribution kilometer grid dataset and dividing it by the above spatial distribution data of medical service intensity, the actual spatial distribution data of medical service capacity within the scope of Sanjiangyuan National Park for 2015 and 2020 were obtained.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method for both 2015 and 2020 involved web scraping and acquiring data from the Qinghai Province Health Commission to gather spatial distribution information of healthcare institutions in the 三江源国家公园 area. Both years utilized the same methodology, including the classification of institutions based on establishment time, staff, and bed numbers, and applying spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS to determine service coverage areas. Consequently, there is no reported difference in the data collection methods between the two years.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution and accessibility of healthcare services in 三江源国家公园 can be inferred by examining the changes in the coverage areas of medical institutions at different distances (50km, 100km, 150km, 200km, and 500km) over the years 2015 and 2020. By analyzing these changes, one can assess the improvements or deficiencies in healthcare infrastructure and accessibility. The data collection involved scraping data from online sources and integrating information from the Qinghai Province Health and Wellness Committee, which provided spatial distribution data of medical institutions. The analysis used spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS to establish service coverage areas, accounting for factors such as road accessibility, which contributed to understanding the regional medical service intensity and its development over time. This approach allows researchers to draw conclusions about the progress and distribution effectiveness in meeting healthcare needs in the region.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating data from multiple sources, like web scraping and official records, can provide a comprehensive view of the spatial distribution of healthcare services, which may lead to more accurate assessments of regional healthcare service capacity. This approach could help in identifying gaps in service coverage, enhancing the understanding of accessibility, and informing targeted improvements in healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, it may improve the granularity and reliability of the data, leading to more effective planning and resource allocation in the 三江源国家公园 area.",

                    "Answer": "To collect and evaluate spatial distribution data of healthcare facilities in a national park area over different years, one can start by using web scraping techniques combined with official health committee data to gather information on healthcare institutions. This includes obtaining point location data of these institutions for the years of interest. Next, categorize the healthcare facilities by considering factors such as establishment year, staff numbers, and bed capacity, following hospital grading standards. Utilize spatial analysis tools in software like ArcGIS to create service coverage buffers at various distances around each facility. Finally, use population distribution grid data to assess the spatial distribution of healthcare service capacity.",
