            "description": "1) The data includes the soil erosion modulus of 11 watersheds with a resolution of 5 m in the year of 2017 in Tibet. 2）Based on the surface layer of rainfall erosivity R, soil erodibility K, slope length factor LS, vegetation coverage FVC, and rotation sampling survey unit, the Chinese soil erosion model (CSLE) was used to calculate soil erosin modulus in 11 watersheds respectively. Through spatial data processing (including chart linking and transformation, vector-grid conversion, and resampling),  R, K, LS factors were calculated from the regional thematic map of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and DEM. By half-month FVC, NPV, half-month rainfall erosivity data, we calculated the value of B factors  in each sampling watershed. The value of E factor was calculated based on the remote sensing interpretation results and engineering measure factor table. The value of tillage factor T was obtained from tillage zoning map and tillage measure table. And then the soil erosion modulus in each sampling watershed was calculated by the equation: A=R•K•LS•B•E•T. The selection of 11 watersheds was based on the layout of sampling survey in pan-third polar region. 3) Compared with the data of soil erosion intensity in the same region in the same year, there is no significant difference and the data quality is good.4) the data of soil erosion modulus is of great significance for studying the present situation of soil erosion in Pan third polar region, and it is also crucial for the implementation of the development policy of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.",

                    "Answer": "Using the CSLE method with high-resolution data inputs such as 5-meter resolution data allows for detailed and precise calculation of soil erosion modulus, potentially leading to more accurate assessments of soil erosion conditions. This approach integrates various factors like rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length, and vegetation cover derived from spatial data operations. The method's accuracy is further supported by comparisons with existing soil erosion intensity data from the same region and year, showing no significant differences, thus affirming the quality of the data.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve using the CSLE method where factors such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), and vegetation cover (FVC) are considered. Spatial data operations include converting thematic maps of rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility, as well as DEMs, into sampling unit factors R, K, LS through processes like resampling and vector-raster conversions. Additionally, factors for different land types are calculated using semi-monthly FVC, NPV, rainfall erosivity weights, and other land-use B factors. Engineering measures factor values and tillage factors are determined from remote sensing interpretation results, engineering measures factor tables, tillage zoning maps, and tillage measures tables. These processes culminate in calculating the soil erosion modulus for each sampling unit in selected small watersheds.",
