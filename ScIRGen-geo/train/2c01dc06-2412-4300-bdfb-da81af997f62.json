            "description": "The data set mainly includes the main and trace element data of the medium basic rocks in Zhegu Town, Shannan City, Cuomei Large Igneous Province, southern Tibet, and the Linzizong volcanic rocks in the eastern section of the Lhasa terrane. This data is mainly used to study the origin of Labanian intermediate rocks in the large igneous province, which is of great significance to discuss why the large igneous province lacks intermediate rocks; It is of great significance to study the petrogenesis of volcanic rocks in the collision zone and the origin of temporal and spatial variations of enriched components in magma for using petrological evidence to constrain the time limit of Indo Eurasian collision. A total of 24 pieces of electron probe data were tested, excluding duplicate sample testing. The testing unit is Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data comes from published articles, which are true and reliable. It can be applied to the study of magmatic rock genesis.",
