            "description": "The time-continuous reflectance spectra measurements were implemented within the growing duration in typical agriculture test sites of China, including Changchun, Zhangye, and Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The measurements in Changchun were carried out in 2016. Several typical vegetation types such as maize, rice, wheat, potato, soybean, and mungbean were included. The number of sampling days ranged from 10 to 16, distributed across the whole growing season. The vegetation temporal dynamic reflectance spectra in Zhangye were collected in 2013. The measured vegetation types included rape, barely, corn, and onion, and the number of sampling days ranged between 9 and 12. For each vegetation type, there were as least two reflectance spectra measurements for each month during the experimental period. In this way, the measured reflectance spectra of these vegetation nearly represent the temporal dynamics in the growing season. The measurements in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture were also conducted in 2013. Only the reflectance spectra of grassland were collected from May to September. And there were 13 sampling days. The spectral distribution of each specific target is estimated as the average of all reflectance distributions. In order to collect smooth and continuous spectral curves, the least squares polynomial fitting algorithm is applied to remove the abnormal fluctuations in the vapor absorption channel, and the spectral curves are interpolated to 1 nm spectral resolution using piecewise linear interpolation functions. This dataset can support the development of the modeling of plant growth and vegetation phenology, and the retrieval of surface biophysical and biochemical parameters. Moreover, they can serve as a reference truth for satellite observations in validation.",
            "instructions": "For each vegetation type, all data were organized in a folder named \"AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDD HHMMSS\". \"AAAA\" is set to \"spec\", \"BBBB_CCCC\" refers to the name of land cover type and object, and \"YYYYMMDD HHMMSS\" displays the time of measurement. The observation data file is processed in TXT format, the metadata file is processed in XML format, and the satellite data and quick view were set in Tiff and JPEG formats respectively. As for the name of each spectral data, the file name is recorded as “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_XXXX”, where the “XXXX” shows the file type, “A000” means the data file, and “B000” means the auxiliary file of XML. The “AAAA” represents the spectral types, where “refl”, “emis”, and “mwra” denote the reflectance, emissivity, and microwave emissivity, respectively. And the “pixel”, “img”, and “view” represent the satellite pixel spectral, the satellite image, and the quick-view image, respectively. Regarding the name of the metadata, “AAAA” was set as “comp” and “pixel”. “comp” refers to the scene information of the spectra, and “pixel” indicates the information of satellite pixel spectral.",

                "However, there are several limitations to the exiting libraries. First, they provide spectra in shortwave, infrared, or microwave domains separately. This discontinuity does not meet the requirements for developing a unified spectral-domain radiative transfer model and its associated applications. Second, they rarely measure (and release) anisotropic spectra across different spectral domains. Nevertheless, apparent anisotropy exists in the surface reflectivity in the VNIR-SWIR spectral domain (e.g., bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)), emissivity in the TIR spectral domain (e.g., directional bright temperature), and reflectivity or emissivity in the microwave spectral domains (e.g., directional microwave radiation). Ignoring the directionality of satellite observations may lead to large errors in the retrieval of remote sensing radiation and vegetation structure variables. Therefore, the multi-angular spectra are a pressing need to advance the estimation of surface energy budget and modeling of land surface processes. Third, there is a lack of multiscale spectra measurements (e.g., leaf and canopy spectra), which hinders the understanding of cross-scale physical radiative transfer and associated ecological processes. Hence, the collection of multiscale spectra is much needed to help improve the understanding of cross-scale radiative transfer processes from individual leaves to canopies and even ecosystems and promote the exploration of scaling effects on ecological processes (e.g., upscaling plant function traits). Furthermore, the temporal dynamic spectra for typical vegetation are insufficient. Given the fact that the vegetation dynamics are crucial for modeling land cover change and plant phenology as well as its feedback to climate change, vegetation spectra across different growth stages need to be further supplemented in order to improve the monitoring and modeling of land cover and land use change, and surface phenology in general."

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods across different sites in China show variations in both frequency and duration of sampling.

Similarly, at the Zhangye site, measurements were conducted over 9 to 12 days with each vegetation type measured at least twice a month. In contrast, the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture site observed grassland spectral data over a total of 13 days from May to September. These differences in data collection methods reflect diverse strategies tailored to specific regional or vegetation characteristics and objectives of the study.",
