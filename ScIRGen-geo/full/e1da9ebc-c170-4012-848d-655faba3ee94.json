The transmitter (E100°28′16.4″, N38°03′24.3″, 11.2m) and the receiver (E100°27′25.9″, N38°02′18.1″, 11.5m) were 2390m away from each other and the operating altitude was 9.5m. The observation item was the atmospheric refractive index structural parameters  (Cn2). The transmitting frequency was 5HZ and the data were output per minute. The processed data were archived in a 30 minutes cycle. \n     The data were named after WATER_LAS_A'rou_yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd.csv (yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd for observation time). The missing data were marked \"None\".",

Remote sensing is by far the only technique that is able to provide H and LE information at a regional scale with various spatio-temporal resolutions. Many methods have been developed in the past using remote sensing data to estimate H and LE, such as the SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System, Su, 2002), SEBI (Surface Energy Balance Index, Roerink et al., 2000), SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land, Bastiaanssen, 2000), TSEB (Two Source Energy Balance, Norman et al., 1995) model, METRIC (Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internal Calibration, Allen et al., 2007) model, and TVT (Temperature and Vegetation Index Triangle, Moran et al., 1994). The most important step, subsequent to the estimation of H and LE by remote sensing models, is to validate the results, which is not an easy task due to the lack of accurate and frequent ground observations that is in sync with the spatial resolution of the space-borne remote sensing data (Jia et al., 2003). The SEBS model, proposed by Su (2002), is one of the most important and widely used single-source models for estimating H and LE (Rwasoka et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2009)."

The largest rmse and over-estimation in H occur in June, which could most likely be attributed to high delta T, high wind speed, and the complicated thermodynamic state during the transitional period when bare land transforms to dense vegetation cover."

Remote sensing data, combined with the ground meteorological observations (pressure, temperature, wind speed, humidity) are fed into the SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) model. We estimated H with the SEBS model over the Alpine grass region in the Qinghai Province of China. The LAS instrument is installed at Arou County, east of the Qinghai province, at an altitude of approximately 3000 m. The LAS makes measurements along a path between the transmitter (38◦03′24.3′′N, 100◦28′16.4′′E) and receiver (38◦02′18.1′′N, 100◦27′25.9′′E), with the distance being 2390 m. The meteorological observation tower (38◦02′39.8′′N, 100◦27′53.1′′E) is installed between the LAS transmitter and receiver. Remote sensing products for the VIRR sensor, namely, LST, emissivity and NDVI are available and can be downloaded from the web at http://satellite.cma.gov.cn/PortalSite/Ord/Satellite.aspx. From the overpass time of the TERRA and FY3A satellites, we determined the meteorological parameters for the MODIS and VIRR data, respectively. Meteorological observations, namely, wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, and pressure, together with the LST, NDVI, z0m, Rn, emissivity, reference height (10 m), and HPBL (1 km), were then fed into the SEBS model to calculate H."

                "Sensible and latent heat fluxes are important indicators reflecting the intensity of heat and water vapor exchange between the land and atmosphere, affecting the energy balance between them. They provide material, dynamic, and thermal sources for weather systems of different scales and influence the water cycle process between the land and atmosphere. Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness of only tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS matches well with satellite pixel scales and the grid scales of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth at the pixel/grid scale for remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."

The mechanism of radar backscattering from soils is complicated and strongly influenced by surface roughness. Surface soil moisture (mv) is important in agronomic, hydrological, and meteorological processes at all spatial scales. It plays a key role in water stress detection and irrigation management, especially for arid and semi-arid regions. It is well known that space-borne microwave radiometers and scatterometers possess the advantage of high revisit capacity but deficient in coarse spatial resolution. On the contrary, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have the capability to provide finer spatial resolution, on the order of tens of meters, meeting most spatial requirements for watershed management and hydrological applications. Radar systems emit pulses and receive echoes backscattered from the illuminated areas. The intensity value of each pixel is proportional to the radar backscattering coefficient (σ0), which depends on several factors, including the instrument’s technical specifications (frequency and polarization), terrain, dielectric characteristics (εr; strongly related to the soil water content) and the geometrical structure (roughness) of the target surface. The IEM unites the KA and the SPM and was verified by laboratory measurements of bistatic scattering from surfaces with small, intermediate and large scale roughness. The advanced IEM (AIEM) improves the calculation accuracy of scattering coefficient by keeping the absolute phase term in Greens function which was neglected by IEM. In the IEM and AIEM, surface roughness is an essential input."
