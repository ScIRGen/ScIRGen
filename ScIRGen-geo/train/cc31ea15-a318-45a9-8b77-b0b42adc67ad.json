            "description": "Provide the spatial distribution of the annual emissions of BC, CH4, CO2, CO, NH3, NMVOC, NOx, OC and SO2 from agriculture, energy exploitation, industrial and fuel combustion, surface transportation, residential and commercial housing, solvent production, waste disposal and international shipping in China from 1990 to 2015, in kg/m2/yr. The spatial precision is 0.5 °, and the geographic coordinate system is WGS84. The data comes from the CEDs data set. The historical homogenized land use data of China is obtained by linear time interpolation, Chinese regional mask extraction and coordinate system transformation of the original data, and saved in geotiff file format. The methods and standards of data over the years are consistent, the coverage is complete, and the collection and processing process is traceable and reliable.",
            "instructions": "File name: the air pollutant emission data is stored in GeoTIFF format. The file name is \"airpollutantname_em_anthro_yyyy_sector_sectorname\", where airpollutantname stands for the name of the air pollutant, yyyy stands for the year, and sectorname stands for the name of the emission source department. For example, BC_ em_ anthro_ 1990_ sector_ Agr.tif describes the situation of black carbon (BC) emissions from China's agricultural sector in 1990.\nData reading method: it can be opened with ArcGIS, R / Python and other programming languages. The unit is kg / m2 / yr.",

                    "Answer": "The need for historical homogenization of China's land-use data arises to ensure consistent and reliable spatial distribution assessments of air pollutant emissions across various sectors such as agriculture, energy extraction, and industrial activities over time. This process involves time-linear interpolation, extraction using China-specific masks, and coordinate system transformation to maintain methodological consistency and data reliability.",

                    "Answer": "The use of historical linear interpolation and coordinate transformation can ensure that the data is temporally consistent and spatially precise. It allows for the creation of a standardized dataset that is comparable across years and regions, improving the reliability of the data. However, it may also introduce uncertainties if the interpolation assumptions do not perfectly match the actual historical trends or if the coordinate transformations lead to slight misalignments. The spatial resolution of 0.5° is maintained, providing a balance between detail and computational manageability.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods ensure reliability and traceability by employing time linear interpolation, regional masking extraction for China, and coordinate system transformation. These steps are consistently applied across all years, ensuring a uniform approach. The historical data is then saved in geotiff format, maintaining spatial resolution and geographic coordinate system standards, which contributes to its traceable and reliable nature.",
