The dataset is stored in HDF5 file format, and each HDF5 file contains 18 data elements, which include data values, data start date, latitude,  and longitude. Meanwhile, for a quick preview of snow distribution, the day-by-day file contains snow area thumbnails stored in jpg format. This dataset will be continuously supplemented and improved based on real-time satellite remote sensing data and algorithm updates (currently through December 2020),  and will be shared in a fully open sharing format.",

                "Snow is one of the most active elements on the land surface. Because of its unique properties of high shortwave reflectivity, low longwave emissivity, and high phase-change latent heat, its covering may significantly alter the surface radiation budget, exchanges of energy and moisture between the atmosphere and the surface, and thereby our climate and weather systems. In addition, seasonal snow is an important supply source, providing precious freshwater for many arid and semiarid regions. Snow-cover extent (SCE), therefore, is an indispensable parameter in climatic, weather, hydrological, environmental, and other related studies. With the development and progress of space technology, satellite remote sensing has become a primary option to monitor snow-cover conditions on the Earth. In particular, as one of the most successful satellite missions, since it launched in 1999, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been widely used to acquire SCE information from regional to global scales. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) routinely produces and continually updates the standard MODIS snow products. Before the C6 version, there were only two sets of standard snow products – MOD10A1 and MYD10A1, which provide conventional SCE information only under clear skies. Since there are abundant cloud-induced gaps in the products, they in fact can not give the complete SCE knowledge. In the standard MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 products, the core is datasets of the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)."

Compared with the standard snow products, the following improvements are reached: (1) varying NDSI thresholds with land-cover types are obtained by a volume of training data; (2) the approach that combines the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Forest Snow Index (NDFSI) is adopted to improve snow discrimination in forest areas; (3) NDSI is computed using surface reflectance instead of TOA reflectance; (4) a gap-filling technique based on a hidden Markov random field (HMRF) is used to reduce cloud-induced gaps, which can assimilate temporally and spatially adjacent information simultaneously."

First, several studies have shown that the optimal NDSI threshold may vary with land-cover types, and using a fixed value for global products, regardless of 0.4 or 0.1, may lead to considerable uncertainty. Second, standard MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 products often exhibit large errors in forest areas."

For the aggregated SCE data, we will adopt the method based on the spatiotemporal hidden Markov random field (HMRF) proposed by Huang et al. (2018) to further fill gaps. Using the new snow discrimination algorithm developed for clear skies in Sect. 3.1, we produce a new Terra-MODIS SCE dataset and a new Aqua-MODIS SCE dataset over China with MOD09GA and MYD09GA products as the main inputs. Next, based on the two clear-sky datasets above, we produce a new CGF SCE dataset using the new cloud-gap-removing algorithm developed in Sect. 3.2."

Bias values of 0.98, 1.02, and 1.03 demonstrate on a whole that there is no significant overestimation nor a significant underestimation. Based on the same ground reference data, we found that the new product accuracies are obviously higher than standard MODIS snow products, especially for Aqua-MODIS and CGF SCE. An isolated validation at four forest CMA stations demonstrates that the OA has increased by 3–10 percentage points, the OE has dropped by 1–8 percentage points, and the CE has dropped by 4–21 percentage points."
