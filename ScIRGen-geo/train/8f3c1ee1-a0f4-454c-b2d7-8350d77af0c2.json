This method allows for precise measurement of the snow backscatter coefficient and other snow parameters such as surface temperature, snow grain size, density, and albedo. These observations facilitate a deeper understanding of snow properties, which can improve the accuracy of remote sensing models and contribute to more effective monitoring and prediction of snow-related phenomena.",

Additionally, total radiometers are used for albedo measurement, and a snow characteristic analyzer is employed to measure snow density, complex dielectric constant, snow volumetric moisture content, and snow gravimetric moisture content. These observations are conducted in specified locations as recorded by GPS, ensuring precise data collection in the field.",
