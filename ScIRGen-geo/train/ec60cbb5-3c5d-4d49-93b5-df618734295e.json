Data from published articles: Zhang, J., Zhao, B., Wang, D., Yu, J., and tan, K. (2021), dynamic modeling of postseismic deformation following the 2015 MW 7.8 Gorkha earth, Nepal, J. Asian Earth SCI., 215104781, Doi: 10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.104781. The post earthquake deformation data processing process is as follows: firstly, the original observation data are processed to obtain the time series under ITRF reference frame; Then, other effects unrelated to the Nepal earthquake, such as seasonal variation, interannual variation, plate effect, etc., are corrected; Thirdly, the post earthquake time series curve is fitted by logarithmic function; Finally, the post earthquake deformation of any period is calculated by fitting the curve. Five years after the earthquake, the accumulated deformation is nearly 13.8 cm. The horizontal accuracy is not less than 0.6cm, and the vertical accuracy is not less than 2.0cm.",

Records show that there have been a handful of strong earthquakes along the central Himalaya arc, such as the 1505 Mw > 8.2 Lo Mustang earthquake, 1833 Mw 7.7 Kathmandu earthquake, 1934 Mw 8.2 Bihar-Nepal earthquake. Postseismic transient deformation of mantle and crustal rocks is the mechanical response to stress perturbations generated by large earthquakes. The primary mechanisms of postseismic stress relaxation comprise aseismic slip in the periphery of the coseismic rupture area and viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle and poroelastic rebound in the shallow crust around the fault. In recent decades, more and more geophysicists have employed three-dimensional finite element method to simulate postseismic evolution, which can solve some problems that are challenging to the traditional analytical or semi-analytical methods."

In this work, we present three-dimensional finite-element models (FEM) consisting of subducting Indian slab to constrain the rheological properties of the lower crust in the southern Tibetan Plateau and the frictional properties of the MHT using dense GPS observations spanning nearly 5 years both in Nepal and the southern Tibet."

There was almost no data at approximately 150 – 250 km (intermediate-field) from the rupture area in Tibet. There are still several controversies about the distribution of the inferred afterslip and the Indian-Asian tectonic plate boundary below Tibet. In addition, most of the aforementioned postseismic modeling effects of the Gorkha earthquake adopted analytic or semi-analytic methods of dislocations theory in a homogeneous or layered elastic half-space. There may be a bias in their slip models due to the strong lateral heterogeneous rheological structure in the study area."

The steady-state viscosity of the lower crust in the southern Tibet is estimated to be 3 × 10^18 Pa s, corresponding transient-state viscosity is 3 × 10^17 Pa s. The best-fit combined model suggests that approximately 90% afterslip was released in the first 4 years and corresponding frictional parameter a σ = 0.15 MPa. Additionally, we find the afterslip fringing the downdip of the coseismic rupture plays an important role in the trade-off between near- and intermediate-field displacements. Afterslip deficit in the shallow part of the Main Himalayan Thrust indicates the potential seismic hazard on the south and west of Kathmandu in future."
