            "description": "This dataset includes soil moisture, soil temperature and land surface temperature observations of 50 WATERNET wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes during the period from May to September 2012, which is one type of WSN nodes in the Heihe eco-hydrological wireless sensor network (WSN). The WATERNET located in the 4×4 MODIS grids in the observation matrix in the Zhangye oasis. Each WATERNET node observes the soil moisture, soil temperature, soil conductivity and complex dielectric constant at 4 cm and 10 cm depths by the Hydra Probe II sensor. There are 29 nodes among the WATERNET with the SI-111 sensor at 4 m height to measure the surface radiance temperature. The operational observation interval is 10 minutes, and the intensive observation mode with 1 minute is activated during 00:00-04:30, 08:00-18:00 and 21:00-24:00 (UTC+8), in order to synchronize with airborne or satellite-borne remote sensors. This dataset can be used in the estimation of surface hydrothermal variables and their validation, eco-hydrological research, irrigation management and so on.\nThe detail description please refers to \"WATERNET_Data_Document_HRBMiddle.docx”.",
