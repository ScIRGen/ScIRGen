      "description": "Tree cores of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) in central and eastern Qilian Mountains were collected. The samples were measured using the Velmex measuring system with a precision of 0.001 mm. To ensure the accuracy of dating, the results were tested with CHFECHA and TASP program. The computer program ARSTAN was used for detrending and for calculating the tree-ring chronologies. Conventional straight lines and negative exponential curves were used to detrend most of the tree-ring series, but a cubic smoothing spline with a 67% of the series length was used in a few cases if the previous two curves did not provide a good fit. Finally, tree-ring chronologies were obtained.",
