            "description": "The data set involved geodetic annual glacier-averagedmass balance and mass change data at the Ponkar area in Nepal on the Southern slope of the Himalayas from 1974 to 2014. It is stored in the ESRI vector polygon format and is composed of two periods, which includes surface elevation difference between 1974-2000 (DH1974-2000, from KH-9 DEM1974 and SRTM DEM2000), surface elevation difference between 2000-2014 (DH2000-2014,by DinSAR techniques from SRTM DEM2000 and TSX/TDX data in 2014). KH-9 DEM is a DEM of the study area in 1974, which was generated from three scenes of optical stereo pairs from KH-9. Geodetic glacier mass change was calculated by DH above, glacier cover vector data from TPG1976/CGI2/RGI6.0 with ice density of 850 ± 60 kg m−3. The attribute data included: GLIMSId means the glacier code from GLIMS data base, the glacier_area（m2）、Area（km2）, the glacier name, EC74_2000, the surface elevation change rate from 1974 to 2000(m a-1), EC00_2014, the surface elevation change rate from 2000 to 2014 (m a-1), MB74_2000, the geodetic glacier mass balance between 1974 and 2000（m w.e. a-1），MB00_2014, the geodetic glacier mass balance between 2000 and 2014（m w.e. a-1）.MC74_2000, the geodetic glacier mass change from 1974 to 2000 (m3w.e. a-1), MC00_2014, the geodetic glacier mass change from 2000 to 2014(m3w.e. a-1). Ut_EC74_00 is the uncertainty of glacier surface elevation change（m a-1） in 1974-2000、Ut_MB74_00, is the uncertainty of glacier mass balance for each glacier（m w.e. a-1）in 1974-2000，Ut_MC74_00, is the uncertainty of glacier mass change for each glacier（m3w.e. a-1）in 1974-2000. Ut_EC00_14，is the uncertainty of glacier surface elevation change in 2000-2014（m a-1），Ut_MB00_14，is the uncertainty of glacier mass balance for each glacier in 2000-2014（m w.e. a-1），Ut_MC00_14 is the uncertainty of glacier mass change for each glacier in 2000-2014（m3 w.e. a-1）. This data set is used for the study glaciers melting and its hydrological effects in Ponkar area in Nepal in the Southern slope of the Himalayas.

                "It is well known that glaciers in mountains are retreating widely in a warmer climate during recent decades on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The runoffs from both glaciers and glacier lakes have been increased significantly, and the potential outbursts of glacier lakes have threatened the residence safety in China and the adjacent countries. However, most of the glaciers locate in very distant mountains. As glaciers are difficult to be investigated due to the huge investments and long traveling time of field surveys, remote sensing monitoring has been the major approach adopted to understand the changes of glaciers nowadays. Mountain glaciers, especially those in temperate regions, are considered one of the best natural indicators of climate change. In recent years, the contribution of glaciers to the rise in lake and sea levels has also received increasing attention, with global glacier melting contributing 29±13% to sea level rise, and global glaciers and ice caps contributing 61±19% to sea level rise. The Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent mountain regions have developed glaciers covering an area of about 50,000 km², which is the largest glacier area in the mid-low latitude region outside the polar regions, and is the source of many famous rivers in Asia, as well as a precious water resource in the arid inland areas. Glacier activity is an important factor inducing glacier debris flow, ice/snow avalanches, and glacier lake outburst floods, with glacier floods often being one of the most impactful glacier disasters. For example, glacier melting leads to the formation and expansion of moraine lakes, and glacier flood disasters caused by moraine or ice-dammed lakes frequently occur, posing catastrophic threats to the safety of life and property in the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan regions, affecting countries like China, India, and Nepal. Therefore, with the deepening of global change research, studies on glacier changes (including area, thickness, and ice reserves) are becoming increasingly important, with significant implications for global water resources and climate change, as well as disaster warning."

In the past few decades, remote sensing technology has overcome the limitations of past field survey scope and measured data, greatly shortening the survey cycle, saving survey costs, and improving survey efficiency. However, due to the lack of ground glacier survey data for verification, and the \"change noise\" existing between multi-source data classification results, there are still many challenges in the automatic mapping of glaciers and their changes.
