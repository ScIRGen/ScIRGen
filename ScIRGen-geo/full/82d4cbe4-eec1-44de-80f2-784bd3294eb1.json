            "description": "This dataset comprises fossil specimens of Cenozoic mammal collected from Tibetan Plateau and surrounding area, such as Suerkal Basin in A-erh-chin Mountains, Tabenbuluk in Gansu Province, during 2018-04-01 to 2018-10-01. Most of the specimens were collected in surface of section, part were excavated from shallow strata. All of the specimens were sent to Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, cleaned by technician and photographed with digital camera. The specimens are well-preserved and can be easily observed  on important characters of the individuals they belong to. The specimens of this data set are all new ones unstudied, and very important for research on mammalian evolution and reconstruction of paleoecology and paleoenvironment in Tibetan Plateau and surrounding area.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of paleontological data gathering, 'surface sediment layer collection' refers to the method of obtaining fossil specimens directly from the surface of sedimentary layers in a particular area. This approach involves collecting fossils that are exposed on the surface of the sediment, often due to natural erosion processes, as opposed to those that are buried deeper within the strata.",

                    "Question": "What causes the selection of surface-level fossil collection over deeper excavation methods in the data collection of Cenozoic mammalian fossils in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas?",
                    "Answer": "The selection of surface-level fossil collection over deeper excavation methods is influenced by the accessibility of fossilized remains on the sedimentary strata's surface, which allows for efficient initial collection. Additionally, some specimens might be embedded in shallow layers, making them relatively easier to excavate without extensive digging. This approach can be particularly effective in regions like the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings, where surface deposits may be rich in fossil content. Furthermore, logistical considerations, such as the availability of resources and time constraints, may also play a role in opting for surface-level collection.",

                    "Question": "What are the potential impacts on the understanding of mammalian evolution and ecological restoration in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas when a dataset of newly collected Cenozoic mammal fossil specimens is analyzed?",
                    "Answer": "Analyzing a dataset of newly collected Cenozoic mammal fossil specimens from the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas can significantly enhance the understanding of mammalian evolution and ecological restoration. The dataset provides new, previously unstudied specimens, offering fresh insights into the biological and ecological characteristics of the period. The well-preserved condition of these specimens allows for accurate identification of key features, which is crucial for reconstructing evolutionary timelines and understanding changes in ecological environments over time.",

After collection, the specimens are transported to the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where technicians perform initial cleaning. Subsequently, digital cameras are used to capture image data of the specimens, which are well-preserved and allow for clear assessment of key characteristics of the specimens' individual origins.",
