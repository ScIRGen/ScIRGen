            "description": "Agkistrodon halys is the most widely distributed small poisonous snake in Asia and the largest number in China. The Asian Agkistrodon (Gloydius) belongs to Viper family and Agkistrodon subfamily. It has more than 20 species and is mainly distributed on the edge of Asia and Europe.\nIn this study, two unknown new species of plateau Agkistrodon halys were found and described: Gloydius swild from Heishui County, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan and Gloydius lipipengi from the Nujiang River Basin in Chayu, Tibet.\nThe data are the original paper (PDF version) of the new species of Agkistrodon acutus and Agkistrodon glacialis, including three-dimensional bone reconstruction map, specimen map, habitat map and other original data.\nThe data source is shooting or drawing. The data includes original pictures with high definition. It can be used for further citation and scientific communication.",
