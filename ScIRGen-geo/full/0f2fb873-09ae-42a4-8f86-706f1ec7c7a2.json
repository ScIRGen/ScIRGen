Incident and reflected radiation of canopy, and land surface in reed, saline grass, alfalfa, cumin and barley were measured and diurnal changes of PAR and Fpar were also acquired. Observations were carried out:\n    In plot E (barley) and cumin field on Jun. 6, 2008; plot D (alfalfa) and plot E on Jun. 11; plot D and E on Jun. 15; plot E on Jun. 16; plot A (reed) on Jun. 20; plot B (saline) on Jun. 22; plot D and E on Jun. 23; plot B (saline) on Jun. 24; plot A and plot E on Jun. 29.\n    14 Excel files, one Word and one .TXT were archived.

Measurements are taken at specified sample plots on different dates, and the data collected includes the continuous diurnal variation of PAR and FPAR across these surface types.
