            "description": "This dataset includes Fraction Vegetation Coverage (FVC) data for five countries in Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) during 2010, 2015 and 2020. The data is calculated from the MODIS-NDVI data set (product number MOD13A2.006) based on the empirical relationship between FVC in arid areas and NDVI. The product has a time resolution of 1 year and a spatial resolution of 1 km. The algorithm selects the best available pixel value based on low cloud, low detection angle and highest NDVI value from all the observation data of the year, and performs conversion.",
            "instructions": "FVC data is stored in GeoTIFF format, named \"centralAsia_FVC_yyyy.tif\", where yyyy represents the year. Each tif file contains single-band raster data, representing the largest FVC data of the year.\nGeoTIFF files can be read and opened with ArcGIS software and GDAL.",

In the context of vegetation cover datasets, it is derived from MODIS-NDVI data using an empirical relationship between vegetation cover and NDVI, providing insights into vegetation distribution over time and space, specifically for the years 2010, 2015, and 2020 in five Central Asian countries.",

It selects optimal pixel values using criteria such as low cloud cover and high NDVI. This approach offers annual temporal resolution and 1 km spatial resolution, which may differ in accuracy and applicability when compared to other methods like field surveys or higher resolution satellite data.",
