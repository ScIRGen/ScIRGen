            "description": "The dataset Global Land Water Storage Dynamics Inversion Product Based on Gravity Satellites (2002-2022), abbreviated as HHU-IPM-GRACE, encompasses monthly grids of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA). These grids are derived using the Improved Point Mass (IPM) solution developed at Hohai University (HHU). The TWSA values within this dataset are obtained from the historical and ongoing Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE/GRACE-FO) mission, which employs measurements of the Earth's time-varying gravity field. Curated by Vagner Ferreira at Hohai University in China, the HHU-IPM-GRACE dataset furnishes TWSA values in units of millimeters of equivalent water height. This dataset covers the reference period from April 2002 to May 2022, providing valuable information regarding anomalies relative to the period spanning from January 2004 to December 2009. In summary, the HHU-IPM-GRACE dataset presents a remarkable opportunity for researchers and analysts to conduct in-depth studies on water storage anomalies and their dynamic transformations over time. It serves as an essential resource for exploring hydrological processes, assessing the availability of water, and monitoring global shifts in Earth's water resources.",
            "instructions": "The dataset, known as the \"Global Land Water Storage Dynamics Inversion Product Based on Gravity Satellites (2002-2022),\" provides comprehensive monthly grids of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA). These data are stored in a NetCDF file format, organized spatially with a resolution of 0.25 degrees by 0.25 degrees. It is worth noting that this resolution aligns with the native resolution of GRACE, a satellite mission with a spatial coverage ranging between 300 and 400 kilometers.\nThe NetCDF file, named 'HHU_IPM_GRACE_TWS_200204_202205_v04.nc', contains multiple variables, crucial for analyzing the dataset. These variables include latitude ('lat'), longitude ('lon'), terrestrial water storage ('tws'), and time. Latitude and longitude are represented as decimal arc-degrees and are presented as 720-by-1 and 1440-by-1 vectors, respectively. These values indicate the geographic coordinates of the grid cells' centers, with latitude referring to the north direction and longitude referring to the east direction.\nThe 'tws' variable, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional matrix with dimensions 1440-by-720-by-209. In this matrix, the rows correspond to longitudes, the columns correspond to latitudes, and the pages represent different epochs, accounting for 209 monthly solutions. Finally, the 'time' variable is a 209-by-1 vector, indicating the number of days since January 1, 2002, for each epoch.\nThis dataset provides a valuable resource for conducting detailed analyses of global land water storage dynamics, leveraging gravity satellite measurements. The use of NetCDF format ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, while the high-resolution grid enables accurate investigations into regional and global hydrological processes.",

GRACE monthly solutions of the time-varying Earth’s gravity field are usually expressed in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients called Level-2 data. The Level-2 products are freely distributed by the centers identified in the GRACE Science Data System (SDS).
