            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace geochemical data of porphyry Cu Mo and porphyry Mo deposits in Northeast China, the major and trace Nd isotopic data of accessory minerals apatite and in situ Hf isotopic data of zircon and in situ Hf isotopic data. The samples were collected from the ore-forming rocks of Yanshanian porphyry Cu Mo and Mo deposits in Northeast China. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of minerals are obtained by electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In situ SR nd Hf isotopic geochemical data of minerals were obtained by multi receiver laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. According to the geochemical characteristics of apatite and zircon, the difference of metallogenic magma between Yanshanian porphyry Cu Mo deposit and porphyry Mo deposit in Northeast China is limited. The formation of porphyry Cu Mo deposit is controlled by CL rich fluid formed by dehydration of shallow subducted slab, which is directly related to slab subduction; Porphyry Mo deposits are mainly controlled by F-rich fluids formed by dehydration of water bearing minerals in the lower crust, and are affected by the long-distance effect of subduction plate.",

In contrast, electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry are used to analyze mineral major and trace geochemical data. Both approaches provide complementary information for understanding the geochemical characteristics of porphyry Cu-Mo and Mo deposits, with the former focusing on bulk rock composition and the latter on mineral-specific data.",

The differences in the fluid compositions that control the formation of porphyry Cu-Mo and Mo deposits, such as Cl-rich fluids directly related to shallow slab dehydration for Cu-Mo deposits versus F-rich fluids from deeper slab dehydration effects for Mo deposits, contribute to these discrepancies.",

                    "Answer": "The instrumental techniques used include X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for whole-rock major and trace geochemical data analysis. Electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry are utilized for obtaining mineral major and trace geochemical data. Multi-collector laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is employed for in situ Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic geochemistry data collection. These techniques help in characterizing the geochemical features of apatite and zircon, which are crucial for distinguishing the magmatic nature differences between porphyry copper-molybdenum deposits and porphyry molybdenum deposits in the Yanshanian period. The porphyry Cu-Mo deposits are associated with Cl-rich fluids generated by shallow slab dehydration directly related to subduction, while porphyry Mo deposits are influenced by F-rich fluids from deep crustal hydrous mineral dehydration, affected by the distal effects of subduction.",
