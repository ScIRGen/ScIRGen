            "description": "As a key indicator of global warming, near surface air temperature (Ta) plays a key role in the process of glacier melting. A large number of glaciers are distributed in the Tibetan Plateau（the TP）. However, due to the difficulties of observation caused by high cold and hypoxia, the Ta data in the glacial region of the TP are still scarce, and the existing data have problems such as low accuracy and short time series. This data integrates the  Ta observation data and a variety of MODIS remote sensing products. At the same time, the sunrise and sunset time, the cosine of the solar height and the atmospheric pressure of the station are calculated as auxiliary estimation data. The monthly average temperature of the TP from 2002 to 2020 is estimated by using the random forest model. According to the estimation results, the monthly average Ta of the glacial region of the TP from 1961 to 2020 is reconstructed based on the Bayesian ridge regression principle. The RMSE of the final data in the glacier area is 1.31 ℃. By comparison, the accuracy of this product in plateau glacier area is much higher than that of other similar products. Based on this product, we can analyze the Ta change trend in the TP glacier area in recent decades, and further discuss the impact of climate change on the TP glacier.",
