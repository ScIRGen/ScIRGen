            "description": "This data includes main and micro geochemical data of the whole rock, 40Ar / 39Ar dating data of phlogopite, and Sr-Nd isotope data of the whole rock. The samples were collected from the edge of the Ramba dome in eastern Tibet. The argon isotope of phlogopite uses the stage heating method, and the plateau age and isochron age are calculated by ArArCALC software; The major elements in the whole rock were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF); Trace elements in the whole rock were measured by Quadrupole Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICPMS); Sr-Nd isotopic composition was obtained by MC-ICP-MS. The data obtained show that the age of the phlogopite plateau is 13.1 ± 0.18 Ma, which is consistent with the inverse isochron age; The ultrapotassic melt comes from the partial melting of lithospheric mantle in the Indian continent, and the source depth is shallow, so it should be a spinel stable area.",
            "instructions": "The data is stored in Excel format. The document name is \"PhlAge\", which represents the age of phlogopite; \"WRMajTra\", represents major and trace elements of the whole rock; \"WRIso\" stands for whole-rock isotope.",

                    "Answer": "Using the Ar-Ar dating method alongside Sr-Nd isotopic data and geochemical analyses can enhance the reliability and precision of geological age determination. The integration of these methods allows for cross-verification of results, ensuring consistency in age determination. For example, the consistency in the Ar-Ar plateau age and the inverse isochron age provides confidence in the dating results. Additionally, the complementary geochemical data help to contextualize the age within the broader geological setting, offering insights into the source and history of the rocks.",

                    "Answer": "ArArCALC software is used after conducting Ar-Ar dating through stepwise heating methods on biotite samples. The software processes the raw data to calculate both plateau ages and isochron ages, ensuring that results are consistent and reliable. This involves inputting the measured isotopic ratios from the heating steps, applying corrections for interfering isotopes, and performing statistical analysis to identify the plateau portion of the age spectrum and construct an isochron using the isotope ratios.",
