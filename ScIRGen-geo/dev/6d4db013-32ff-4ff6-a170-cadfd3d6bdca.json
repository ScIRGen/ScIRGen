The Zn block obtained at the University of science and technology of China is located at 31 N latitude ° 5 ', 117 e °。 Zn isotope data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation. After the sample was digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin, MC-ICPMS was used to test the zinc isotope, and international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. The obtained Zn isotopic data can be used as a new international interpolation standard for the establishment of ZB isotopic analysis method by international peers in the future, and provide important significance for the comparison of data between laboratories",

                "Zinc isotopes have been increasingly applied in cosmochemistry, geochemistry, and environmental sciences. The JMC 3-0749L Zn solution is the international primary standard for Zn isotopes, but it is nearly exhausted and no longer available. Zinc exists in aerosol, hydrosphere, biosphere, and the silicate Earth in the form of bivalent cation: Zn2+. The behaviors and cycling of Zn are closely related to various geological processes. Zinc is moderately incompatible during partial melting of mantle and during magma evolution. As an essential nutrient for life, Zn plays an important role in growth, reproduction, immune, and endocrine processes. Zinc isotopes can be fractionated by a number of physical, chemical, and biological processes. The wide application of the Multiple Collector-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) method for high-precision Zn isotopic analyses has been employed for almost two decades. Since then, Zn isotopes have been widely applied in oceanography, cosmochemistry, magmatism, and environmental studies. For example, Zn isotopic composition in the open ocean is significantly higher than that of all known input fluxes, indicating that light Zn isotopes are incorporated into sulphide phases in anoxic settings. Furthermore, Zn isotopes can be used to understand the origin of volatile element depletions during planet accretion because Zn is a moderately volatile element. Clues from major carbonaceous chondrites imply segregation of an isotopically light sulfide phase and loss of the gas phase during chondrule formation. Zn isotope data for continental basalts from eastern China suggest that Zn isotopes have the potential to trace deep carbonate cycling in the Earth's mantle. The combined record of Cd and Zn in the Nuccaleena cap dolostone samples indicates that Zn could also be used to trace biological process cycles after Marinoan snowball Earth glaciation. Finally, zinc isotope signatures in plants tissues reflect differences in pollution sources, which has provided useful information for improving the environmental and human risk assessment."
