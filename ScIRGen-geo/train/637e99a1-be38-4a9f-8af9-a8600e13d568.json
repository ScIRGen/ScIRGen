This data set is the surface anthropogenic heat emission flux data of 500m × 500m spatial resolution in China's land surface area from 2000 to 2016 (2000 / 2004 / 2008 / 2012 / 2016). Data sources and processing methods: (1) through the collection of energy consumption data and socio-economic data of provinces and cities in 2000-2016, the annual average AHF of prefecture level cities (prefectures, districts and leagues) is estimated by the inventory method; (2) The AHF estimation model is established based on multi-source remote sensing data, and the grid AHF is obtained; (3) the AHF estimation results of time series are analyzed and tested, and the deviation values are corrected to improve the accuracy of the AHF estimation results. It is of great significance to understand and master the anthropogenic heat emission and its change for understanding the impact of urbanization on climate, environment and society.",

                "Anthropogenic heat (AH) generated by human activities has a major impact on urban and regional climate. Intensive human activities produce large amounts of anthropogenic heat (AH) released into the atmosphere. A large amount of AH emissions will increase the urban heat island effect. The increase of temperature will have a series of effects on surface energy conversion and the atmospheric boundary layer, and further affect local air quality. Anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) refers to the amount of anthropogenic heat emission (AHE) generated per unit time and unit area. Many researchers have carried out studies on the estimation of AHF, which generally includes three types of methods: (1) energy balance equation; (2) building energy modeling; (3) the energy-consumption inventory approach. The energy-consumption inventory approach is employed to estimate AHF based on socio-economic data and various types of energy-consumption data, which takes into account the heat released from industry, building, and transportation."

            "research objective": [
                "Accurately estimating anthropogenic heat is of great significance for studies on urban thermal environment and climate change. In this study, a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) estimation scheme was constructed based on socio-economic data, energy-consumption data, and multi-source remote sensing data using a partition modeling method, which takes into account the regional characteristics of AH emission caused by the differences in regional development levels. It is essential and meaningful to collect the appropriate grid data and comprehensively use the multi-source remote sensing data to construct the AHF estimation model to obtain the gridded AHF data quickly and efficiently, which can better express the spatial difference of AHF inside the municipal administrative divisions."

            "challenges": [
                "The estimation accuracy of the energy balance equation approach is highly dependent on the estimation accuracy of the parameters in the model, including sensible heat, latent heat, and storage heat. Furthermore, an additional issue of the energy balance equation approach is that it relies on flux measurements that are not available for most locations. Since the socio-economic data and energy consumption data are based on administrative division units, the energy-consumption inventory approach can only obtain the mean value of AHF on the spatial scale represented by the statistical data, which cannot show the fine spatial pattern of AHF in the unit. What is more, it is time-consuming and laborious to obtain the complete and detailed socio-economic data and energy-consumption data for large-scale AHF estimations. DMSP/OLS NTL data presented a serious pixel saturation phenomenon in the urban center, which to some extent led to an underestimation of the AHF in the area. However, the characteristics of anthropogenic heat emission may be different due to the differences in regional development levels and climatic conditions. There are some limitations in the same consideration of AHF emission characteristics of all regions in the large-scale AHF estimation."

Next, taking the multi-source remote sensing data as independent variables, such as Suomi-NPP/VIIRS (Suomi national polar-orbiting partnership visible infrared imaging radiometer suite) NTL data which has a larger brightness range and can effectively overcome the pixel saturation phenomenon of DMSP/OLS data and MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data, and the AHF values obtained by the energy-consumption inventory approach as dependent variables, the gridded AHF estimation models are constructed in eight sub-regions respectively. Then, the performance and accuracy of different estimation models are analyzed and compared, and the optimal set of models are determined as the estimation scheme to achieve the AHF estimation in China. Finally, the refined AHF mapping with a resolution of 500 m was realized in China based on the model."

            "findings": [
                "The results show that the spatial distribution of AHF has obvious regional characteristics in China. Compared with the AHF in provinces, the AHF in Shanghai is the highest which reaches 12.56 W·m−2, followed by Tianjin, Beijing, and Jiangsu. The AHF values are 5.92 W·m−2, 3.35 W·m−2, and 3.10 W·m−2, respectively. As can be seen from the mapping results of refined AHF, the high-value AHF aggregation areas are mainly distributed in north China, east China, and south China. The high-value AHF in urban areas is concentrated in 50–200 W·m−2, and maximum AHF in Shenzhen urban center reaches 267 W·m−2. Further, compared with other high resolution AHF products, it can be found that the AHF results in this study have higher spatial heterogeneity, which can better characterize the emission characteristics of AHF in the region. The spatial pattern of the AHF estimation results correspond to the distribution of building density, population, and industry zone. The high-value AHF areas are mainly distributed in airports, railway stations, industry areas, and commercial centers. It can thus be seen that the AHF estimation models constructed by the partition modeling method can well realize the estimation of large-scale AHF and the results can effectively express the detailed spatial distribution of AHF in local areas."

The AHF in prefecture-level city (state, district, league) is quantified by the inventory method according to four categories: industry, transportation, building, and human metabolism. The AHF of prefecture-level city is estimated by the inventory method. On this basis, the grid AHF estimation model is built by establishing the regression relationship between the vegetation adjusted NTL urban index (VANUI) derived from remotely sensed data and the AHF of prefecture-level city to acquire the fine grid AHF with the spatial resolution of 500 m × 500 m. After the preliminary estimation, the deviation value of the time-series AHF results needs to be detected and corrected. Therefore, by comparing the AHF estimation results of adjacent phases, the underestimation areas of each region are extracted. By establishing the fitting function between the normal estimated values of AHF in adjacent phase of each partition as the correction model of the underestimated area, the deviation value of AHF is corrected."
