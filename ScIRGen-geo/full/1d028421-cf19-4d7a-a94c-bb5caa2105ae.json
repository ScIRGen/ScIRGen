            "description": "This data is the distribution data of 1:250000 faults on the northeast edge of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, including the names, distribution positions, and length fields of each fault, stored in vector format. The data is sourced from the 1:2.5 million geological map of Western China and Neighboring Areas published by the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in December 2006. The original geological map was geographically registered in ArcGIS software, then vectorized to obtain the fault dataset. The fault distribution map can express the characteristics of fault distribution in the northeast edge of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, characterize the background of debris flow disaster prone environment in the northeast edge of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, and has important significance for tectonics and the continuous development of research on the regional development characteristics of debris flows. This study can provide data and scientific basis for in-depth research on the influencing factors of debris flow disasters, and also provide relevant information for the study of debris flows in the study area, providing a basis for related disaster prevention and reduction work.",
