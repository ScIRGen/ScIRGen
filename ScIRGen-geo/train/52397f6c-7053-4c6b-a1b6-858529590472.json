            "description": "This data set includes the whole rock major and trace element geochemical data and zircon U-Pb isotope data of the Carboniferous Permian mafic intrusive rocks in Xilinhot area. The major element data of the whole rock are obtained by XRF, the trace element data of the whole rock are obtained by ICP-MS, and the zircon U-Pb isotope data are obtained by la-icp-ms. This set of data has been published in Acta  Geologica Sinica (English Edition), a geoscience SCI journal. Through the analysis of this set of data, the characteristics of magma source area and regional tectonic evolution history can be effectively constrained.",
