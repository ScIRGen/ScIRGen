            "description": "The Qinghai Tibet Plateau is surrounded by regions with high global carbon aerosol emissions, and the surrounding black carbon and brown carbon can be transmitted to the plateau. Light absorbing black carbon and brown carbon have warming effect, and their settlement on the surface of ice and snow will also accelerate the melting of glaciers and snow. At present, there is little research on brown carbon in this area, and the research on the correlation between brown carbon components and optics is in its infancy. Therefore, the study of Atmospheric Black Carbon and brown carbon in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau has important climate and environmental significance. The aerosol optical absorption characteristics of Atmospheric Black Carbon and brown carbon were obtained by observing in different regions of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. It reveals the spatial differences of optical absorption of black carbon, primary Brown carbon and secondary Brown carbon aerosols in different regions of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                "The important light-absorbing components in the atmosphere include mineral dust, black carbon (BC), and brown carbon (BrC). BrC can be divided into primary BrC (BrC pri) and secondary BrC (BrC sec). The emissions of BC and BrCpri are mainly from fossil fuels combustion and biomass burning. BrCsec are predominantly produced through the secondary chemical processes in the atmosphere. BC and BrC affect the climate and the atmospheric environment through heating the atmosphere, darkening the cryosphere surface, and the melting of the glaciers and snow cover, and alteration of the clouds microphysical and optical properties. The previous studies reported that BC is the most efficient atmospheric light absorption component with a weak dependence on wavelength (λ). It is one of the important short-lived climate forcers, which has been considered as the contributor with the globally averaged radiative forcing of 1.2 W m −2 (including direct and indirect effects). BrC strongly absorbs short wavelengths at the solar spectrum of blue and ultraviolet (UV). The contribution of BrC to radiative forcing is ∼25% of the BC contribution on a planetary scale. At present, the scientific understanding of BrC is limited because its chemical components and light properties are complex, while the study of BC has been pursued in many areas. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), surrounded by the Eastern Asia and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, are influenced by either anthropogenic emissions or regional forest fires. The effects of BC and BrC aerosol are pronounced in the TP, which can darken the surface and consequently accelerate the melting of snow cover and glaciers."

A seven wavelengths Aethalometer was used to measure the light absorption (model AE33, λ = 370, 470, 520, 590, 660, 880, and 950 nm). The minimum R-squared method (MRS) was used for calculating BrCsec absorption at different wavelengths. The solar absorption contributions of BrCpri and BrCsec relative to those of BC in the northeastern, central, and southwestern TP were obtained by using the reported method. To assess the impact of regional transported BC and BrCpri in the TP, 5-day backward air-mass trajectories corresponding to each sampling date were calculated using the HYSPLIT model."

The relative radiative forcings of BrCsec to those of BC were much higher than BrCpri in the range of ultraviolet (300–400 nm). Major potential source distributions were identified, which included the pollution bands along the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the pollution zone in the northwestern China, and the interior of the TP."
