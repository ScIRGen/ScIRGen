It includes the annual mean data of CDOM and DOC of Qinghai Tibet Plateau lakes in 2017. Method of use: Based on the CDOM data of the measured sample points, the image reflectance information is extracted, the best prediction variable is selected through Pearson correlation analysis, and a multiple stepwise regression CDOM prediction model is constructed to obtain the CDOM results of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau water body. Because CDOM has a good correlation with DOC, DOC prediction results are calculated by CDOM. Adjustment R of the CDOM model of the final Qinghai Tibet Plateau ² Up to 0.81.",

                    "Answer": "The methods using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery involve extracting image reflectance information and constructing a multivariate stepwise regression model based on Pearson correlation analysis with actual sample points for CDOM data. This approach allows for broad spatial coverage and potentially high-resolution data. In comparison, traditional in-situ water sampling techniques are often limited in spatial coverage but can provide highly accurate and direct measurements of CDOM and DOC. The accuracy of the satellite-based model is indicated by an adjusted R² of 0.81 for CDOM prediction, reflecting a strong correlation between the satellite-derived and measured data.",

The adjusted R² value of 0.81 indicates a high level of prediction accuracy for CDOM, which is then used to predict DOC due to their strong correlation.",

                    "Answer": "Using satellite data like Sentinel-2 to predict CDOM and DOC levels can enhance data accuracy and model reliability by leveraging high spatial and spectral resolution imagery, allowing for extensive geographic coverage. The method involves extracting image reflectance information, selecting optimal predictive variables through Pearson correlation analysis, and constructing a multivariate stepwise regression model for CDOM prediction. The strong correlation between CDOM and DOC further aids in calculating DOC prediction results. Such an approach can yield a high adjusted R², as evidenced by the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau CDOM model achieving an adjusted R² of 0.81, indicating a robust predictive capability.",

                    "Answer": "The process begins with the collection of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data, followed by extracting reflectance information from these images at locations with measured CDOM data. A Pearson correlation analysis is then conducted to identify the best predictive variables. These variables are used to construct a multivariable stepwise regression model for predicting CDOM levels. Given the strong correlation between CDOM and DOC, the DOC predictions are subsequently derived from the CDOM calculations. The model's effectiveness is reflected in an adjusted R² value of 0.81 for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau water bodies.",

By employing Pearson correlation analysis to select the best predictive variables and constructing a multiple stepwise regression model, researchers can effectively predict CDOM results. This method is further enhanced by the strong correlation between CDOM and DOC, allowing DOC predictions to be calculated through CDOM data.",
