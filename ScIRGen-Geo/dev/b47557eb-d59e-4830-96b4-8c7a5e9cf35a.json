            "description": "This dataset contains the fluxes and meteorological data of Weishan (Gaoying) flux site of Tsinghua University from May 17, 2005 to September 26, 2006. The site (116.0542° E, 36.6487° N, 30 m above sea level) was built on March 18, 2005 and is located in Xiaozhuang Town, Chiping District, Liaocheng City, Shandong Province. It belongs to Weishan Irrigation District along the lower Yellow River. The local climate is characterized as temperate monsoons, with an average annual temperature of 13.8 ℃, an average annual precipitation of 553mm, most of which occurs between June and October, and an average annual potential evaporation of 1950mm. The soil type is silt loam. For the soil of the top 5 cm, the average saturated soil water content, field capacity and wilting point in volumetric values are 0.43, 0.33 and 0.10 m3m-3, respectively. The height of the flux tower is 10m, and the area within about 1 km radius around the flux tower is largely homogeneous winter wheat-summer maize rotation cropland. The winter wheat is generally sown in mid-October and harvested in early June of the following year, while the summer maize is usually planted directly into the stubbles of wheat at the same location immediately after the harvest of wheat and is harvested in late September to early October. See the file named “Supplementary data_WeishanGaoying20052006.xlsx” for specific sowing, harvesting and irrigation dates.\nThe surface flux data is measured by the eddy covariance system, which is composed of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) and an open-path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (LI-7500, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) with an installation height of 3.7m. The 30-minute net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) data were obtained after the raw 10Hz data were processed by Eddypro software. The preprocessing steps included despiking, double coordinate rotation, 30-min block averaging, time lag compensation, spectral corrections, the Webb-Pearman-Leuning (WPL) density correction, a quality check using the “0-1-2 system”. Then the 30-min data were screened as follows: (1) remove bad quality fluxes with quality flag 2; (2) limit H and LE to - 200 ~ 500 W m-2 and - 200 ~ 800 W m-2, respectively; (3) the data during the precipitation events were excluded. Then, REddyproc software is used to filter the data under low turbulence mixing conditions (i.e. filter the flux data according to the friction wind speed u*), fill the gaps in the time series, and then the NEE was divided into ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP) by the nighttime partitioning method.\nThe published dataset includes: year, month, day, time, atmospheric pressure (P), infrared surface temperature (Tsurf), wind speed (Ws), wind direction (Wd), air temperature (Tair) and relative humidity (rH) at 2m, downward short wave radiation (Rsd), upward short wave radiation (Rsu), downward long wave radiation (Rld), upward long wave radiation (Rlu), Net radiation (Rn), incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR_dn), reflected photosynthetically active radiation (PAR_up), precipitation (precip), groundwater level (GW), 5cm/10cm/20cm/40cm/80cm/160cm soil water content (soil_VW_ 5cm / 10cm / 20cm / 40cm / 80cm / 160cm) and soil temperature (soil_T_5cm / 10cm / 20cm / 40cm / 80cm / 160cm), soil heat flux at 5cm depth (soil_ G) , raw data of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE_raw), raw data of latent heat flux (LE_raw), raw data of sensible heat flux (H_raw), net ecosystem carbon exchange after gap filling (NEE_ f) , latent heat flux after gap filling (LE_f), sensible heat flux after gap filling (H_f), ecosystem respiration imputation (Reco_f), gross primary productivity (GPP_f). The data are stored in .xlsx format at 30-minute intervals. Null values in the dataset are represented by NA.\nPlease refer to Lei and Yang (2010a, 2010b) for detailed information of this site and the observation instruments.",

Understanding the seasonal and interannual variability in evapotranspiration and energy partitioning, based on the long-term measurements of fluxes, is important for identifying weather, soil water, and crop factors which regulate fluxes at different temporal scales, and is vital for modeling crop production and water balance. The North China Plain, the largest agricultural production area in China, is a water-limited region. More than 50% of the nation’s wheat and 33% of its maize production is grown on this plain, through a wheat/maize double cropping system. However, the area is experiencing serious water shortages, primarily due to the high water consumption by the agriculture sector through crop transpiration and soil evaporation. Extensive irrigation not only increases evapotranspiration and reduces runoff, but also decreases sensible heat flux. Evaluation of the basic characteristics of evapotranspiration and energy partitioning in response to irrigation is therefore helpful in identifying the effect of irrigation on regional water and energy balances in the North China Plain. The eddy covariance technique (EC) is generally considered to be a highly suitable method for providing direct and trustworthy flux measurements."

A 10 m-high tower was erected for mounting flux and meteorological instruments. The EC system was placed 3.7 m above the ground. Wind velocity and virtual temperature fluctuations were measured using a three-dimensional (3D) sonic anemometer. The sampling frequency of the EC system was 10 Hz. Hydrometeorological variables were recorded at 10-min intervals on several data loggers. Air temperature and humidity were measured at 1.6, 3.6 and 6.0 m above ground level. Downward and upward solar and longwave radiation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were measured at 3.5 m above ground level. A tipping bucket rain gauge was mounted at 1.5 m above the ground. Wind speed and direction were measured at 10.0 m above ground level. Soil temperature and soil water content were measured at 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, 0.80, and 1.6 m below the ground. Soil heat flux was measured at 0.03 m below the ground. Groundwater level was measured using an automatic water depth sensor installed in a groundwater well close to the tower. The half-hourly latent and sensible heat fluxes were calculated by computing the mean covariance of water and temperature fluctuations with the fluctuating vertical velocity observed by the EC system. The TK2 software package was employed for the quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) of the EC data."
