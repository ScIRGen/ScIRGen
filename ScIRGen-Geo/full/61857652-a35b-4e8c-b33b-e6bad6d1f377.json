      "description": "The data set includes annual mass balance of Naimona’nyi glacier (northern branch) from 2008 to 2018, daily meteorological data at two automatic meteorological stations (AWSs) near the glacier from 2011 to 2018 and monthly air temperature and relative humidity on the glacier from 2018 to 2019.\nIn the end of September or early October for each year , the stake heights and snow-pit features (snow layer density and stratigraphy) are manually measured to derive the annual point mass balance. Then the glacier-wide mass balance was then calculated （Please to see the reference).\nTwo automatic weather stations (AWSs,  Campbell company) were installed near the Naimona’nyi Glacier. AWS1, at 5543 m a. s.l., recorded meteorological variables from October 2011 at half hourly resolution, including air temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), and downward shortwave radiation (W m-2) .  AWS2 was installed at 5950 m a.s.l. in October 2010 at hourly resolution and recorded wind speed (m/s), air pressure (hPa), precipitation (mm).\nData quality: the quality of the original data is better, less missing. Firstly, the abnormal data in the original records are removed, and then the daily values of these parameters are calculated.\nTwo probes (Hobo MX2301) which record air temperature and relative humidity was installed on the glacier at half hour resolution since October 2018.  The observed meteorological data was calculated as monthly values.\nThe data is stored in Excel file.\nIt can be used by researchers for studying the changes in climate, hydrology, glaciers, etc.",

        "Glacier mass changes in the Himalayas are a subject of societal concern due to their impact on many large Asian rivers that are relied upon for sustainable water resources; their effect on hazards in downstream regions such as glacial lake outburst floods; and their effect on the availability of Himalayan paleoclimate records from ice cores. Recent studies show that Himalayan glaciers have experienced rapid thinning and shrinkage and that the rates of observed mass changes are spatially and temporally variable. The drivers for the spatiotemporal variability are not well understood and a variety of factors have been proposed to explain it, including debris cover, glacier-lake interactions, morphological variables, climate variability (patterns in air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation) and the response of individual glaciers to climate variability."

        "In October 2010, 39 monitoring stakes were drilled into the ice, distributed across the entire glacier surface. Despite some stakes being lost or measurements failing, our observation network provided a minimum of 15 point measurements of mass balance for 2013/14. The annual glacier-wide mass balance Ba (m w.e.) is calculated according to:      1 1 , n iii a n ii BSB S (1) where n is the total number of altitude intervals for Naimona'nyi Glacier; Si (m2) is the area for each interval; Bi (m w.e.) is the point mass balance at the middle altitude at each individual interval, which is calculated by the interpolation and extrapolation of the point mass balance at stakes. Two automatic weather stations (AWSs) were installed on a lateral moraine beside Naimona'nyi Glacier. AWS1, at 5,543 m a.s.l., recorded meteorological variables from October 2011 at half hourly resolution, including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and downward shortwave radiation (Sin). AWS2 was installed at 5,950 m a.s.l. in October 2010 and recorded Ta, RH, Sin, WS, and WD at hourly resolution. Precipitation data was obtained from all-weather precipitation gauges (T-200B) equipped with hanging weighing transducers installed close to AWS2 in September 2013. Two air temperature and humidity sensors (T1 and T2) were installed on Naimona'nyi Glacier in October 2018 at 6,075 and 5,984 m a.s.l., respectively, to measure gradients in air temperature and relative humidity. The time series of daily mean Ta, daily mean RH and daily mean Sin from AWS1, and daily mean WS and daily total precipitation from AWS2, were used to drive the EMB model to simulate the glacier mass balance at 40 m altitude intervals."

Monthly air temperature and precipitation from six meteorological stations were used in addition to the above, to discuss the relationship between glacier mass balance and climate factors for different regions on the TP. We also used monthly geopotential height and wind fields at 500 hPa levels, air temperature at 2 m and total precipitation from the fifth generation of reanalysis data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) to assess changes to glacier mass balance in the context of macroscale atmospheric circulation."

        "The average annual mass balance measured for Naimona'nyi Glacier was −0.39 m water equivalent a−1 and point mass balances below 6,070 m above sea level were always negative. Simulations showed that melt during the ablation season dominated the annual mass balance and the interannual variability in the mass balance, and that variability in melt energy was controlled by albedo during the ablation season. The annual mass balance was found to be significantly correlated with annual precipitation during the 2011–2018 period, which is accounted for by the change in ablation-season albedo and melt energy. The average mass balance for glaciers in the western Himalayas were higher during the 2010–2019 period than during the 2000–2009 period, partly because of higher annual precipitation during the 2010–2019 period. Over the last 20 years, the increased precipitation in the cold season was driven by a cyclonic circulation anomaly over the northwestern Indian Peninsula, which may be linked to the strengthened North Atlantic Oscillation, and the increased precipitation in the ablation season was driven by an anomaly in the cyclonic circulation over Central India, which may be related to enhanced deep convection over the Indian subcontinent and the enhanced Atlantic multidecadal oscillation."
