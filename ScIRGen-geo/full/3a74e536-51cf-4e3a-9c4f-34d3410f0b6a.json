            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with PROBA CHRIS was obtained in the Biandukou foci experimental area on Jun. 22, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) quadrates investigation including GPS by GARMIN GPS 76, species by manual cognition, the plant number by manual work, the height by the measuring tape repeated 4-5 times, the chlorophyll content by SPAD 502, the coverage by manual work and the biomass (samples from 0.5m×0.5m) by wet weight and dry weight. Data were archived as Excel files. \n     (2) LAI of maize, desert scrub and the poplar by the fisheye camera (CANON EOS40D with a lens of EF15/28), shooting straight downwards, with exceptions of higher plants, which were shot upwards. Data included original photos (.JPG) and those processed by can_eye5.0 (as Excel files). For more details, see Readme file.\n     (3) ground object spectrum of grassland,  barley and the rape by ASD FieldSpec (350～2 500 nm) from BNU, with 20% reference board. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro), which were recorded daily in detail, and pre-processed data on reflectance were in .txt.\n     (4) BRDF of grassland, barley and the rape by ASD FieldSpec (350～2 500 nm), with 20% reference board. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro), which were recorded daily in detail. The processed reflectance and transmittivity were archived in .txt files.\n     The dataset includes processed spectrum data, soil moisture, BRDF, quadrates investigation, integrating spheres data on the rape, LAI, CHRIS data and the fisheye camera data.",

It involves measuring the reflectance and transmittance of surfaces like grassland, barley, and rapeseed using instruments like the ASD FieldSpec spectrometer. The data is stored as both raw binary files and processed text files, providing information about the directional dependence of surface reflectance.",

The photos are then processed with can_eye5.0 software and stored as JPG files and Excel format results.

The objects observed include maize, desert shrubs, and poplar trees. Most photos are taken from above, but for taller crops, they are taken from below. In cases of strong light, the photos are taken at a 45-degree downward angle.
