            "description": "The multi-angle spectra dataset includes desert vegetation, corn, snow and soil (chernozems). The along-principal plane and the cross-principal plane were selected because the directional reflectance show the strongest and the weakest changes in these two planes. The desert vegetation campaign took place over a Gobi covered by moss crust in Zhangye of Gansu Province on Jul 8th, 2012, and 31 planes were nearly continuously-measured from morning to afternoon by SVC HR-1024. The number of angles per plane ranged between 9 and 16. In this way, abundant solar illumination angles were collected except for the viewing angular variation. The datasets of maize were collected in Wuxing village of Zhangye on June 29, 2012 with SVC HR-1024. A total of 7 planes were measured with 14 angles per plane. The datasets of snow were measured in Aletai of Xingjiang province on March 23 and March 24, 2016 with 3 planes and 4 planes, respectively, by ASD. For each plane, there were 42 angles of measurements. The bare soils with different roughness and moisture in Changchun City of Jilin Province were measured on Oct. 30th, 2017 with 12 planes by PSR-3500. For each plane, the number of observation angles ranged between 28 and 29. The spectral of each specific target (each angle) is averaged of several times of repeat reflectance observations. In order to collect smooth and continuous spectral curves, the least squares polynomial fitting algorithm is applied to remove the abnormal fluctuations in the vapor absorption channel, and the spectral curves are interpolated to 1 nm spectral resolution using piecewise linear interpolation functions. This dataset aids particularly the development of the modeling of plant growth and vegetation phenology, can also support further research on cross-scale ecological processes and underlying mechanisms. It also makes a difference to the quantification of the geometric effects of solar and sensor in the physical radiative transfer processes, and the retrieval of surface biophysical and biochemical parameters. Moreover, these in situ measurements can also been taken as reference truth for satellite spectra observations validation.",
            "instructions": "The multiangle measurements in each plane were organized in a folder named as “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS”, and there are 57 folders in total. The “AAAA” was set as “BRDF”. The “BBBB_CCCC” means the land cover and the object name. The “YYYYMMDDHHMMSS” shows the measured time. The spectra data in different angles and their metadata file were processed as TXT format and XML format, respectively. The file of the measured reflectance spectra in a specific angle was named as “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_XXXX”. The naming scheme of “AAAA_BBBB_CCCC_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS” is the same as the folder. While the “XXXX” present the measurement angles. For instance, “A001” and “A015” refer to the measurement in the first and the fifteenth angles, respectively.  The “AAAA” of the metadata files were set as “comp” and “chrp”. The former saves the general information of the multiangle measurements while the latter record the special scene information of the spectra.",

                    "Answer": "多角度光谱数据集 refers to a dataset that includes multi-angular spectral measurements of different land surface types such as desert vegetation, corn, snow, and soil. The data is collected across various angles in parallel and perpendicular principal planes to observe the directional reflectance properties. This involves repeated measurements at specific angles, which are then averaged to produce smooth spectral curves, and further processed to remove atmospheric interferences and interpolate the spectra to a 1nm resolution. Such datasets are crucial for modeling plant growth, studying vegetation phenology, and analyzing the effects of observation geometries on surface radiation processes.",

                    "Answer": "Using a multi-angle reflectance measurement approach enhances the understanding of surface radiation transfer processes by allowing for a more detailed analysis of how different land cover types reflect light at various angles. This can lead to improved modeling of plant growth and vegetation phenology, support the study of cross-scale ecological processes, and provide insights into the intrinsic mechanisms of radiative transfer. It also aids in quantifying the impact of incident observation geometry on these processes and can be used for the inversion of physiological and chemical parameters, as well as serving as a relative 'true value' for validation purposes.",

Measurements are taken at various angles within these planes: for desert vegetation, angles range from 9 to 16 across 31 planes; for corn, 7 planes with 14 angles each; for snow, measurements occur over 3 to 4 planes with 42 angles each; and for bare soil, 12 planes with 28 to 29 angles each. To ensure accuracy, the spectral data for each specific angle is averaged from repeated observations. Abnormal fluctuations due to atmospheric water vapor are removed using a least squares polynomial fitting algorithm. Segmented linear interpolation functions are then applied to interpolate the spectral curve to a 1nm spectral resolution.",
