            "description": "The Administrative boundary dataset is the base in the global change research, and it is important for the whole project.At present, DIVA-GIS is the basic source of administrative boundary. Whole national administrative boundary shapefiles were downloaded from DIVA-GIS. Based on the official administrative units (municipalities) as the basic units, the administrative units at the higher level (provincial level) where the municipalities are located are stored and reserved as the research objects.If the provincial unit area of the node has exceeded 10,000 square kilometers, the provincial unit will be retained as the research area. At the same time, if the provincial unit area of the node is small, then considering the political and economic impact of the provincial level and its surrounding areas, neighboring provincial units are also combined by merging and retaining to at least 10,000 square kilometers as the research object. Finally, the administrative region data of all 31 key node regions (Abbas, Alexander, Ankara, Astana, Bangkok, Chittagong, Colombo, Dhaka, Djibouti, Ekaterinburg, Gwadar, Hambantota, Karachi, Kolkata, Kuantan, Kyaukpyu, Maldives, Mandalay, Melaka, Minsk, Mumbai, Novosibirsk, Piraeus, Rayong, Sihanouk, Tashkent, Teheran, Valencia, Vientiane, Warsaw, Yangon) are produced. This data set serves as the research basis for all remote sensing data and provides baseline data for the project. This dataset can be updated in real time according to the official or government information of the node.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of global change research, 'administrative boundary' refers to the foundational data that delineates the borders of administrative units, such as cities and provinces. This data serves as a critical base for research projects, providing essential geographical boundaries that facilitate the study of various aspects of global change. Administrative boundaries are particularly important for defining research areas and are typically sourced from reliable databases like DIVA-GIS.",

                    "Answer": "The requirement for maintaining at least a 10,000 square kilometer area is due to the need to encompass political and economic influences from surrounding regions, ensuring comprehensive coverage and relevance in the study. This criterion helps in combining smaller provincial units with their neighboring areas to form a significant region for research purposes.",

                    "Answer": "The objectives include providing foundational data for global change research by defining administrative boundaries as essential baseline data. This dataset aims to support research projects by offering a standardized and detailed representation of administrative units at both the city and provincial levels. The dataset enables exploration of political and economic influences within and around the key nodes, ensuring that research covers areas that are strategically significant and sufficiently large. Furthermore, it facilitates the integration of remote sensing data, serving as a critical layer for spatial analysis and ensuring that research can adapt to real-time updates based on official or local government information.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures involve downloading base data from DIVA-GIS and using official administrative units (cities) as the basic units of study. For areas where the provincial unit exceeds 10,000 square kilometers, that unit is maintained as the research area. For smaller provincial units, the procedure considers the political and economic influence of the province and neighboring areas, merging them to retain at least 10,000 square kilometers. These steps ensure a comprehensive administrative boundary dataset for the 31 key node areas.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of administrative boundary data from DIVA-GIS with other geospatial datasets is enabled by downloading base data from DIVA-GIS for specific key node regions within the Pan-Third Pole area. This involves using official administrative units at the city level, while also considering provincial units if they exceed certain size thresholds or combine smaller units based on political and economic influences to ensure a comprehensive research area of at least 10,000 square kilometers for each key node. The dataset serves as foundational data for all remote sensing research and can be updated in real-time according to official or government information.",
