            "description": "The data comes from the China Urban and Rural Elderly Population Sampling Survey (SSAPUR) conducted in 2015, which is a cross-sectional study involving a national representative sample of the elderly aged 60 and above from 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government in Chinese Mainland. Subjects with diabetes were included in the study. The frailty index (FI) is based on 33 latent defects and is used to classify individuals into three categories: robust, pre frail, or frail. The data survey was conducted from August 1, 2015 to August 31, 2015. The sampling is divided into four stages. The first stage is to allocate the sample size based on the proportion of the elderly population in each province/city/autonomous region in the country. Using 2853 districts (counties) from 31 provinces (cities, autonomous regions) in mainland China as the basic sampling unit, 466 districts (counties) were selected for questionnaire survey. In the second stage, using the total number of elderly people in each district (county) as auxiliary information, four townships (streets) were selected from each district (county) using the PPS sampling method. Stage 3: Using the total number of elderly people in each township (street) as auxiliary data, four village (neighborhood) committees were selected from each township (street) using the PPS sampling method. Stage 4: In the selected townships (streets), based on the list of elderly people reported before the survey, an equidistant sampling method is adopted to select 30 elderly people. The design sample size for this survey is 223680 people, with a sampling rate of approximately 1 in 1000. The actual number of samples collected is 224142 people.",

                "Diabetes is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases among the older adults worldwide. The 2017 China Diabetes Prevalence Survey showed that the prevalence of diabetes in the older adults aged ≥ 60 years was 30.0%, and China has the largest number of older adults with diabetes in the world. Various acute and chronic complications caused by diabetes seriously affect the health status and quality of life of the older adults. Frailty, an emerging global health burden, is a common geriatric syndrome. A meta-analysis of 21 studies from Western high-income countries showed the prevalence of frailty among community-dwelling older adults ranges from 4 to 59%, with an average prevalence of 11%, the pooled prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty among community-dwelling older adults in China were 10 and 43%, respectively, leading to an increased risk of falls, disability, hospitalization, and death, as well as an independent predictor of higher healthcare expenditure among older adults. As populations age, diabetes and frailty are frequently co-occurring health outcomes, and both frailty and diabetes increase the risk of adverse outcomes in older adults. A meta-analysis showed that older adults with diabetes with frailty had significantly increased risks of hospitalization, disability, and death compared with older adults with diabetes who were not frail. Studies have shown that frailty was an important factor affecting the target level of blood glucose management in the older adults with diabetes. The International Position Statement on Frailty in Diabetes emphasized that the identification and assessment of frailty should be part of the routine management of people with diabetes. Compared with developed countries, the research on frailty in the older adults in China started relatively recently, there were few comprehensive studies on the prevalence and associated factors of frailty and pre-frailty among older adults with diabetes nationwide."

The prevalence of frailty in the older adults with diabetes was 22.4%, which was higher than that in the older adults without diabetes (8.2%; χ 2 = 3,884.9, P < 0.001). The prevalence of pre-frailty in the older adults with diabetes was 58.5%, which was higher than that in the older adults without diabetes (44.6%; χ2 = 1,284.3, P < 0.001). Our study also found that female, rural residency, illiterate, ethnic minority, widowed, living alone, financial difficulties, and very difficult medical reimbursement were associated with the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in older adults with diabetes. Our study found significant regional differences in the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in older adults with diabetes. The prevalence of frailty in older adults with diabetes in northern China was higher than that in southern China."

                    "Answer": "The categorization is based on a frailty index (FI) derived from 33 potential deficits. The sampling is conducted in four stages using a cross-sectional approach, with proportional allocation of samples based on the older population in each province, and PPS sampling methods at district, town, and village levels.",

These challenges could impact the findings by potentially skewing the prevalence rates and not fully capturing the dynamic nature of frailty development over time.",

The sampling process was conducted in four stages, with the use of PPS sampling methods and equidistant sampling techniques. While this method provides a comprehensive representation, future improvements could include ensuring the verification of self-reported diabetes status to reduce memory bias and incorporating longitudinal data to assess causal relationships between diabetes and frailty.",
