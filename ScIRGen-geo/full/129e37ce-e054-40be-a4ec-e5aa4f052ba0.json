            "description": "The data set consists of 93 continuous and mobile GPS stations recording the cumulative three-dimensional deformation variables 10 years after the 2008 mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. GPS daily sampling time series data are mainly from the website of China Seismological Bureau（ http://www.cgps.ac.cn/ ）Diao, F., Wang, R., Wang, Y., Xiong, X., Walter, T.R. (2018), fault behavior and lower critical physiology informed from the first seven years of postseismic GPS data after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, earth planet. SCI. Lett., 495, 202-212, DOI: 10.1016/j.epsl.2018.05.020. We process the post earthquake deformation data as follows: first, we correct other effects unrelated to the Wenchuan earthquake, such as seasonal variation, interannual variation, plate effect, etc; Thirdly, the post earthquake time series curve is fitted by exponential function and logarithmic function; Finally, the post earthquake deformation of any period is calculated by fitting the curve. Ten years after the earthquake, the accumulated deformation is nearly 21 cm. The horizontal accuracy is not less than 1.7 cm, and the vertical accuracy is not less than 4 cm.",

                    "Answer": "Postseismic deformation data refers to the measurements of ground movement recorded after an earthquake event, specifically the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in this context. The data includes cumulative three-dimensional deformation over a ten-year period as recorded by GPS stations. These measurements are processed to correct for unrelated influences such as seasonal and interannual variations, as well as plate tectonic effects, and are fitted using exponential and logarithmic functions to calculate deformation over any given time period.",

                    "Answer": "In the field mentioned, the correction process involves removing unrelated influences such as seasonal and interannual variations and plate effects from the GPS time series data. This is done to ensure the accuracy of the postseismic deformation measurements following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The accuracy achieved in the horizontal direction is not less than 1.7 centimeters, and in the vertical direction, not less than 4 centimeters. This process is specifically designed to enhance the reliability of the deformation data over a 10-year period. In comparison, other geophysical datasets may use different correction methodologies, potentially involving more sophisticated modeling or additional data sources, to handle similar challenges and ensure data accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "From the analysis of GPS data recorded over a decade, one can infer the cumulative three-dimensional deformation patterns and tectonic activity resulting from the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. Seasonal and interannual variations, along with plate effects, need to be corrected to accurately interpret the postseismic deformation patterns. The processed data reveals significant deformation, with accumulated displacements reaching up to 21 centimeters within ten years, and the precision in horizontal and vertical directions is 1.7 centimeters and 4 centimeters, respectively. These corrections and analyses can help understand fault behavior and lower crustal rheology in response to such seismic events.",

The corrected data is then fitted using exponential and logarithmic functions to model the post-seismic time series curve, allowing for the calculation of deformation over any given period.",
