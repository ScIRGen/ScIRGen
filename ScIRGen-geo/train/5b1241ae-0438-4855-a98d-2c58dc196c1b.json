For detailed description of experimental design, please refer to the original paper.\n\nModel details: COSMOS (ECHAM5-JSBACH-MPI-OM), a comprehensive fully coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM), is used to generate the dataset. The atmospheric model ECHAM5, complemented by the land surface component JSBACH, is used at T31 resolution (∼3.75°), with 19 vertical layers. The ocean model MPI-OM, including sea-ice dynamics that is formulated using viscous-plastic rheology, has a resolution of GR30 (3°×1.8°) in the horizontal, with 40 uneven vertical layers.",
