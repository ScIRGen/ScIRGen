The ground is flat, with open surrounding terrain. An uneven growth of alpine steppe, with a height of 3–20 cm. The observation time of this dataset is from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. The observation elements primarily included the wind speed, air temperature, air relative humidity, air pressure, downward shortwave radiation, precipitation, evaporation, latent heat flux and CO2 flux. The precipitation , evaporation and CO2 flux data are daily cumulative values, and the other variables are daily average values. The observed data are generally continuous, but some data are missing due to power supply failure, and the missing data in this dataset are marked as NAN.",

                    "Answer": "In high-altitude, cold climate environments like the Naqu observation station, data collection procedures involve setting up an observation field that is flat and open, with sparse vegetation ranging from 3-20 cm in height. Key meteorological elements such as wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, downward shortwave radiation, precipitation, evaporation, latent heat flux, and CO2 flux are observed. Daily cumulative values are recorded for precipitation, evaporation, and CO2 flux, while other elements are averaged daily. Challenges such as data continuity may arise due to power supply failures, and missing values are marked as NAN. Ensuring reliable power supply and employing robust data recording systems are crucial procedures to address these challenges.",
