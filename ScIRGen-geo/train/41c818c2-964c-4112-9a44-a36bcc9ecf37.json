Samples were collected from dacites and rhyolites from Baingoin in central Tibet. Zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data were analyzed on LA-IC-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS, respectively. Whole-rock major and trace elemental analyses were performed on XRF and ICP-MS, respectively. The data has very good quality. These data are able to constrain the age, genesis, and tectonic settings of post-collisional Late Cretaceous magmatism from northern Lhasa subterrane.",

                    "Answer": "Zircon U-Pb age data is obtained through laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which involves using a focused laser beam to ablate a small area of a zircon crystal. The ablated material is then carried by a carrier gas into the inductively coupled plasma, where it is ionized. The ions are then analyzed by the mass spectrometer to determine the isotopic composition, allowing for the calculation of the U-Pb age of the zircon.",

By analyzing these data, researchers can infer the tectonic evolution and magmatic processes that occurred during the post-collisional Late Cretaceous period in central Tibet.",

This approach allows researchers to accurately determine the age, origin, and formation background of magmatic activities in the specified region, contributing to a deeper understanding of the post-collisional magmatism of the Late Cretaceous period in the northern Lhasa Terrane.",
