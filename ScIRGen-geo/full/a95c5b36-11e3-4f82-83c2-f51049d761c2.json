The seismotectonic map of Western Asia covers Iran and its surrounding countries and regions. Based on the “Major active faults of Iran” map, the seismotectonic map is replenished with massive published data and depicts the location and nature of the seisogenic faults or active faults and the epicenter of earthquakes with M ≥ 5 from 1960 to 2019.  The map can not only be used in the research of active faults and seismic risks in Western Asia, but also will be applied to the seismic safety evaluation for infrastructure construction.",
