            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas on Jun. 29, 2008. WiDAS, composed of four CCD cameras, one mid-infrared thermal imager (AGEMA 550), and one infrared thermal imager (S60), can acquire VNIR, MIR and TIR band data. The simultaneous ground data included:\n     (1) Atmospheric parameters in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot from CE318 (produced by CIMEL in France). The total optical depth, aerosol optical depth, Rayleigh scattering coefficient, column water vapor in 936 nm, particle size spectrum and phase function were then retrieved from these observations. The optical depth in 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm and 440nm were all acquired by CE318. Those data include the raw data in .k7 format and can be opened by ASTPWin. ReadMe.txt is attached for detail. Processed data in Excel format are on optical depth, rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. \n     (2) Emissivity of maize and wheat in the Yingke oasis by portable 102F (2.0~25.0um) from BNU. Warm blackbody, cold blackbody, the target and the au-plating board of known emissivity. Raw data of those four measurements were archived in *.WBX, *.CBX, *.SAX and *.CBX  Besides, the spectral radiance and emissivity calculated by 102F were archived in *.RAX and *.EMX, respectively. Meanwhile, the final spectral emissivity of targets were also calculated by TES (ISSTES).\n     (3) LAI of mazie and wheat in Yingke oasis maize field. The maximum leaf length and width of leaves were measured. Data were archived as Excel files of Jul. 2. \n     (4) FPAR (Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation) of maize and wheat by SUNSACN and the digital camera in Yingke oasis maize field. FPAR= (canopyPAR－surface transmissionPAR－canopy reflection PAR+surface reflectionPAR) /canopy PAR; APAR=FPAR* canopy PAR. Data were archived in MS Office Word format.\n     (5) the radiative temperature by the automatic thermometer (FOV: 10°; emissivity: 0.95), measured at nadir with time intervals of one second in Yingke oasis maize field (one from BNU and the other from Institute of Remote Sensing Applications), Huazhaizi desert maize field (only one from BNU for continuous radiative temperature of the maize canopy) and Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot (two for reaumuria soongorica canopy and the background bare soil). Raw data, blackbody calibrated data and processed data were all archived as Excel files.\n     (6) the component temperature in Yingke oasis maize field (by the handheld radiometer and the thermal image from BNU), Yingke oasis wheat field and Huazhaizi desert maize field. For maize, the component temperature included the vertical canopy temperature, the bare land temperature and the plastic film temperature; for the wheat, it included the vertical canopy temperature, the half height temperature, the lower part temperature and the bare land temperature. The data included raw data (in MS Office Word format), recorded data and the blackbody calibrated data (in Excel format).\n     (7) Maize albedo by the shortwave radiometer in Yingke oasis maize field. R =10H (R for FOV radius; H for the observation height). Data were archived in MS Office Excel format.\n     (8) the radiative temperature by the handheld radiometer in Yingke oasis maize field and Huazhaizi desert maize field (the vertical canopy observation and the transect observation for both fields), and Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot (the NE-SW diagonal observation). The data included raw data (in .doc format), recorded data and the blackbody calibrated data (in Excel format).\n     (9) ground object reflectance spectra in Yingke oasis maize field by ASD FieldSpec (350～2 500 nm) from BNU. The vertical canopy observation and the line-transect observation were used. The data included raw data (from ASD, read by ViewSpecPro), recorded data and processed data on reflectance (in Excel format).",

                    "Answer": "Synchronous ground observation in the context of remote sensing experiments involves collecting ground-based data simultaneously with airborne or satellite data acquisition. This approach enhances the calibration and validation of remote sensing data by providing a direct comparison between the ground truth and the remotely sensed data. It typically includes measurements of parameters such as spectral reflectance, atmospheric conditions, and surface temperatures using various instruments like spectrometers, radiometers, and sun photometers.",

                    "Answer": "Variability in spectral emissivity measurements can arise from factors such as the dynamic calibration process involving warm and cold black bodies, the impact of atmospheric downwelling radiation, and the precision of measured targets like crops. Additionally, the algorithm used by the spectrometer itself may introduce anomalies, which can be mitigated by employing iterative spectral techniques.",

                    "Answer": "The calibration process for measuring spectral emissivity involves using a portable infrared spectrometer (102F) to measure the spectral emissivity of corn and wheat within the specified spectral range of 2.0~25.0um. This includes measuring warm and cold black bodies, the target object, and a gold-plated plate with known emissivity. The black body measurements calibrate the instrument dynamically, while the gold-plated plate measurement eliminates the influence of atmospheric downwelling radiation on the target radiation. The raw data files generated are in *.WBX, *.CBX, *.SAX, and *.CBX formats, which can be read with common software like Notepad. Further processing includes using the instrument's algorithm to derive emissivity values, taking into account potential anomalies, and providing corrected emissivity values using the Iterative Spectral Smoothing and Temperature Emissivity Separation (ISSTES) algorithm. The results are stored in Excel format.",
