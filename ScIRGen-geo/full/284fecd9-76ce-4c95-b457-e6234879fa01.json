Observed objects included snow, sandstone, grass and ice. The data were archived in the ASCII format, with the first five rows as the file header and the following two columns as wavelength (nm) and reflectance (percentage) respectively, and can be opened by .txt or wordpad. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro).",

This data is crucial for understanding the optical properties of these surfaces and is typically formatted in ASCII with a description in the header, followed by columns representing wavelengths and reflectance percentages.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of spectral data collection in environments with varying surface covers can be influenced by several factors, including the presence of snow which can reflect light differently compared to sand, grass, or ice. The condition and thickness of the snow cover, as well as the angle of the sun and the presence of shadows, can also affect reflectance measurements. Additionally, the type of instrument used and the method of calibrating it for different surface types play a crucial role in ensuring accurate data collection.",

                    "Answer": "Using ASCII format for storing spectral data makes it accessible and easy to open with basic text editors like Notepad or WordPad, which enhances usability for researchers who may not have specialized software. However, it may pose challenges in handling large datasets or integrating with other data processing tools that require more structured data formats.",

                    "Answer": "Spectral measurements of typical ground objects like snow, sand, grass, and ice were conducted on a flat terrain covered with approximately 10cm of snow. The data were measured near a road in the Arou intensive observation area. The collected data is in ASCII format, which includes a header describing related information followed by two columns representing wavelength (nm) and reflectance (percent reflectance). The original data files are in ASD-specific format and can be opened using the ASD Viewspec software.",
