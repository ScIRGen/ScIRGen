            "description": "Knowledge the elemental composition of aerosols in remote areas is very important for assessing the impact of human activities. This dataset reports the elemental composition of atmospheric aerosols (TSP) in Ranwu, a remote area in the southeast of the Tibet Plateau, from November 2019 to December 2020. The data include acid soluble and total soluble components. The results of acid soluble components are determined by adding 1% sample volume of nitric acid to react for seven days; The treatment of the total soluble component is to use the mixture of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid for determination after pressurized digestion. The Chinese loess reference material (GBW07408) is used for quality control. In general, the element concentrations in this area are lower than those in other stations in the southeast of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, but slightly higher than those in the interior of the plateau (Nam co). The interior of the Tibet Plateau is the main source of elements from the crust, and the typical heavy metal elements are the long-distance transport of pollutants emitted by human activities in South Asia and Southeast Asia. The data supplement the database of aerosol elements in the southeast of the Tibet Plateau.",

In contrast, urban environments may require different methods that account for higher pollution levels and diverse sources of emissions. The remote area's methods can provide insights into crustal and long-range transported pollutants, whereas urban methods might focus more on local anthropogenic sources.",

This approach can reveal differences in the solubility of elements, which is important for understanding their atmospheric behavior and sources. For instance, acid-soluble components might indicate elements more likely to interact with atmospheric acids, while total dissolution gives a complete picture of all elements present, including those from crustal sources. This comprehensive data collection method can provide insights into the balance between natural and anthropogenic contributions to aerosol composition, particularly in remote regions like the Tibetan Plateau.",

The data can reveal the presence and concentration of crustal elements and heavy metals, which are indicative of pollution from distant human activities in South and Southeast Asia. By comparing these concentrations to other regions, researchers can identify the primary sources of these elements and evaluate the extent of anthropogenic influence.",
