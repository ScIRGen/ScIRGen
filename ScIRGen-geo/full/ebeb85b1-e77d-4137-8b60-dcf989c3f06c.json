            "description": "The data are obtained from pyroxene diorite and monzodiorite in yangchongli gold deposit, Tongling, Anhui Province, by means of fluid inclusion thermometry, laser Raman analysis and h, O isotope measurement. The micro thermometric data of fluid inclusions were measured by Linkam thmsg 600, the laser Raman data were analyzed by LabRAM HR evolution confocal laser Raman spectrometer, the H isotope data were analyzed by thermo Finnigan isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and the O isotope data were analyzed by Finnigan mat252 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the obtained data, we can obtain the property and source of ore-forming fluid, and the metallogenic mechanism and metallogenic model of yangchongli gold deposit.",
