            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Zhangye-Yingke-Huazhaizi flight zone on Jul. 7, 2008.\n     Intra-band data available for general users include Level-2C data (after geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections), Level-1B browse image (after intra-band matching) and Level-2B browse image (after registration). The raw data, Level-1A, and data processing parameters were filed; applications would be evaluated prior to access. Data processing started in Aug. 2008 and ended in Apr. 2009, and in Nov. 2009, CCD data were reprocessed to adjust radiometric calibration. \n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id\n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 3#15 || 1500m || 11:00:55 || 11:09:55  ||133 || processed; complete || good\t\n|-\n| 2 || 3#13 || 1500m || 11:14:40 || 11:23:45  || 136 || processed; complete || good\n|-\n| 3 || 3#11 || 1500m || 11:27:35 || 11:36:45  || 137 || processed; complete || good || the resort, Yingke weather station maize field and Yingke wheat field\n|-\n| 4 || 3#9 || 1500m || 11:40:55 || 11:50:20 || 137 || incomplete || incomplete || the wetland park, Zhangye city,Yingke weather station maize field, Yingke wheat field and Huazhaizi desert maize field\n|-\n| 5 || 3#9a || 1500m || 11:53:25 || 12:02:40  || 142 || processed; complete || good || the wetland park, Zhangye city,Yingke weather station maize field, Yingke wheat field and Huazhaizi desert maize field\n|-\n| 6 || 3#7 || 1500m || 12:07:10 || 12:16:35 || 119 || processed; complete || good\n|-   \n| 7 || 3#5 || 1500m || 12:19:05 || 12:28:15 || 137 || processed; complete || good || Huazhaizi desert plot 1\n|- \n| 8 || 3#3 || 1500m || 12:32:35 || 12:41:50 || 115 || processed; complete || good || Huazhaizi desert plot 2\n|- \n| 9 || 3#1 || 1500m || 12:45:25 || 12:54:40 || 139 || processed; complete || good \n|-   \n| 10 || 3#z1 || 1500m || 13:03:55 || 13:08:00  || 61 || processed; complete || good \n|-   \n| 11 || 3#z2 || 1500m || 13:10:50 || 13:14:45  || 59 || processed; complete\n|}",

In the dataset, the original data underwent geometric correction, radiation calibration, and atmospheric correction to ensure accuracy and usability. For example, the CCD camera's radiation calibration was corrected in November 2009 to improve data quality. Additionally, incomplete data acquisition, as seen in flight line '3#9', required a reflight ('3#9a') to achieve a complete dataset. Such corrections and calibrations are critical for maintaining data quality and completeness, especially when original data are incomplete or have missing bands.",

This results in more reliable Level-2C products, which are crucial for end-user applications. Additionally, it allows for the correction of initial data inaccuracies, as evidenced by the correction done in November 2009 for CCD camera calibration.",

The original data undergoes these processing steps to ensure accuracy and usability for general users. Challenges that might arise during this data processing include handling incomplete original data, such as in the case of flight line '3#9', which required a re-flight ('3#9a') due to incomplete data acquisition.
