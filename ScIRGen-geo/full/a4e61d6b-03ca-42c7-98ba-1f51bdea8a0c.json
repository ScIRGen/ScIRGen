Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

The sensors are mounted on a 4-meter high frame and are connected to a Campell CR1000 data logger for automatic recording. Calibration is initially set with default surface emissivity values from the factory, and no blackbody calibration was performed during the experimental period.",
