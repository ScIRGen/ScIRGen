            "description": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS elemental geochemical analysis and tims Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition show that the basic dyke swarms in Wudang area of South Qinling have two different emplacement ages, ~ 460 Ma and ~ 220 Ma, which are far less than the previous results of ~ 680-650 ma. The two basic dikes show similar major element characteristics, but different trace element and isotopic characteristics. The early Paleozoic magmas are enriched in LREEs, Liles and HFSEs, and have emii type mantle isotopic characteristics, indicating that they came from OIB like enriched mantle sources. The early Mesozoic mafic dikes can be divided into two types, one is depleted in LREEs, Liles and HFSEs, and has DM type mantle isotopic characteristics, indicating that they came from the asthenosphere mantle source area. The second type has higher Rb, Ba, K contents than the first type dikes, and has EMI type isotopic characteristics, indicating that their source area contains significant contribution from the lower crust of the Yangtze plate. The data comes from the scientific research project \"deep process and resource effect of major geological events in Yanshanian period\" (2016YFC0600404), a national key research and development plan.",

It involves the use of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to measure isotopic ratios and trace element concentrations, providing insights into the timing of magmatic events and the source characteristics of the magma.",

                    "Answer": "Zircon dating using LA-ICP-MS is focused on determining the age of rock formations by analyzing zircon crystals, providing precise timing for magmatic events. Geochemical analysis using XRF and ICP-MS focuses on the elemental composition of rocks, offering insights into the chemical characteristics and sources of magmatic intrusions. While zircon dating provides chronological context, geochemical analysis offers a detailed view of the elemental and isotopic composition, which can distinguish between different sources of magma and their evolution. Both methods are complementary; zircon dating is essential for establishing a timeline, whereas geochemical analysis provides the necessary context for interpreting the processes involved.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in zircon age dating and geochemical composition data collection methods for mafic dikes in different geological periods can be attributed to differences in the elemental and isotopic characteristics of the source mantle regions. During the Early Paleozoic, the mafic dikes show enriched LREEs, LILEs, and HFSEs with EMII-type mantle isotopic characteristics, suggesting a source from an enriched mantle similar to OIB. In contrast, the Early Mesozoic mafic dikes exhibit two types: one with depleted LREEs, LILEs, and HFSEs with DM-type mantle isotopic characteristics from an asthenospheric mantle source, and another with higher Rb, Ba, K content and EMI-type isotopic characteristics, indicating significant contributions from the subducted Yangtze craton lower crust. These differences necessitate tailored LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS element geochemical analyses, and TIMS isotopic compositions to accurately capture the distinct geochemical signatures and emplacement ages.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures and instruments utilized include LA-ICP-MS for zircon dating, which involves laser ablation to analyze the isotopic composition of zircon crystals. XRF (X-ray fluorescence) and ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) are employed for elemental geochemical analysis, allowing for the determination of major and trace element concentrations. TIMS (Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry) is used for obtaining Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions, providing insights into the source characteristics and emplacement ages of the mafic dikes. These methods collectively help identify two distinct emplacement ages of ~460 Ma and ~220 Ma, contrasting with previous results of ~680-650 Ma. The Early Paleozoic magmas are characterized as enriched in LREEs, LILEs, and HFSEs with EMII-type mantle isotopic features, while the Early Mesozoic dikes are divided into two types with distinct elemental and isotopic signatures, indicating different mantle source contributions.",
