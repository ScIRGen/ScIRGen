            "description": "This data is the detrital zircon data of the upper Shihezi Formation of the middle and Late Permian on the southwest margin of the North China plate, which is the experimental data. More than 5kg sandstone samples were collected in the field. Zircon was separated from the samples and made targets by heavy liquid and magnetic separation technology. Single grain zircon LA-ICP-MS microanalysis was carried out in the State Key Laboratory of continental dynamics of Northwestern University. The sample collection, pretreatment and experimental process are carried out according to strict standards, and the data quality is reliable. The results show that the zircon ages range from 254 to 2700 Ma, and the main peak ages are ~ 320 Ma, ~ 1765 Ma and ~ 2495 Ma, respectively. Combined with the regional geological background and sedimentological data, it is considered that the peak age of ~ 320mA can come from the northern margin of the North China plate; This also suggests that the paleotopography of the upper Shihezi Formation was high in the north and low in the south. The provenance information reflected by the middle Late Permian detrital zircon data on the southwest margin of the North China plate can provide data support for reconstructing the paleogeography of the North China plate at that time.",

The ~320Ma peak may indicate contributions from the northern margin of the North China Block, implying a paleotopography with a higher northern region and a lower southern region during the Upper Shihezi Formation period. This age distribution provides insights into the sedimentary provenance and assists in reconstructing the paleogeography of the North China Block during the Middle to Late Permian.",

This method, combined with strict standards in sample collection, pre-treatment, and testing processes, results in data that are considered reliable. The accurate dating of zircon ages, ranging from 254-2700 Ma with main age peaks, provides insights into the provenance of the sediments, supporting geological interpretations such as the source of the ~320 Ma peak from the northern margin of the North China Plate and the paleotopography during the Upper Shihezi Formation period.",
