            "description": "In April 1999, Landsat 7 was launched. As a supplement and enhancement to the Landsat series, the sensor it carried was ETM+. The parameters of each band were close to those of Landsat 5, but the resolution of panchromatic band with a resolution of 15m was added, and the resolution of thermal infrared band was improved to 60m.\nAt present, there are 85 ETM + data scenes in heihe river basin.Data acquisition time is 1999-07-07, 1999-09-23 (2 scenes), 1999-10-18, 1999-11-26, 2000-01-20, 2000-04-20, 2000-05-06 (2 scenes), 2000-05-20, 2000-06-14 (2 scenes), 2000-07-07 (2 scenes), 2000-07-08, 2000-08-10, 2000-10-02, 2000-10-11,2000-10-13, 2001-05-25, 2001-07-03, 2001-08-20 (2 king), 2001-10-23, 2002-05-03, 2002-05-28, 2002-06-13, 2002-06-29, 2002-07-24, 2004-12-11, 2005-07-23, 2005-09-09, 2005-10-09, 2006-05-07,2006-05-21, 2006-06-24, 2006-07-26, 2006-08-25, 2006-12-01, 2007-08-12, 2008-01-05, 2008-02-06, 2008-03-25, 2008-05-10, 2008-05-19, 2008-05-28, 2008-06-04, 2008-07-15 (2 scenes), 2008-07-22, 2008-08-16 (4 scenes),2008-08-30, 2008-09-08, 2008-09-15, 2008-09-17, 2008-10-01, 2008-10-10 (2 scenes), 2008-10-19 (3 scenes), 2008-10-26 (3 scenes), 2008-11-02, 2008-11-04 (4 scenes), 2008-11-18, 2008-11-20 (4 scenes), 2008-11-27 (3 scenes), 2008-12-04, 2008-12-062008-12-13 (3 scenes).",

                    "Answer": "The collection of Landsat ETM+ remote sensing imagery data over the Heihe River Basin from 1999 to 2008 is significant due to the enhanced capabilities of the ETM+ sensor, which include a 15m resolution panchromatic band and improved 60m resolution in the thermal infrared band. These features allow for detailed and accurate monitoring of land cover changes, hydrological dynamics, and ecological conditions in the basin over a near-decade period. The imagery can support various research objectives such as tracking seasonal and annual environmental changes, aiding in water resource management, and assessing the impacts of human activities and climate change on the region.",
