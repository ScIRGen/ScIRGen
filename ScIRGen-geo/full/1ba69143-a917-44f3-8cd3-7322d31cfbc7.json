            "description": "The analytical method of SM Nd isotope can be referred to (MA et al., 1998). The isotopic composition was measured on the MC-ICPMS, and the 143Nd / 144Nd ratio was corrected by 146nd / 144Nd = 0.7219, which was completed in 2020. The parameters used in the calculation are: (143Nd / 144Nd) 0chur = 0.512638, (147sm / 144Nd) 0chur = 0.1967, (143Nd / 144Nd) 0dm = 0.51315, (147sm / 144Nd) 0dm = 0.2137. The decay constant is λ（ 147Sm）=0.00654Ga-1。",
