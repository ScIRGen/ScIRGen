            "description": "From January 2018 to April 2021, 34 clinical samples were obtained, including 17 cases of atherosclerosis and 17 cases of normal arteries. The potential role of TPM2 in atherosclerosis was explored by bioinformatics analysis. Using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting to detect TPM2 and α- Expression of SMA protein. RT-qPCR detection of TPM2 and α- SMA mRNA expression level. Establish a neural network and intima media thickness model. There is a strong correlation between the thickness of the intima media and the relative expression of TPM2 protein (P<0.001, R=-0.579). The expression of TPM2 in atherosclerosis group was lower than that in normal artery group (P<0.05). Single factor logistic regression showed that TPM2 (OR=0.150, 95% CI: 0.026-0.868, P=0.034) was significantly correlated with atherosclerosis. Successfully constructed a neural network model with a correlation of 0.94434.",

                    "Answer": "Biological information analysis in this context refers to the use of bioinformatics tools and techniques to investigate the potential role of TPM2 in atherosclerosis. This involves analyzing data such as protein and mRNA expression levels using methods like immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and RT-qPCR, to understand the relationship between TPM2 expression and atherosclerosis.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods for assessing TPM2 and α-SMA expression involve immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting for protein expression, while RT-qPCR is used for mRNA expression levels. These methods vary in technological complexity and accuracy, with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence offering spatial resolution and localization of protein expression, whereas western blotting provides quantitative protein data. RT-qPCR offers high sensitivity and quantitative data for mRNA expression but does not provide spatial information.",

                    "Answer": "The strong correlation between intima-media thickness and TPM2 protein expression levels (P<0.001, R=-0.579) suggests that changes in TPM2 expression may be linked to the structural alterations in the arterial walls seen in atherosclerosis. This could imply that TPM2 plays a role in the pathological process, potentially serving as a biomarker or therapeutic target in the progression of atherosclerosis.",

It may uncover the association between TPM2 expression levels and arterial health, indicating that TPM2 expression is lower in atherosclerosis samples compared to normal arteries. This analysis might also highlight the strong correlation between intima-media thickness and TPM2 protein expression, as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of a neural network model in predicting atherosclerosis based on TPM2 expression, with a correlation of 0.94434.",
