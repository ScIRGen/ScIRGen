            "description": "This data set is in-situ HF-O isotope data of zircon from Cretaceous granite in aliqiu area of South Pamir Plateau. The sample types analyzed include biotite granite and granodiorite. Zircon HF-O test is analyzed by cameca IMS 1280hr secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The test unit is the State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The internal precision of single analysis of 18O / 16O ratio is generally better than 0.2 ‰ (1 σ)。 The repeatability of Penglai standard data is 10.0 ‰, and the repeatability of external standard data is 10.0 ‰. The data comes from the articles under review. The data set can be used to study the petrogenesis and tectonic setting of magmatic rocks in Pamir Plateau.",
