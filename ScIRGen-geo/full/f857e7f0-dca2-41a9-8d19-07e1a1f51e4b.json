            "description": "The dataset of spectral reflectance observations was obtained by ASD (Analytical Sepctral Devices) in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas. Reflectance was calculated based on the equation R = (DN1/DN0)×R0, DN1 indicating DN of the targets, R0 and DN0 the reflectance and DN of the grey board.\n     The reflectance spectra of maize and wheat canopy, the component leaf of the maize and BRDF in Yingke oasis maize field, Yingke oasis wheat field, Huazhaizi desert maize field, the transect spectrum in Huazhaizi desert No. 1 and 2 plots and Linze and Biandukou foci experimental area were measured on May 20, 24, 25, 28 and 30, Jun. 1, 4, 9, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29 and 30, Jul. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11, 2008. Four ASD devices were used, from Peking University (350-2500nm), Institute of Remote Sensing Applications (350-2500nm), Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences (350-1065nm) and BNU respectively. The reference boards were 40%, 50% and 99%. \n     The above spectral reflectance dataset was synchronizing with WiDAS (Wide-angle Infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner), OMIS-II and various spaceborne sensors.\nRaw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro), and pre-processed data on reflectance were in Excel format.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using ASD spectrometers in the Heihe region involves measuring spectral reflectance with devices that cover a wavelength range of 350-2500nm, which is particularly suitable for capturing detailed spectral data across various land cover types such as cornfields, wheat fields, and desert areas. This method is complemented by satellite and airborne sensors like WiDAS and OMIS-II, providing a comprehensive approach that allows cross-validation between different sensors and enhances the accuracy and applicability of the spectral data to diverse land cover types.",

This approach can enhance the accuracy and reliability of reflectance and BRDF measurements due to cross-verification between instruments, especially when using reference reflectance panels for calibration. The combination of data from different instruments might also aid in effectively synchronizing satellite and airborne spectral data, thus improving the integration of ground-based and remote sensing datasets.",

                    "Answer": "To ensure accuracy and consistency of spectral reflectance measurements using ASD spectrometers, the following procedures are utilized: Measurements are calibrated using reference reflectance panels with known reflectivity values (40%, 50%, and 99%) to standardize the readings. Multiple ASD spectrometers from different institutions are employed to cross-verify data, with primary measurements conducted using instruments that cover a wavelength range of 350-2500nm. Specific measurement intervals and locations are established, focusing on varied land covers such as oasis maize fields, wheat fields, and desert sites. Consistent measurement dates are maintained, and instruments are compared through inter-instrument comparison trials, as seen on dates like 2008-07-11 for instrument comparison. This structured approach helps manage the variability across different land covers and measurement settings.",
