            "description": "Snow, ice, and glaciers have the highest albedo of any part of Earth's surface. The increase in melting of the polar ice sheet results in a rapid and sequential decrease in albedo and subsequently influences the global energy balance. The hydrological system derived from surface melt and basal meltwater will affect the dynamic stability of ice sheet and therefore mass balance. The dataset combined microwave radiometer product and optical albedo product, the daily, winter (June-August) averages and July averages of the former are used for layer-stacking, then Gram-Schmidt Spectral Sharpening was adapted to fuse the layer-stacking results with MODIS GLASS albedo product. The spatial resolution of fusion-results has been downscaled from 25 km to 0.05˚. By employing a threshold-based melt detection approach for each fusion-results pixel, Antarctic ice sheet surface melt daily product for 1985-1986, 2000-2001, 2015-2016 (DSSMIS) was generated. The spatial resolution of DSSMIS is higher than that of published data sets at home and abroad. Combined with the advantages of radiometer and albedo data, the spatial details characteristics are enhanced and consistent with the extraction range of the original radiometer products, effectively reducing the noise of the radiometer. It better reflects the melting gradient of mountainous area, groundline area and ice shelf over time, DSSMIS has a higher accuracy. DSSMIS’s data type is integer, where 1 is melted, 0 is not melted, 255 is masked area besides Antarctic ice sheet, and the data set is stored as *.nc.",
            "instructions": "File name: the surface melting data is stored in NC format. The file name is \"antarcticcdailysurfacemeltyyyy-yyyy. NC\", where yyyy-yyyy represents the year. For example, ‘antarcticcdailysurfacemelt1985-1986.nc’ represents the NC file, which describes the surface melting range of the Antarctic ice sheet from July 1, 1985 to June 30, 1986. The NC file contains four variables: melt and polar_ Stereographic, x and y, respectively represent the melting pixel value, coordinate system information, X coordinate and Y coordinate in the projection coordinate system.\n\nData reading method: all NC files in the dataset can be directly read by panoply program （https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/download/ ）, select the variable melt , create the XY coordinate axis corresponding to the variable x and variable y for browsing, and change the time to browse the melting range of different dates. If you want to save it as a separate picture for display or analysis, you can use the \"multidimensional tool - create NetCDF grid layer\" tool in ArcGIS program to process the results and generate a file in TIF format, including the melting range of all days in the corresponding year. You can change the display time by opening \"enable time in this layer\" in the \"attribute - time\" tab. In addition, you can also select GDAL, NCO, CDO and other tools to open NC files or convert them to other formats.",

                "The melting of the Antarctic ice sheet surface is a sensitive factor in global climate change, significantly impacting the material and energy balance of the Antarctic ice sheet. As global temperatures rise, the runoff generated by the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is a major source of uncertainty in predicting future climate and sea level changes. Therefore, further deepening our understanding of Antarctic ice sheet melting is of great significance. Currently, the frozen-thaw products of the Antarctic ice sheet released by domestic and international sources are mostly derived from microwave radiometer data, which has a relatively low spatial resolution (25 km). Additionally, using a single sensor to detect ice sheet surface melting under different conditions (latitude, altitude, terrain, etc.) has its limitations. Microwave scatterometers are more sensitive to liquid water in the snowpack than microwave radiometers; microwave radiometers perform best in areas with intense melting; model data, which takes terrain factors into account, can provide a good supplement in mountainous regions where satellite remote sensing is difficult to operate."

After registration, the Categorical Triple Collocation (CTC) method is employed for fusion, resulting in a freeze-thaw product for the Antarctic ice sheet from 1999 to 2019. First, the freeze-thaw time series from each data source is obtained using the threshold method, and after registration, the CTC method is used to evaluate relative accuracy and fuse the products. The threshold method identifies change points in the microwave radiometer brightness temperature (Tb) and microwave scatterometer backscatter (σ0). When the microwave brightness temperature or backscatter exceeds or falls below the winter average by a certain threshold, it is determined to be a melting signal. After registering the products from different data sources, CTC obtains their relative accuracy by decomposing the 3×3 covariance matrix of the three sets of ice sheet surface melting monitoring products."
