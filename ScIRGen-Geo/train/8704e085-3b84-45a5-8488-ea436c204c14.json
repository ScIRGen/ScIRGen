      "description": "By building a WEB-DHM model that couples the hydrological and physical processes of the cryosphere, such as snow, frozen soil, and glaciers, the spatio-temporal dynamics and driving mechanism of water resources in the source areas of the seven major rivers on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, the Mekong River, the Nu River, the the Yarlung Zangbo River, the Ganges River, and the Indus River) were quantitatively analyzed, and the monthly, 5km water resources data products (including runoff and evaporation) (referred to as TPRED) for each basin from 1998 to 2017 were simulated.",

        "To date, generating reliable runoff and ET datasets for high-altitude river basins across the TP has been challenging, hindered by the scarcity of quality-controlled observational data. This lack is exacerbated by harsh environmental conditions, infrastructural limitations, and restrictive data-sharing policies, particularly for transboundary river data. The limited availability of observed data presents challenges in accurately depicting the large-scale spatial heterogeneity of hydrometeorology in the high-mountain basins. Numerous current research approaches of gridded runoff and ET products do not adequately account for cryosphere-hydrological processes."

Additionally, TPRED’s monthly ET estimates closely align with expected seasonal fluctuations, as reflected by a CC ranging from 0.94 to 0.98 when contrasted with alternative ET products. Furthermore, TPRED’s annual values exhibit commendable concordance with operational products across multiple dimensions. Ultimately, the TPRED will have great application on hydrometeorology, carbon transport, water management, hydrological modeling, and sustainable development of water resources."

        "AnswerEn": "The challenges in generating reliable runoff and evapotranspiration datasets for high-altitude river basins include scarcity of quality-controlled observational data, harsh environmental conditions, infrastructural limitations, and restrictive data-sharing policies for transboundary river data. These issues are compounded by the limited availability of observed data, which makes accurately depicting the large-scale spatial heterogeneity of hydrometeorology in high-mountain basins difficult. Potential solutions could involve enhancing data-sharing policies, improving observational infrastructure, and integrating advanced modeling techniques that account for cryosphere-hydrological processes, as demonstrated by the WEB-DHM model used in the field.",
        "AnswerCn": "在高海拔流域生成可靠的径流和蒸散发数据集面临的挑战包括缺乏经过质量控制的观测数据、恶劣的环境条件、基础设施的限制以及对跨界河流数据的限制性数据共享政策。这些问题因观测数据的有限可用性而加剧，使得准确描绘高山流域的水文气象大规模空间异质性变得困难。潜在的解决方案可能包括加强数据共享政策、改善观测基础设施，以及整合先进的建模技术，以考虑冰冻圈-水文过程，正如在该领域使用的WEB-DHM模型所示。",
