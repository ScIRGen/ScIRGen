            "description": "The data include sampling information, age, elements, isotopes, hand specimen photos, micrographs, geochemical characteristics and diagenetic model maps of Jurassic granites in Sulu orogenic belt. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) was used to determine the major elements with an accuracy of less than 2%, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the trace elements with an accuracy of less than 5%. The zircon U-Pb isotopic age was determined by SIMS. The data have been published in Journal of petroleum, an international well-known petrological journal, which has important implications for the post collisional evolution of the Sulu orogenic belt.",
