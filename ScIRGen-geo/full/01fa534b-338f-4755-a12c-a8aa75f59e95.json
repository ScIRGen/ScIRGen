                "Evapotranspiration (ET, soil evaporation+ vegetation transpiration) is one of the key variables in the water and energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere and it accounts for about 60% of the annual land precipitation in the global hydrological cycle. Meanwhile, accurate knowledge of vegetation transpiration is essential and critical for better allocating water resources and improving water-use efficiency in the irrigated agriculture. Over the past several decades, a great number of semi-physical and physical single- and two-source models, with varying degree of complexity and accuracy, have been developed to estimate regional ET from satellite remote sensing data. The single-source energy balance models, which generally rely on the surface-air temperature difference to derive regional components of the surface energy balance, are often subject to the errors in sensor calibration, atmospheric corrections, and specification of the surface emissivity. To accommodate the difference between radiometric and aerodynamic surface temperatures in the single-source models, a remote sensing two-source energy balance model (hereafter referred to N95 model) and its several variants were developed by Norman et al., Wang and Dickinson, and Kustas and Norman to estimate the surface energy balance of soil and vegetation components. These two-source energy balance models are also able to avoid empirical corrections for the excess resistance in the single-source models and can further incorporate the effects of view geometry. However, estimation of the parallel or series resistance network somewhat complicates the application of these two-source models over a wide range of surface fractional vegetation cover and soil water availability conditions. The surface temperature (TR)–vegetation index (VI) triangle/trapezoid space models, which virtually are interpolating schemes between potential ET at the wet end-member/edge and minimum ET at the dry end-member/edge, have attracted most attentions in recent years for the remote sensing estimation of regional ET at different spatial scales."

Accurate estimates of z0m with high spatio-temporal resolution at regional and global scale could greatly benefit the improvement of the simulation of land–atmosphere interactions, the development of high spatio-temporal resolution land surface/earth system models, and the better understanding of the Earth-Mankind in the past, nowadays, and future. Over the past decades, substantial physical and empirical methods have been developed to parameterize z0m for different land cover types at different scales. The typical physical method is to deduce z0m by applying logarithmic wind profile equation with meteorological measurements at different levels or by numerically solving the turbulent transfer model. This method is advantageous for its physical basis and spatio-temporal consistency of the z0m estimates, but may be only applicable at restricted sites, largely subject to the uncertainties of involved numerous empirically determined parameters, or almost impossible to accurately estimate the z0m magnitude at regional scale, mesoscale and global scale."
