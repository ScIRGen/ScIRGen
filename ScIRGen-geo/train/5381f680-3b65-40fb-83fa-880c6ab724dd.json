            "description": "The contents include electron microprobe data and microscopic photographs of the chemical compositions of the granitic dioritic mylonites from Yunmengshan area, Beijing. The EPMA data of Mineral chemical composition were obtained by Joel jxa8230 EPMA instrument in the school of resources and environment, Hefei University of technology. The experimental conditions are as follows: accelerating voltage 15kV, testing current 20na, electron beam spot diameter 5 μ m. For smaller particles, 3 μ M beam spot. The data detection time is 10 ~ 20s, and the experimental error is 0 ± 2%。 Natural minerals were used as standard samples. A total of 5 rock samples were tested. For each matrix mineral (plagioclase, potash feldspar, amphibole) in each sample, at least 3 particles are tested, and generally 3-4 probe points are tested for each mineral particle. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was also performed on the representative plagioclase and K-feldspar plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclase plagioclas. The chemical composition data of representative minerals are listed in the table.\nThis data can provide data support for the specific temperature conditions and variation rules of ductile deformation of mylonite in Yunmeng Mountain, Beijing.",
