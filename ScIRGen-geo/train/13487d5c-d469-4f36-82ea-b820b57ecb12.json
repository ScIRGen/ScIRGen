            "description": "1 km land cover map of heihe river basin is ran youhua et al. (2009;2011) develop a subset of China's 1 km land cover map (MICLCover) incorporating multi-source local information.The MICLCover land cover map adopts the IGBP land cover classification system, based on the evidence theory, which integrates the 1:100,000 land use data of China in 2000, the vegetation pattern of China vegetation atlas (1:100,000), the 1:100,000 glacier distribution map of China, the 1:100,000 swamp wetland map of China and the land cover product of MODIS in 2001 (MOD12Q1).The verification results of MICLCover showed that the overall consistency of MICLCover and China's land use map reached 88.84% on the level of 7 categories. Among them, the consistency of cultivated land, city, wetland and water type reached more than 95%.Through visual comparison with the land cover data product of MODIS2001 and IGBPDISCover land cover map in three typical areas, MICLCover keeps the overall accuracy of China's land use map and increases the leaf attribute and leaf shape information of China's vegetation map, while reflecting more detailed local land cover details.Using the national forest resources survey data, the verification results in gansu, yunnan, zhejiang, heilongjiang and jilin provinces showed that the accuracy of forest types of MICLCover was significantly improved compared with that of MODIS land cover products.The forest type of MICLCover was verified with the forest resource survey data of qilian mountain national nature reserve administration of gansu province. The results showed that the accuracy of MICLCover forest type in this area was 82.94%.\nAnyhow, MICLCover land cover map while maintaining the overall precision of the Chinese land use data condition, supplement the vegetation map of China on vegetation types and vegetation season phase information, update the Chinese wetland figure, Chinese ice figure the latest information, the accuracy of China's land cover data is greatly improved, more general classification system, the data can provide higher precision for land surface process model of land cover information.",
