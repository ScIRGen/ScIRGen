            "description": "The dataset of the survey at the sampling plots in the transit zone between oasis and desert was obtained in the Linze station foci experimental area. Observation items included:\n     (1) soil moisture and temperature of the soil profiles (0-10cm, 10-20cm, 20-30cm and 30-40cm) measured by the cutting ring method (50cm^3, once each layer) and the probe thermometer (15cm, twice each layer) on May 25, 2008. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) biomass (green weight and dry weight, samples from 0.5m×0.5m) with photos measured by the plant harvesting in LY07 quadrate on Jun. 22, 2008. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     (3) vegetation coverage measured by the diagonal method on Jun. 22, 2008. By estimating the coverage along the two diagonals, the total coverage of the plot can be developed. Data were archived as Excel files.",

                    "Answer": "The observed patterns in soil moisture and temperature, collected through soil profiling at different depths, can provide insights into the environmental and climatic conditions of the desert transition zone. Variations in soil moisture levels across the 0-10cm, 10-20cm, 20-30cm, and 30-40cm layers may indicate the infiltration rate of water and its retention capacity, which can be influenced by precipitation events, evaporation rates, and soil composition. Similarly, temperature variations might reflect daily and seasonal temperature changes, solar radiation penetration, and heat transfer within the soil. These patterns can help infer the overall soil health, potential plant growth conditions, and the resilience of the ecosystem to climatic variations during the measurement period in late May 2008.",

The use of specific soil depth layers (0-10cm, 10-20cm, 20-30cm, 30-40cm) allows for detailed understanding of soil moisture and temperature variations, which can affect plant growth and ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, employing different biomass collection methods, such as the harvesting method and proportional sampling for larger plants, can impact the precision of biomass data and the interpretation of ecological interactions within the desert transition zone.",
