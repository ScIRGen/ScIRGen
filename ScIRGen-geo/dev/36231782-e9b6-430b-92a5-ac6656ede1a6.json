            "description": "The data were collected from the debris flow model test system located in the plant area of Aosite Slope Protection Engineering Co., Ltd. in Qingbaijiang District, Chengdu. The system is a multifunctional large-scale test device designed and built independently, which can be used to simulate the surface dynamic mechanism and protection of geological disasters. Compared with the famous large-scale geological disaster dynamic process model test system built by the U.S. Geological Survey, the system can change the slope arbitrarily, and can observe the transformation of debris flow or debris flow flow state and structure from the side. Based on the test system, the instruments used in the pre experiment mainly include: data acquisition instrument, laser displacement sensor, impact force sensor, acceleration sensor, microseismic sensor, high-speed camera, camera, three-dimensional laser scanner and UAV.",
