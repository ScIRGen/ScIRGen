      "description": "The basic data source of this dataset is from the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA satellites are meteorological observation satellites. Provide meteorological environment information including temperature, precipitation, dew point, wind speed, etc. This dataset mainly covers key nodes in the pan-third pole Southeast Asia and Middle East regions. The main steps of data processing are as follows: First, according to the definition of high temperature heat waves in China's national standard \"GB / T 29457-2012\", based on basic meteorological data, determine the occurrence of high temperature heat waves, and then statistically obtain the frequency of high temperature heat waves. The time and occurrence intensity are collated to obtain the historical high temperature heat wave disaster event data set. This data set is helpful for clarifying the occurrence of extreme high temperature disasters in each study area, and provides reference materials and a strong basis for judging the intensity of high temperature heat waves in each area.",

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) is one of a handful of groups that produces a global temperature product (land and ocean). Other groups include the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climate Research Unit, which jointly developed the HadCRUT4 data set, and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), which developed the GISS Surface Temperature (GISTEMP) analysis. A common characterization of this uncertainty is the standard error time series. For annual time series of U.S. and global temperature, the standard errors can be quite large compared to the typical year-to-year fluctuation in the time series values. This concept was explored by Guttorp and Kim, who used a Monte Carlo approach to characterize the uncertainty of annual rankings for the U.S. temperature time series."
