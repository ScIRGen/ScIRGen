      "description": "The dataset is the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) products of 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the NDMI equation which use the difference ratio between the NIR band and SWIR2 band to quantitatively reflect the water content of vegetation canopy .And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.NDMI is highly correlated with canopy water content and can be used to estimate vegetation water content, and it is also used to analyze the change of land surface temperature because it is strongly correlated with land surface temperature.\n",
      "descriptionCn": "1）数据内容：本数据集包含2020年青藏高原地区Landsat长时序归一化差值水分（NDMI）产品。2）数据来源及加工方法：主要是在青藏高原Landsat系列卫星地表反射率数据集的基础上，通过NDMI的计算公式进行生产的，即利用近红外与短波红外之间的差异来定量化反映植被冠层的水分含量情况；3）数据质量描述：为了标识云、冰雪，并相应生产了质量标识文件（QA）。4) 数据应用成果及前景：NDMI与冠层水分含量高度相关，可以用来估计植被水分含量，而且NDMI与地表温度之间存在较强的相关性，因此也常用于分析地表温度的变化情况。\n",
      "instructions": "1)File name rules: the NDMI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the NDMI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDMI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDMI;the NDMI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDMI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDMI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the NDMI results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the NDMI results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.\n",
      "instructionsCn": "文件命名：NDMI是以景为单位存放文件夹，由NDMI波段、质量文件（Quality Assessment, QA）、元数据、缩略图组成，文件夹的命名规则为：卫星-传感器-path-row-成像日期-LSR-BRDF-NDMI，如L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDMI；其中NDWI产品是以GeoTIFF格式存储的，命名规则为：卫星-传感器-path-row-成像日期-LSR-BRDF-NDMI.TIF，如L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDMI.TIF。数据使用方法：NDMI结果可使用Arcgis、ENVI、QGIS等软件打开，为了降低存储空间，NDMI结果由原本的0~1范围内的浮点型均乘以10000变成16位整型，所以使用时需要将结果乘以0.0001，背景填充值为-9999，并进行了“LZW”的无损压缩。\n",

        "Glacier mass changes in the Himalayas are a subject of societal concern due to their impact on many large Asian rivers that are relied upon for sustainable water resources; their effect on hazards in downstream regions such as glacial lake outburst floods; and their effect on the availability of Himalayan paleoclimate records from ice cores. Recent studies show that Himalayan glaciers have experienced rapid thinning and shrinkage and that the rates of observed mass changes are spatially and temporally variable. The drivers for the spatiotemporal variability are not well understood and a variety of factors have been proposed to explain it, including debris cover, glacier-lake interactions, morphological variables, climate variability (patterns in air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation) and the response of individual glaciers to climate variability."

        "In October 2010, 39 monitoring stakes were drilled into the ice, distributed across the entire glacier surface. In early October for each year of the study, we manually recorded the stake heights and snow-pit features (snow layer density and stratigraphy) to derive the annual point mass balance. Two automatic weather stations (AWSs) were installed on a lateral moraine beside Naimona'nyi Glacier. AWS1, at 5,543 m a.s.l., recorded meteorological variables from October 2011 at half hourly resolution, including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and downward shortwave radiation (Sin). AWS2 was installed at 5,950 m a.s.l. in October 2010 and recorded Ta, RH, Sin, WS, and WD at hourly resolution. Precipitation data was obtained from all-weather precipitation gauges (T-200B) equipped with hanging weighing transducers installed close to AWS2 in September 2013. Two air temperature and humidity sensors (T1 and T2) were installed on Naimona'nyi Glacier in October 2018 at 6,075 and 5,984 m a.s.l., respectively, to measure gradients in air temperature and relative humidity."

        "The area of the glacier is 7.34 km2 and it ranges in altitude from ∼5,545 to 7,261.5 m above sea level (a.s.l.). The mass balance was measured using the glaciological method for the northern branch of Naimona'nyi Glacier since 2004. The annual glacier-wide mass balance Ba (m w.e.) is calculated according to:      1 1 , n iii a n ii BSB S (1) where n is the total number of altitude intervals for Naimona'nyi Glacier; Si (m2) is the area for each interval; B i (m w.e.) is the point mass balance at the middle altitude at each individual interval, which is calculated by the interpolation and extrapolation of the point mass balance at stakes."

      "findings": [
        "The average annual mass balance measured for Naimona'nyi Glacier was −0.39 m water equivalent a−1 and point mass balances below 6,070 m above sea level were always negative. Simulations showed that melt during the ablation season dominated the annual mass balance and the interannual variability in the mass balance, and that variability in melt energy was controlled by albedo during the ablation season. The annual mass balance was found to be significantly correlated with annual precipitation during the 2011–2018 period, which is accounted for by the change in ablation-season albedo and melt energy. The average mass balance for glaciers in the western Himalayas were higher during the 2010–2019 period than during the 2000–2009 period, partly because of higher annual precipitation during the 2010–2019 period. Over the last 20 years, the increased precipitation in the cold season was driven by a cyclonic circulation anomaly over the northwestern Indian Peninsula, which may be linked to the strengthened North Atlantic Oscillation, and the increased precipitation in the ablation season was driven by an anomaly in the cyclonic circulation over Central India, which may be related to enhanced deep convection over the Indian subcontinent and the enhanced Atlantic multidecadal oscillation."
