It is expressed in geographic coordinates using the decimal degree. The main contents include: marsh wetland types, wetland water supply types, soil types, main vegetation types, geographical area, etc. Implemented the \"Standard for Information Classification and Coding of Sustainable Development Information Sharing System of China\". Data source of this database: 1:20 swamp map (internal version), Tibetan Plateau 1: 500,000 swamp map (internal version), swamp survey data 1: 1 million and national 1: 4 million swamp map; processing steps are: data source selection, preprocessing, digitization and encoding of marsh wetland elements, data editing processing, establishing topological relationships, edge processing, projection conversion, linking with attribute databases such as place names and obtaining attribute data.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection for 1:100万 scale wetland information focuses on providing a broader overview of marshland types, water source types, soil types, vegetation types, and geographic regions, using a standardized geographical coordinate system. In contrast, finer scales such as 1:20 or 1:50万, derived from sources like internal swamp maps, likely offer more detailed and accurate representations of specific wetland features due to their higher resolution. The 1:100万 scale data undergoes several processing steps such as digitization, coding, and projection transformation, which may affect the level of detail and accuracy compared to finer scales.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of specific data sources like the 1:20 swamp maps and the Tibetan Plateau 1:50,000 marsh map for creating a dataset is influenced by the need for detailed and accurate representation of wetland information. These sources provide comprehensive coverage and detailed data necessary for capturing the diverse characteristics of marshlands, such as marsh type, water source replenishment type, soil type, and major vegetation types. This ensures the dataset reflects the geographical and ecological diversity accurately.",

                    "Answer": "The main objectives behind developing a dataset that reflects national marshland information at a 1:100万 scale are to provide detailed insights into the types of marshland, water source replenishment types, soil types, main vegetation types, and geographical regions in the 2000s across China. This contributes to understanding marshland ecosystems by offering a standardized and comprehensive data source that can be used for environmental monitoring, sustainable development planning, and scientific research. The use of such a dataset aids in consistent classification and coding of marshland features, facilitating better management and conservation efforts.",
