            "description": "This data set includes detrital composition, detrital zircon U-Pb isotopic age and zircon Hf isotopic data of Carboniferous Permian and Jurassic Cretaceous sandstones from Bannu belt to Lhasa block, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The sampling time is from 2018 to 2019, and the samples are distributed in Nanqiangtang and Bannu zones. Rock samples include 9 sandstones, 1 flysch and 2 pyroclastic rocks. The discussion based on the data provides an important basis for defining the opening and closing time of Bangong Nujiang ocean in the central Tibetan Plateau, which is of great significance for the study of Bangong Nujiang ocean. The detrital composition of sandstone is mainly analyzed by thin section method and point counting method. The zircon U-Pb dating is performed by laser ablation plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and the zircon Hf isotope is measured by multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), The testing units include the Key Laboratory of Northeast Asian mineral resources evaluation, Ministry of natural resources, Jilin University and Beijing Kehui Testing Technology Co., Ltd. This data set has been published in the international SCI journals tectonics and palaeogeography, palaeolimatology, palaeoecology, and has been cited many times. The data results are true and reliable.",
