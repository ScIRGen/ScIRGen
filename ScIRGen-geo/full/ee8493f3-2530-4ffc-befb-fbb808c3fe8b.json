            "description": "The dateset of surface roughness measurements was obtained in the Biandukou foci experimental area. With the roughness grid board 110cm long and the measuring  intervals of 1cm, the samples were collected along the  soil surface from south to north and from east to west, respectively.\n     The coordinates of the sample would be got with the help of ArcView; and after geometric correction, surface height standard deviation (cm) and correlation length (cm) could be acquired based on the formula listed on pages 234-236, Microwave Remote Sensing, Vol. II.\n     The original photos of each sampling point, surface height standard deviation (cm) and correlation length (cm) were included. The roughness data files were initialized by the sample name, which was followed by the serial number, the name of the file, standard deviation and correlation length. Each .txt file is matched with one sample photo and standard deviation and correlation length represent the roughness. In addition, the length of 101 needles is also included for further checking.",

                    "Answer": "Surface roughness measurements are significant in remote sensing experiments as they provide information on the texture and structure of the land surface, which can influence microwave scattering and other remote sensing signals. It is typically quantified by measuring the surface height standard deviation and correlation length. In this context, measurements are taken using a digital camera to capture images of the sampling points, which are then digitized to determine the height of rods on a roughness board. The standard deviation of the surface heights and the correlation length are calculated based on these measurements, as detailed in the reference '微波遥感' (Microwave Remote Sensing) Volume 2, pages 234-236.",

Digitized sampling techniques from photographs allow for precise and detailed analysis of surface features, enabling researchers to calculate standard deviation of surface height and correlation length, which are essential for microwave remote sensing applications.",

At each sampling point, measurements are taken in both north-south and east-west directions. Roughness data is collected using digital photography, capturing images of each sampling point. In ArcView software, the photos are manually digitized to sample the top of each spoke and the four corners of the board, obtaining their image coordinates. After geometric correction, the height of each spoke is calculated. Surface height standard deviation and correlation length are then computed using the formulas provided in the reference book 'Microwave Remote Sensing', Volume 2, pages 234-236.",
