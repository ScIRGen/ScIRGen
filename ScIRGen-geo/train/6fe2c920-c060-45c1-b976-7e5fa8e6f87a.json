            "description": "This dataset includes the observational data from 20 September, 2012, through 31 December, 2013, collected by the Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observation System (COSMOS), called crs, which waslocated at 100.372° E, 38.856° N and 1557 m above sea level,near the Daman Superstation in the Daman Irrigation District, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The land cover in the footprint was a maize crop. The bottom of the probe was 0.5 m above the ground, and the sampling interval was 1 hour.\nThe raw COSMOS data include the following: battery (Batt, V), temperature (T, ℃), relative humidity (RH, %), air pressure (P, hPa), fast neutron counts (N1C, counts per hour), thermal neutron counts (N2C, counts per hour), the sample time of fast neutrons (N1ET, s), and the sample time of thermal neutrons (N2ET, s). The distributed data include the following variables: Date, Time, P, N1C, N1C_cor (corrected fast neutron counts) and VWC (volume soil moisture, %), which were processed as follows:\n1) Quality control\nData were deleted and replaced by -6999 when (a) the battery voltage was less than 11.8 V, (b) the relative humidity exceeded 80% inside the probe box, (c) the samping durationwere less than 59 minutes or greater than 61 minutes  and (d) the neutron count differed from the previous value by more than 20%.\n2) Air pressure correction\nAn air pressure correction was applied to the quality-controlled raw data according to the equation containedin the equipment manual.\n3) Calibration\nAfter the quality control and corrections were applied, the soil moisture was calculated using the equation in Desilets et al. (2010), where N0 is the neutron counts above dry soil and the other variables are fitted constants that define the shape of the calibration function. Here, the parameter N0 was calibrated using the in situ observed soil moisture recordedby SoilNET within the footprint. \n4) Soil moisture computation\nBased on the calibrated N0 and corrected N1C, the hourly soil moisture was computed using the equation specified in the equipment manual.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for hydrometeorological observation network or sites information), Zhu et al. (2015) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "Cosmic-ray soil moisture measurement refers to a method of determining soil moisture content using cosmic-ray sensors. These sensors detect fast and thermal neutrons, which are influenced by the hydrogen atoms in water. The measurement process typically involves the correction of neutron counts for factors such as atmospheric pressure and involves calibration using known soil moisture conditions to establish a relationship between neutron counts and soil moisture content.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in quick neutron counts can provide insights into soil moisture patterns as they are directly used to compute soil volumetric water content. Challenges in calibration include the need for precise calibration of the instrument using soil samples from the measurement area and establishing a reliable relationship between soil moisture and neutron counts. Errors can arise from incorrect calibration of the N0 value or from data not meeting the selection criteria, such as voltage or humidity thresholds.",

                    "Answer": "The calibration process involves the following steps: First, identifying dry and wet conditions in the field to use for calibration data collection, such as the specific days of June 26-27 for dry conditions and July 16-17 for wet conditions. During these periods, soil moisture is measured at different depths (4 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm for dry; 4 cm and 10 cm for wet). The average soil moisture values from these measurements are then used to establish a relationship between soil volumetric water content and fast neutron counts. The average N0 value, representing fast neutron counts under dry soil conditions, is calculated (3597 in this case) to adjust and calibrate the instrument readings for accurate soil moisture estimation.",

It also involves correcting fast neutron counts for pressure using a specified formula, calibrating the instrument by determining the dry soil fast neutron count (N0), and calculating soil moisture based on established relationships between neutron counts and soil volumetric water content.",
