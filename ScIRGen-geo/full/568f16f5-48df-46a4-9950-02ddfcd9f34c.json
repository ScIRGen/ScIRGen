                "Change in lake water storage is an important factor influencing hydrological cycle, regional environment, and climate on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) because of the large number (> 1000 lakes) and huge areas (> 46,500 km2) of lakes. According to recent investigations of lakes in the Tibetan area, 1171 lakes (> 1 km2) with a total area of 4.65 × 104 km2 are located throughout the TP. Most of the lakes on the TP have expanded over the past few decades based on remote sensing images and satellite elevation data, but the southern TP is an exception, where the lakes exhibited shrinking trends. Glaciers on the TP have experienced substantial shrinkage over the past few decades, especially in the Himalaya. Increasing glacial meltwater with rising temperatures constitutes an important influence on the expansion of lakes and perhaps represents the main cause of lake expansion. Precipitation has increased over the past few decades, especially in the central TP. The amount of precipitation showed a good relationship with observed changes within lakes, and thus, increasing precipitation was considered to be the main cause of lake expansion. Lake level change is an important metric in studies of lake water storage change."

            "challenges": [
                "Due to the lack of in situ lake level monitoring for most lakes, and long-term continuous satellite altimetry data for some large lakes, estimates of water storage changes for all lakes throughout the TP over a long time is challenging. However, due to the lack of reliable observation data, quantifying both the glacier mass balance for all of the glaciers throughout the TP and the contribution from glacial meltwater to the lakes is difficult. Therefore, the main cause for lake expansion throughout the TP is still debated due to the lack of both in situ observation data and complete coverage of satellite data. Only a few large lakes have long periods of satellite image coverage based on the ICESat and Cryosat-2 data, and the estimation of total lake water storage change remains uncertain."

In this study, we have investigated the water storage changes in 315 lakes (each of them was > 10 km2 in 2013) for the period from 1976 to 2013 based on SRTM data and Landsat images. Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Image (OLI) images were used to extract the lake surface areas for 1976, 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2013, and a total of 242 images were downloaded from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website and the Geospatial Data Cloud, Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences website. The method of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), introduced for multiple purposes by different authors in 1996, was used to extract the lake boundaries. The SRTM acquired digital elevation model (DEM) data spanning > 80% of the globe during an eleven-day mission in February 2000."

            "findings": [
                "The results showed that the lake water storage decreased by 23.69 Gt from 1976 to 1990 and increased by 140.8 Gt from 1990 to 2013. Increased water storage was mainly concentrated in the central TP (regions A) and northern TP (region B). The increase in total lake surface area during the period 2000–2013 in region B (1981.6 km2) was greater than that in region A (1869.1 km2), but the increase in the water storage in the former was half of that in the latter, indicating that lake surface area changes cannot represent the degree of lake water storage change due to differences in the topography and lake size. Although the total variation in the rate of the lake water storage change (7.19 Gt/y) was similar to the rate of increase in the mass (7 ± 7 Gt/y) estimated from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for the whole region, the spatial distribution of these variations was largely different. During the period 2000–2013, a trend analysis revealed that precipitation was perhaps the primary reason for lake change throughout the TP, while a decreasing evaporation rate only contributed approximately 1.5%, 2.5% and 1.7% to the expansions of the lakes in regions A, C and D respectively. However, based on modern glacier mass balance observation data, we estimated that glacial meltwater may have contributed 22.2%, 39.8%, 50.6% and 100% to the increasing water storage during the period 2000–2013 by rough estimates in regions A, B, C and D, respectively, indicating that glacial meltwater perhaps was a primary contributor to lake expansion in region D, which was located in an extremely cold and dry climate with a broad distribution of glaciers."
