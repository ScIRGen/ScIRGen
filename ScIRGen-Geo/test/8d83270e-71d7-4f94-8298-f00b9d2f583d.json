            "description": "As the “water tower of Asia”, the Tibetan Plateau has a profound impact on the global natural environment and climate change. Therefore, analyzing the distribution characteristics of troposphere-stratospheric water vapor over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important part of understanding the water vapor source and change characterize. In situ observations are limit in this region, and the water vapor sounding data set is needed. Therefore, we carried out balloon-borne measurements at Lhasa and Kunming over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and then obtained the vertical distribution of water vapor in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The dataset is named “Pan-Third Pole Water Vapor Sounding”, which is mainly the water vapor profile data obtained by balloon sounding conducted at Lhasa and Kunming in August from July 2009 to 2019. Altitude (Altitude), Water vapor (H2O), temperature (Temp), potential temperature (K), and air pressure (Press) from near the surface to 20 km are obtained by conventional balloons soundings payloaded with the Cryogenic Frost Point Hygrometer (CFH) and radiosonde (iMet). Data is transmitted in real time to the ground receiving station via a radiosonde.",

The TTL is defined as a thermal transition layer, and its boundaries are identified from the profiles of temperature and potential temperature lapse rates only, which is particularly suited to balloon-borne measurements. The TTL can be identified from the tracer-tracer relationships. Mixing affects the transport of chemical constituents and is a key mechanism for irreversible stratosphere-troposphere exchange. The study of Pan et al.

It has been recognized in recent years that significant transport of air and pollutants from the surface into the stratosphere also occurs over the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) regions. It is crucial for global chemistry climate models to properly represent the thermodynamic structure and properties of the TTL within the ASM anticyclone, thus an in-depth study of the distribution and transport of atmospheric composition in that layer will provide more information on the transport processes from the troposphere into the stratosphere within the ASM anticyclone region, particularly the role of convection in cross-tropopause exchange."
