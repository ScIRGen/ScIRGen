            "description": "To study the intracontinental deformation characteristics of the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau, we set up short a NW-SE oriented short-period dense array across the central Altyn Tagh Fault Zone. We used the receiver function method to study the fine crustal structure of the region, with a total of 483 seismometers. We calculated the receiver function using teleseismic data with magnitudes greater than 5.5 and epicenter distances ranging from 28 ° to 95 °. After manual selecting, we obtained 7013 high-quality receiver functions, with a total of 475 stations recording effective receiver functions. The Gaussian coefficient of the receiving functions is 5.0 and the sampling rate is 20Hz. The duration of the receiving function is 105 seconds, with 5 seconds before zero time and 100 seconds after zero time. These receiver functions were used for CCP imaging to obtain the detailed crustal structure of the central Altyn Tagh Fault Zone.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of studying crustal structures in seismic research, the 'receiver function method' refers to a technique that uses seismic waves recorded by a network of seismometers to analyze subsurface structures. It involves calculating receiver functions from seismic data, particularly focusing on teleseismic events with certain criteria, such as epicentral distances and magnitudes, to extract information about the Earth's crust and upper mantle. In this field, it was used with a dense array of short-period seismic stations across a key area of the Altyn Tagh Fault to obtain detailed crustal structure using high-quality receiver functions selected from a large data set.",

This detailed crustal structure can, in turn, help infer the intracontinental deformation features at the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau by revealing variations in crustal thickness, composition, and possible tectonic activity in the area.",

This goal influences the data collection methods by necessitating the deployment of 483 short-period seismic stations in a northwest-southeast orientation across the critical segment of the fault zone. The use of the receiver function method, combined with the analysis of teleseismic events with magnitudes greater than 5.5 and epicentral distances ranging from 28° to 95°, ensures high-quality data collection to achieve detailed structural imaging.",
