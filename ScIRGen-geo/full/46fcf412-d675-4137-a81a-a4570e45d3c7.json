            "description": "Evapotranspiration over the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is calculated by etwatch, a land surface evapotranspiration remote sensing model based on multi-scale and multi-source data. Etwatch adopts the method of combining the residual term method with P-M formula to calculate evapotranspiration. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the data image, the suitable model is selected to retrieve the evapotranspiration on a sunny day; the remote sensing model is often lack of data because the weather conditions can not obtain a clear image. In order to obtain the daily continuous evapotranspiration, the penman Monteith formula is introduced, and the evapotranspiration results on a sunny day are regarded as the \"key frame\", and the surface impedance information of the key frame is used as the basis to construct the surface impedance Based on the daily meteorological data, the time series data of evapotranspiration are reconstructed. Through the data fusion model, the high spatial and temporal resolution evapotranspiration data set is constructed by combining the low and medium resolution evapotranspiration temporal variation information with the high resolution evapotranspiration spatial difference information, so as to generate the 8 km resolution evapotranspiration of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau Data sets (1990-2015).",

                "Wetlands, as an important component of ecosystems, are the largest carbon reservoirs globally. Hydrological conditions, as the determining factors of wetland ecosystems, control the unique biological and chemical processes of wetlands and play a key role in the development, evolution, and maintenance of the structure and function of wetland ecosystems. For most wetlands, evapotranspiration is an important component of the wetland water cycle and the main mode of water loss. The latent heat flux corresponding to evapotranspiration is a major expenditure of energy in wetlands. It can be said that evapotranspiration significantly affects the water-heat balance of wetlands and has important impacts on wetland water levels, soil salinity, inundation area, and inundation duration, thus controlling the functioning of wetland ecosystems to some extent. Therefore, studying wetland evapotranspiration and its driving mechanisms is of great significance for understanding the structure, function, and characteristics of wetland ecosystems. Traditional observation methods for evapotranspiration are mainly conducted at sites or in fields, using hydrological and meteorological principles to measure or calculate crop evapotranspiration. However, conducting intensive observations over large areas is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. On the other hand, the spatial variability of parameters such as topography, vegetation, and soil makes it difficult to scale up single-point observation data. With the advent of remote sensing technology, visible light, near-infrared, and thermal infrared remote sensing bands can provide many parameters closely related to surface evapotranspiration and energy transfer processes. Remote sensing methods are suitable for both local and regional scales. The use of remote sensing technology for regional evapotranspiration estimation has been increasingly applied in recent years. Currently, remote sensing estimation of evapotranspiration includes statistical empirical methods, energy balance methods, numerical models, and all-remote sensing information models."

By employing the coupled TSEB model, the evapotranspiration of the Yellow River Delta wetland is inverted, which not only allows for the total daily evapotranspiration to be obtained but also enables the separate estimation of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation. This provides a theoretical basis for studying the ecological hydrological relationships of the Yellow River Delta wetland and for maintaining the balance of the wetland ecosystem."

This has resulted in serious ecological imbalances, such as the gradual shrinkage of freshwater wetland areas at the river mouth, increased soil salinization, and a decline in biodiversity."

Then, the TSEB model is utilized to separate soil and vegetation, calculating the instantaneous soil evaporation, vegetation transpiration, and total soil-vegetation evapotranspiration in the Yellow River Delta wetland. The integral relationship method is employed for time scale conversion to obtain daily evapotranspiration. The remotely sensed estimates are directly and indirectly evaluated for accuracy using the measured evaporation values from meteorological stations and the crop coefficient calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith formula."
