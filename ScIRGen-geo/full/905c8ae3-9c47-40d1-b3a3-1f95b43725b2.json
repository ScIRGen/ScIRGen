            "description": "We compiled the Seismotectonic Map and Seismic Hazard Zonation Map of Central Asia using the ArcGIS platform through data collecting and digitization. The seismotectonic map of Western Asia covers Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The seismotectonic map is replenished with tremendous amount published data and depicts the location, character and name  of the seismogenic faults or active faults and the epicenter of earthquakes with M ≥ 5 from 1960 to 2010. The zonation map shows the mean values of peak ground acceleration (PGA) with 10% probability of being exceeded in 50 years. The two maps can not only be used in the research of active faults and seismic risks in Central Asia, but also will be applied to the seismic safety evaluation for infrastructure construction.",

These maps encompass regions like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, illustrating the locations, activity, and names of seismogenic faults, as well as epicenters of earthquakes with magnitudes above 5 during the specified period. Additionally, the hazard zoning maps use the peak ground acceleration (PGA) with a 10% probability of exceedance in the next 50 years as an indicator to delineate seismic hazard zones. This information is crucial for studying active tectonics and earthquake disasters in Central Asia and ensuring seismic safety for large engineering and infrastructure projects in the region.",
