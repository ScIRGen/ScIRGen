            "description": "The permafrost stability map was created based on the classification system proposed by Guodong Cheng (1984), which mainly depended on the inter-annual variation of deep soil temperature. By using the geographical weighted regression method, many auxiliary data was fusion in the map, such as average soil temperature, snow cover days, GLASS LAI, soil texture and organic from SoilGrids250, soil moisture products from CLDAS of CMA, and FY2/EMSIP precipitation products. The permafrost stability data spatial resolution is 1km and represents the status around 2010. The following table is the permafrost stability classification system. The data format is Arcgis Raster.",

                    "Answer": "The 'geographical weighted regression method' refers to a statistical technique used to analyze spatially varying relationships. In the context of permafrost distribution mapping, it involves integrating various datasets, such as annual ground temperature data from boreholes, remote sensing snow cover days, leaf area index, soil texture components, soil organic matter, soil bulk density, and soil moisture products, to estimate and map permafrost stability at a high spatial resolution, specifically aimed at representing conditions of the 2010s decade.",

                    "Answer": "The use of geographic weighted regression in estimating permafrost stability distribution involves integrating annual mean ground temperature data from drilling sites with remote sensing data such as snow cover days, leaf area index, and soil properties. This method allows for spatial variations to be considered, which may offer different insights compared to other statistical modeling techniques that do not account for spatial heterogeneity.",

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves collecting year-round ground temperature data from 233 boreholes, along with remote sensing snow cover days, GLASS leaf area index, SoilGrids250m soil texture data (including sand, clay, and silt content), soil organic matter, and soil bulk density. Additionally, soil moisture products from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) and a fusion of data from nearly 40,000 regional automatic weather stations with FY2/EMSIP precipitation products are utilized. These datasets are then integrated using geographic weighted regression to estimate a 1km resolution map of permafrost stability for the 2010s.",
