            "description": "This data belongs to zircon U-Pb geochronology data of early Mesozoic strata in Yanshan tectonic belt, including Pb, 232Th, 238U contents, 207Pb / 206Pb, 207Pb / 235U, 206Pb / 238U ratios and errors, 207Pb / 235U, 206Pb / 238U ages and errors, etc. Zircon U-Pb dating was performed in the ion probe Laboratory of Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences using cameca ims-1280hr. The U-Th-Pb isotopic ratios were determined by standard zircon pl é Sovice correction was achieved. The U content was obtained by standard zircon 91500 correction. Simultaneous interpreting of the standard deviation and the internal accuracy of the single point test was achieved by the standard sample of long term monitoring, and the single point error was obtained. The accuracy of the standard sample Qinghu was used as the unknown sample monitoring data. The measured 204Pb value is used for ordinary Pb correction. The error of isotope ratio and age is 1 σ。 The harmonious age and average age were calculated by using the isoplot software. The results of geochronology data are published in Earth Science Reviews. The data quality is reliable. It plays an important role in establishing the early Cenozoic geochronology framework and regional stratigraphic correlation of Yanshan structural belt, and lays a foundation for further analysis of Mesozoic basin evolution history, which has a good application prospect.",

This method allows for precise dating of strata by analyzing the isotopes like Pb, Th, and U, and calculating ratios such as 207Pb/206Pb and 206Pb/238U. It is used to establish geochronological frameworks and facilitate regional stratigraphic comparisons.",

This approach enhances the precision of single-point errors and maintains internal accuracy, which is crucial for constructing the Early Mesozoic geochronological framework and facilitating regional stratigraphic correlations in the Yanshan tectonic belt. Consequently, this method significantly contributes to the understanding of the Mesozoic basin evolution history and has promising application prospects.",
