      "description": "Soil is the basis of human survival and development. Many United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly related to the utilization and management of soil resources. However, most of the existing soil information in the world and China comes from historical soil survey, which is coarse and out-of-date, and can not meet the needs of dealing with global and regional problems such as food security, water shortage, land degradation and climate change. China has a vast territory with complex and diverse soil landscape and strong human activities. The establishment of high-precision soil information grid is of great significance in scientific frontier breakthrough and has broad prospects in applications. Here, we adopted predictive soil mapping paradigm and developed adaptive depth function fitting method and integrated it with state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning in a high performance parallel computing environment to generate 90-m resolution national gridded maps of soil properties (soil organic carbon, pH value, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, cation exchange capacity, coarse fragments (> 2mm), sand, silt, clay, soil texture classes, bulk density, soil thickness, etc.) at multiple depths across China. Their uncertainty in soil predictions is also estimated in a spatial way. This was based on more than 5000 representative soil profile samples obtained from the \"project of National Soil Series Survey and Compilation of Soil Series of China\" in recent years and a suite of detailed covariates to characterize soil-forming environments using geographical information and remote sensing techniques. Compared with previous soil maps, we achieved significantly more detailed and accurate predictions which could well represent soil variations across the territory. This work has constructed China's first version of high-resolution National Soil Information Grids, which is also a significant contribution to the GlobalSoilMap.net project. It is expected to have a wide application prospect in the fields of soil resources, agriculture, hydrology, ecology, climate, environment and so on, such as soil monitoring and management, soil function evaluation, land surface process modelling and forensic soil evidence provenance.",

        "Soil texture is an important soil property that controls most physical, chemical and biological processes in soils. It can influence soil thermal capacity, permeability, water holding capacity and solute movement which are closely associated with applications of climate, ecological, hydrological modelling, smart agricultural management and soil pollution control. Currently, there is an increasing demand for detailed three-dimensional soil texture information in dealing with global and national issues such as climate change, soil degradation, water resource shortage, environmental pollution, agricultural and ecosystem sustainability. The GlobalSoilMap project was proposed in 2006 and officially launched in 2009. Its aim is to make a new digital soil map of the world using state-of-the-art technologies for soil mapping and predicting soil properties at a 90m resolution and six standard depth layers 0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100 and 100–200 cm.",
        "In addition, we found that heat, water, wind, and terrain were major controlling factors for the spatial patterns of soil texture in China. The heat and water have driven physical and chemical weathering and wind have driven erosion processes which have primarily shaped the pattern of clay content. The terrain, wind and water have driven deposition, erosion and transportation sorting processes of soil particles which have primarily shaped the pattern of silt. Heat-driven physical weathering and wind, water and terrain-driven erosion processes have primarily shaped the pattern of sand. The findings provide clues for developing mechanistic soil evolution models to simulate spatiotemporal evolution of soil texture at a national extent. The simulation can support national soil management to ensure the soil is secured in the future. This is particularly important under the background of increasing climate changes and intensified human activities.",
        "Chinahasalargespaningeographicalextent,coveringanareaof9.6 million km2. Its soil landscapes are very diverse and complex. It is a challenge to accurately predict soil spatial variations with a limited number of soil survey sites across the country. So far, high-resolution and three-dimensional predictive soil mapping at a national extent has not yet been attempted although there were some studies in watershed and field scales. Despite the efforts above, the gap between detailed and accurate soil data demands and availability is still large. Our understanding on soil variation over landscapes at horizontal and vertical dimensions is still limited. Meanwhile, current digital soil mapping methods are not perfect when applying them in large areas.",
        "Uncertainty representation is a crucial aspect of digital soil mapping (Arrouays et al., 2014). Digital soil mapping models are not only expected to deliver accurate soil predictions at a given location but their suitability to deliver maps should encompass the ability to predict how uncertain these predictions are (Vaysse and Lagacherie, 2017).",
        "Lagacherie and Voltz (2000) speculated that, especially over large areas, predictive capabilities are limited because relationships between soil properties and landscape attributes are nonlinear or unknown. Minasny and McBratney (2010) noted that knowledge and techniques for regional soil mapping may not be applicable at a global extent due to spatial variability of soil-landscape relationships. Mitran et al. (2018) found that geographically weighted regression kriging model had better predictive performance of surface total carbon stocks than linear regression kriging model in two adjacent states in southern India. Keskin et al. (2019) showed that random forest as ensemble method outperformed other relatively simple methods such as classification and regression trees for digital mapping of soil carbon fractions in Florida. In addition, although the model built in a large extent may be unbiased for the whole extent, its prediction is often biased in local areas. This problem may indicate that current soil prediction models are still not flexible enough to deal with the complexity of soil-landscape relationships in large extents. Arrouays et al. (2017) highlighted that both top-down and bottom-up approaches are necessary to enhance the quality of digital soil maps and map the entire world."

        "Therefore, the objective of the study was to conduct high-resolution and three-dimensional predictive mapping of soil texture across China, and to reveal the controlling environmental factors and processes for spatial pattern of soil texture at a national extent."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "The lack of detailed three-dimensional soil texture information largely restricts many applications in agriculture, hydrology, climate, ecology and environment. The wide range between 5% lower and 95% upper prediction limits may suggest that there was a substantial room to improve current predictions.",
        "Besides, new methodologies still need to be explored for large extent digital soil mapping, from which many global initiatives will greatly benefit.",
        "The soil profiles were originated from the Second National Soil Survey conducted three decades ago, which lacked of accurate georeference due to unavailable GPS system at that time. The northwestern and southwestern parts had obviously less soil profiles than other parts. The reason had two aspects: one was poor accessibility in the west and limited funding for the soil survey, and another was relatively small soil spatial variation in the northwest. The harsh environments and underdeveloped road networks lead to poor accessibility in the two parts.",
        "In addition, due to large mapping area and fine resolution, the amount of data and computation are quite large.",
        "The second change poses a challenge for current digital soil mapping methodologies. It would be helpful to explore more complicated (maybe also better) models but the computational challenge arising therefrom needs to be considered. This is not surprising but indeed a problem that needs to be addressed by digital soil mapping communities. This problem may indicate that current soil prediction models are still not flexible enough to deal with the complexity of soil-landscape relationships in large extents."

        "We used 4579 soil profiles collected from a national soil series inventory conducted recently and currently available environmental covariates. We constructed random forest models and employed a parallel computing strategy for the predictions of soil texture fractions based on its relationship with the environmental factors. Quantile regression forest was used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions.",
        "A total of 4579 soil profiles were used in this study. In laboratory, samples were air-dried at room temperature and then passed through a 2 mm sieve. Basic soil properties including soil texture, soil organic carbon, bulk density, pH, cation exchange capacity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, available phosphorus and available potassium were measured. Among them, soil texture fractions, namely sand (2–0.05 mm), silt (0.05–0.002 mm) and clay (<0.002 mm) percentages, were determined using the pipette method. Out of all soil profiles, 458 (10%) were randomly selected as random-held back evaluation samples. They were used for evaluating the results of this study through comparisons with existing traditional soil texture maps and the SoilGrids250 maps, and also evaluating the uncertainty estimation of soil texture predictions. The remaining 4121 (90%) were used for model training and 10-fold cross validation. For each profile of a soil texture fraction (sand, silt or clay percentages), we used equal-area quadratic splines to fit a continuous depth function to original horizon sample data. Based on the 4121 training soil profile sites, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, random forest, was used to model the relationships between each soil texture fraction (sand, silt or clay percentage) and the environmental covariates at each depth interval. The model training was performed separately for sand, silt and clay percentages and depth by depth.",
        "In this study, we made trials with three values of mtry: one third (default), one half and two third of the total number of covariates, but found that they had no obvious differences in the prediction accuracy. Then, with the spatially exhaustive environmental covariates, the trained random forest model of each soil texture fraction and depth interval was applied over space. The random forest modeling and mapping were implemented in the open source R environment (R Core Team, 2016) with the packages ‘randomForest’ (Liaw and Wiener, 2002), ‘quantregForest’ (Meinshausen and Schiesser, 2015), ‘rgdal’ (Keitt et al., 2009), ‘raster’ (Hijmans and van Etten, 2013), ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham et al., 2019), and ‘dismo’ (Hijmans et al., 2017). To improve computation efficiency, a parallel computing strategy was employed in data processing, which separated the whole area into many tiles and run multiple-thread parallel computation. We performed 30 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation and calculated their values of mean and standard deviation of the measurements."

Besides, we found that climate and terrain factors are major controllers for spatial patterns of soil texture in China.",
        "Overall, the mean CCC values ranged from 0.59 to 0.65, indicating good agreement between the predicted and observed values. The mean R2 values of the predictions of soil texture fractions at different depth intervals were between 0.43 and 0.50. Our predictions had much higher R2 values and lower RMSE values than these existing soil texture maps for all the depths. The differences in the R2 values indicate that the improvement for clay content was around 248% relative to the linkage maps and 92% relative to the SoilGrids250m maps respectively.",
        "The study shows that the combination of machine learning techniques with currently available high-resolution soil formative environmental covariates can effectively predict spatial variation of soil texture at a national extent and a detailed level. We provided the first version of 90 m resolution maps of soil texture fractions and their uncertainty across China. It was much more accurate and detailed than the existing soil texture maps and can well represent spatial variation of soil texture.
