Affected by the urgent need for soil information data around the world, especially in the context of the Climate Change Convention, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Kyoto Protocol for Soil Carbon Measurement and FAO/International The Global Agroecological Assessment Study (GAEZ v3.0) jointly established the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.2 (HWSD V1.2). Among them, the data source in China is the second national land in 1995. Investigate 1:1,000,000 soil data provided by Nanjing Soil. The resolution is 30 seconds (about 0.083 degrees, 1km).

                    "Answer": "In global soil databases like the Harmonized World Soil Database, soil texture and organic carbon content are determined using grid raster formats with data projections such as WGS84. The soil texture is specified for different layers, with the top layer (0-30cm) and bottom layer (30-100cm) having distinct attributes including gravel, sand, silt, and clay content in percentage by weight. Organic carbon content is also measured in these layers as a percentage of weight.",

                    "Answer": "The Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) is a comprehensive soil data set developed under the collaboration of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and other partners. It provides essential soil information at both global and local scales, which is crucial for assessing land degradation, conducting environmental impact studies, and implementing sustainable land management interventions. The database addresses the urgent need for reliable soil data worldwide, particularly in the context of climate change agreements like the Kyoto Protocol. The HWSD includes soil data from various sources, such as the 1995 National Land Survey of China, and is formatted in grid raster with WGS84 projection using FAO-90 classification systems.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in collecting reliable soil data at both global and local scales are primarily due to the lack of consistent and comprehensive soil information. This affects land degradation assessment, environmental impact studies, and sustainable land management interventions. The need for improved soil data is critical, especially in the context of international climate change agreements. The Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) addresses this need by integrating various global and regional soil databases, utilizing soil classification systems such as FAO-90, and providing detailed soil property fields across different soil depths.",

                    "Answer": "Developing a new generation of harmonized global soil databases is crucial due to the significant lack of reliable soil data that hinders land degradation assessments, environmental impact studies, and sustainable land management interventions at both global and local scales. The urgent need for soil information worldwide, particularly in the context of international climate change agreements, has driven international collaborations to create comprehensive datasets like the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), which aims to support better soil carbon measurement and agricultural ecological assessments.",
