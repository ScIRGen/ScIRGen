Water vapor isotopes (δ18Ov and δDv) were online measured during November 2012 to December 2018 by a Wavelength Scanned Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (WS-CRDS, model: Picarro L2120-i) at the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System of Nanjing University (SORPES-NJU, 32.12°N, 118.95°E, 55 m above sea level) on the Xianlin Campus of the Nanjing University, about 20 km east of downtown Nanjing in the Eastern China. The uncertainties were determined to be less than 0.2‰ for δ18Ov and 1.0‰ for δDv. Precipitation isotopes were also measured by Picarro L2120-i during September 2011 to December 2018, with the analytical uncertainty of less than 0.1‰ for δ18O and 0.5‰ for δD.",

        "There are about 1,200 lakes (>1 km2) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP; Zhang, Yao, Xie, Qin, et al., 2014), and many studies have shown that lake ice phenology (i.e., the timing of freezeup, breakup, and duration of ice cover) responds well to climatic and environmental changes (Brown & Duguay, 2010; Weber et al., 2016). As “the Third Pole of the Earth,” the TP is very sensitive to global climate change (Kang et al., 2010; Liu & Chen, 2000; Qiu, 2008). Changes in air and water surface temperatures related to climatic changes are important factors in the lake ice phenology changes (Adrian et al., 2009; Dörnhöfer & Oppelt, 2016; Yao et al., 2016; Zhang, Yao, Xie, Zhang, et al., 2014). At the same time, the state and type of lake ice and their change to open water system in turn affect the local or regional climate (Brown & Duguay, 2010; Rouse et al., 2005). However, due to the harsh environment and limited accessibility, few meteorological stations exist in the central and western TP where lakes are concentrated; thus, it is difficult to carry out field observations. The unique geographical and climatic conditions of the TP make it a region of high interest for climate research (Kang et al., 2010)."
      ],
      "research objective": [
        "To obtain the lake ice phenology variations on the TP, the daily snow products of MODIS are used to extract the freezeup and breakup dates of lake‐wide ice cover from 2001 to 2017. In addition, possible influence of geographical determined lake locations and physico‐chemical conditions on lake ice phenology are also investigated."

      "challenges": [
        "However, due to the harsh environment and limited accessibility, few meteorological stations exist in the central and western TP where lakes are concentrated; thus, it is difficult to carry out field observations. These factors result in a lack of continuous and complete historical records on regional climate changes."
      ],
      "methods": [
        "By analyzing the freezeup/breakup characteristics for each lake on the TP, 58 lakes with a stable ice cover period (less cloud cover, less pixel misclassification, and obvious ice cover period) are manually selected as study lakes. The data were obtained from the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (http://nsidc.org/; version 5 for 2001–2016 and version 6 for 2017) on 8 September 2017. To extract lake ice, pixels covering a lake need to be first distinguished from other types of pixels, such as cloud and land. A threshold of 0.4 for Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI; Hall et al., 2001) is applied to extract the extent of a lake. The cloud removal (gapfilling) process has two steps. The first step is to combine daily Terra and Aqua snow cover products to determine lake cover type. The second step is based on the temporal correlation of cloud cover pixels. First, if a pixel on date t is cloud covered, the pixels on the images of previous and next days will be searched, and if both pixels are covered by water, pixel on date t is determined to be covered by water."

The available temporal range of MOD10A1 is from 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2017 and that of MYD10A1 is from 1 August 2002 to 31 July 2017. Four MODIS tiles (h24v05, h25v05, h25v06, and h26v05) cover the 58 lakes of this study. The Landsat program is a series of Earth observing satellites, which is comanaged by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the United States Geological Survey to monitor Earth and environmental resources. Since 23 July 1972, eight satellites have been launched including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS; ~80 m) and Thematic Mapper (TM; 30 m)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+; 30 m)/Operational Land Imager (OLI; 30 m) with a temporal resolution of 16 days."
