The experimental instrument is multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC - ICP - MS), and the testing unit is Tianjin geological survey center of China Geological Survey. Some data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the obtained data, the variation law of zircon Hf isotopic composition in the study area can be found out, which can provide deterministic evidence for identifying the magmatic source area and specific magmatic process in the study area, and then provide new constraints on the Yanshanian tectonomagmatic evolution in the area.",

Laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry zircon U–pb dating results suggest that the rocks were erupted during the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (161–117 Ma). They belong to the high-K calc-alkaline series and can be divided into two groups. Group I rocks are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, contain low concentrations of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and high field strength elements (HFSEs), and have low zircon saturation temperatures (average 786 °C), all of which indicate an I-type affinity. In contrast, Group II rocks have higher HREE and HFSE concentrations and zircon saturation temperatures (average 918 °C), suggesting an A-type affinity. Our data indicate that the i-type felsic volcanic rocks formed from magmas generated by partial melting of a dominantly juvenile mica-bearing K-rich basaltic lower crust, whereas the A-type felsic volcanic rocks originated from the partial melting of a dry mafic–intermediate middle–lower crust that was dehydrated but not melt depleted."

These differences are linked to their formation from magmas generated by partial melting of different crustal compositions, with Group I from a juvenile mica-bearing K-rich basaltic lower crust and Group II from a dry mafic–intermediate middle–lower crust.",
