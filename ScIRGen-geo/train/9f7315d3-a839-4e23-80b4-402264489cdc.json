            "description": "This dataset contains stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of groundwater, river water, and lake water during the melting and freezing periods in the Qinghai Lake Basin（ δ 2H δ 18O δ 17O), hydrochemistry (pH, EC, TDS, TH, K, Ca, Mg, Na, HCO3), and mineral saturation index (SI) and other indicators. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes were tested using the LGR liquid water isotope analyzer. Water chemical ions are tested using portable multi-parameter instruments, plasma inductively coupled spectroscopy, on-site titration, and other methods. The mineral saturation index was calculated using Phreeqc Interactive software. The sample collection and testing process of this dataset strictly follows relevant experimental guidelines, and the data is reliable and accurate. This dataset can be used for quantitative research on water cycle and evolution laws, water quality, geochemical processes, etc. It is of great significance for the scientific management and sustainable development of regional water resources.",
