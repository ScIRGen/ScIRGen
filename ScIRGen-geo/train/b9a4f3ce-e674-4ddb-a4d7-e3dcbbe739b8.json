            "description": "The data set uses the multi disaster risk assessment model for livestock in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Ye et al. 2019) to simulate the livestock deaths caused by the comprehensive superposition impact of multiple disasters on livestock, such as winter snow disaster, strong wind, low temperature, high altitude hypoxia and summer drought, and evaluate the expected annual deaths. The data can provide information on the death risk of multi disaster livestock around the Himalayas and the Asian water tower area. The data comes from China Meteorological science data sharing service system cn05 1. National Qinghai Tibet Plateau data center, Qinghai Tibet Plateau multi-source remote sensing synthetic 1km snow cover data set (1995-2018), mod13q1.006 vegetation index data, SRTM 1 arc second global elevation data.",

This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the cumulative effects of various stressors like snow disasters, wind, low temperatures, high-altitude hypoxia, and summer droughts on livestock. It can refine the model simulations and offer more precise evaluations of the expected annual mortality rates.",

These datasets are used in a comprehensive livestock multi-hazard risk assessment model, as described by Ye et al. 2019, to simulate the cumulative impact of winter snowstorms, strong winds, low temperatures, high-altitude hypoxia, and summer droughts on livestock mortality and evaluate the annual expected mortality in the region surrounding the Himalayas and the Asian Water Tower area.",
