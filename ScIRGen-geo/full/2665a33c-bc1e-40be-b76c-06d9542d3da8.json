            "description": "The data are Re Os isotopic geochronological data of pyrites from Shangbao pyrite fluorite deposit in southeastern Hunan, South China. The Os isotopic data were obtained by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Re content was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The formation age of the Shangbao pyrite fluorite deposit in southeastern Hunan can be determined by the data obtained. The isochron age of six euhedral pyrite grains in one sample is 279 ±  At 12 Ma, the initial 187Os / 188Os ratio was 0.39 ±  The concentrations of RE and OS were 0.12-63.5 ppb and 2.14-185 PPT, respectively. The age of the early Permian is consistent with that of the host strata of pyrite. The isochron age of five euhedral pyrite grains in the other sample is 75.2 ±  3 Ma, initial 187Os / 188Os ratio 0. 141 ±  The concentrations of RE and OS were 0.15-0.43 ppb and 1.0-39.9 PPT, respectively. If one pyrite particle with the highest 187Re / 188Os and 187Os / 188Os is excluded, the isochronal age of the other four pyrite particles is 85 ±  13Ma。 This is consistent with the zircon U-Pb age of the Shangpu granite (80. 1 1 ±  3 MA).",

This data helps define the formation age of mineral deposits, such as the pyrite-fluorite deposits in southern Hunan, Southeast China.",

                    "Question": "What are the underlying causes for the variance in Re-Os isotopic age determinations in pyrite samples from mineral deposits, and how do these factors influence the accuracy of age estimation?",
                    "Answer": "The variance in Re-Os isotopic age determinations in pyrite samples can be attributed to several factors including the initial 187Os/188Os ratio, the Re and Os concentration levels, and the presence of outlier samples with extreme 187Re/188Os and 187Os/188Os ratios. These factors influence the accuracy of age estimation by potentially skewing the isochron age results. For example, excluding a pyrite particle with a high 187Re/188Os ratio can lead to a more consistent isochron age that aligns better with other geological dating methods, such as zircon U-Pb dating.",

                    "Question": "What are the consequences of using Re-Os isotope data from multiple pyrite samples for determining the formation age of mineral deposits?",
                    "Answer": "The use of Re-Os isotope data from multiple pyrite samples allows for the determination of isochron ages, which can provide a precise age for the formation of mineral deposits. For instance, in the field described, the isochron age of 279±12 Ma for one sample and 75.2±4.3 Ma for another sample help to corroborate the age of the host strata and associated granite, thus refining the geological timeline of the region.",
