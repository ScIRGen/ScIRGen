            "description": "The data set contains the magnetism, grain size, geochemical element, chromaticity and organic carbon isotope data of 119 topsoils in the middle and upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, southern Tibetan Plateau; contains the age, magnetism, grain size, geochemical element, chromaticity and organic carbon isotope data of the five aeolian sedimentary sections in this region; and contains chronological data of 36 aeolian sediments, provenance data of 46 samples from different sediments, and Sr-Nd isotopic data of 21 samples from different sediments. The magnetic susceptibility was measured using a Bartington MS2 metre with a dual-frequency sensor; The anhysteretic remanent magnetization was induced by LDA-5 demagnetizer, and was measured using a JR-6A Minispin magnetometer; The grain size was measured by Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser particle size analyzer; The geochemical element was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer; The chromaticity was measured by CM-700d spectrophotometer; The organic carbon isotope was determined by element analyzer-stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS); Optically stimulated luminescence measurements were conducted using an automated Ris√∏-TL/OSL-DA-20 reader; For the AMS14C and Sr-Nd isotope measurements, please refer to the main body of the scientific research report. The data set is rich in information, authentic and reliable, and provides an important data reference for understanding the physical and chemical properties of surface dust, provenance, and the long-term evolution history of ancient dust in Yarlung Zangbo River basin, southern Tibetan Plateau.
