            "description": "Data source and content: In 2015, China's urban and rural elderly population sampling survey was a nationwide cross-sectional survey covering 224142 elderly people aged 60 years and above in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities directly under the Central Government in Chinese Mainland. We use the frailty index for frailty and pre frailty assessments, and the diagnosis of asthma in the elderly is self-reported based on the doctor's diagnostic history.\n\nData processing method: The missing situation of each observation variable in the same group: Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple filling method to fill in the missing data; Build FI index: Build FI according to Searle's standard procedure. FI score ≥ 0.25 represents weakness,<0.12 represents robustness, and FI score 0.12-0.25 represents pre weakness.\n\nExplore and describe the distribution of observed variables, test the differences in baseline covariates under various grouping situations, compare two or more variable groups: use independent sample t-test for continuous variables, and use categorical variables χ 2 Inspection. The Cochran Armitage test is used to test the linear trend of covariate prevalence. Multivariate logistic regression: analysis of influencing factors related to frailty and pre frailty\n\nData analysis results: 9416 elderly people with asthma were included in the study. Among elderly Chinese people with asthma, the age gender standardized prevalence rates of frailty and pre frailty are 35.8% (95% CI 34.8% -36.7%) and 54.5% (95% CI 53.5% -55.5%). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that increasing age, female gender, illiteracy, living alone, poor economic status, ADL disability, comorbidity, hospitalization in the past year, and living in northern China were associated with frailty and pre frailty in elderly asthma patients.\n\nConclusion: Among elderly asthma patients in China, the prevalence of frailty and pre frailty is very high, and the assessment of frailty should become a routine treatment for elderly asthma patients. Appropriate public health prevention strategies should be developed based on the identified risk factors for frailty in elderly asthma patients, in order to reduce the burden of frailty in Chinese elderly asthma patients.",

                "Asthma is a common non-communicable lung disease, with an aging population, the number of older people suffering from asthma is increasing. Epidemiological data show that the prevalence of asthma in people aged 65 years or over is 4%−15%. The 2017 global burden of disease study revealed asthma to be the second most prevalent chronic respiratory disease after chronic obstructive respiratory disease and the second leading cause of death from chronic respiratory disease. Asthma poses a serious threat to the quality of life and health of older people, and increases the use and burden of healthcare resources on society. Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterized by reduced physiological reserve and multisystem dysregulation, which limits the body’s ability to respond to internal and external stresses and maintain the stability of the internal environment, increasing the body’s susceptibility to stressful events. The weighted prevalence of frailty in older people in the community is 11% (range 4%−59%). Frail older people are at significantly increased risk of falls, delirium, incapacity, hospitalization and death, and increase the burden on society’s healthcare resources. There are few large-scale studies in the world on frailty in older adults with asthma. The paucity of research on frailty in older patients with asthma has led to many challenges in the comprehensive management of asthma in older adults."

                    "Answer": "The data in the field of frailty among older adults with asthma were collected using a nationwide cross-sectional survey. The frailty and pre-frailty assessments were performed using a frailty index, and the diagnosis of asthma was self-reported based on the history of the physician’s diagnosis. Missing data were filled using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation method to ensure accuracy and reliability.",

                    "Answer": "The frailty index is utilized to perform frailty and pre-frailty assessments in large-scale epidemiological studies, allowing for standardized and systematic evaluation of frailty among older adults. This index helps categorize individuals into frail, pre-frail, and robust groups based on specific scoring criteria, thus facilitating the assessment process.",

                    "Answer": "The use of the frailty index in a large-scale cross-sectional study, such as the one involving 224,142 older adults in China, is effective for systematically assessing frailty and pre-frailty. It allows for standardized evaluation across a diverse population, providing valuable epidemiological insights and facilitating comparisons of frailty status among subgroups, which is crucial in understanding the burden of frailty in older adults with asthma.",

                    "Answer": "Using self-reported data based on a physician's diagnosis might introduce recall bias and accuracy issues, as older adults may misremember or misunderstand their diagnosis. This method relies on the participants' ability to accurately report their medical history, which could be compromised by cognitive decline in older adults, potentially affecting the reliability of asthma prevalence assessments.",

                    "Answer": "To enhance data completeness, employing techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation, as done in the study, is effective. This method helps manage missing data by generating plausible values based on observed data patterns. Additionally, minimizing missing data through robust survey design and comprehensive follow-up protocols can further enhance data integrity and reliability in large-scale epidemiological studies.",

Such surveys can utilize self-reported data on physician-diagnosed asthma and assess frailty using indices like the frailty index.",
