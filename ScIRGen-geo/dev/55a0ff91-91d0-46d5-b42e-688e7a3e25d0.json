            "description": "This data is the major and trace data of whole rock, zircon U-Pb isotopic dating data and zircon Lu Hf isotopic data of diabase samples from the southwestern Yangtze plate, South China. Zircon U-Pb dating and trace elements were analyzed by la-icp-ms. in situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the data obtained, the Archean basement can be studied, and the relationship between the formation of tectonic minerals and the evolution of the Columbia supercontinent in the late Paleoproterozoic Mesoproterozoic evolution of the southwest Yangtze plate is discussed.",
