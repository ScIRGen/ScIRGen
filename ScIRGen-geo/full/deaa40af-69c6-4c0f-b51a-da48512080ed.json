            "description": "Based on the data of 21 regular meteorological observation stations in Heihe River Basin and its surrounding areas and 13 national benchmark stations around Heihe River provided by the data management center of Heihe plan, the daily sunshine hours are statistically sorted out and the monthly sunshine hours data of 1961-2010 for many years are calculated. The spatial stability analysis is carried out to calculate the variation coefficient. If the variation coefficient is greater than 100%, the geographical weighted regression is used to calculate the relationship between the station and the geographical terrain factors, and the monthly sunshine hours distribution trend is obtained; if the variation coefficient is less than or equal to 100%, the ordinary least square regression is used to calculate the sunshine hours and the geographical terrain factors (longitude, latitude, elevation, slope, aspect, etc.) of the station ï¼‰The distribution trend of sunshine hours per month is obtained, and the residuals after removing the trend are fitted and corrected by HASM (high accuracy surface modeling method). Finally, the monthly average sunshine hours distribution of the Heihe River Basin in 1961-2010 is obtained by adding the trend surface results and the residual correction results. Time resolution: monthly average sunshine hours for many years from 1961 to 2010. Spatial resolution: 500M.",

                    "Answer": "Spatial stationarity analysis refers to the examination of how consistent or variable data is across different spatial locations. In the context of meteorological data collection for the Heihe River Basin, it involves calculating the coefficient of variation for monthly sunshine duration at each observation station. If the coefficient exceeds 100%, a geographical weighted regression is used to model the relationship between station data and geographical factors. If it is 100% or less, ordinary least squares regression is applied to understand this relationship.",

                    "Answer": "The variation in monthly sunshine duration data can be interpreted by analyzing the spatial stability of the data using the coefficient of variation. If the variation is greater than 100%, geographical weighted regression is used to establish the relationship between station data and geographical features, indicating a distribution trend. If the variation is less than or equal to 100%, ordinary least squares regression is used to correlate sunshine duration with geographical and topographical factors such as latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, and aspect. These analyses help infer how geographical and topographical influences impact sunshine duration over the years.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of regression method depends on the variability of the data. If the coefficient of variation of the sunshine duration data is greater than 100%, a geographically weighted regression is used to account for the relationship between the site data and geographical and topographical factors. If the coefficient of variation is 100% or less, an ordinary least squares regression is employed to model the relationship between the site sunshine duration values and geographical and topographical factors.",

                    "Question": "What are the potential impacts on the spatial accuracy and reliability of sunshine duration distribution trends when employing geographic weighted regression versus ordinary least squares regression methods in data collection for meteorological observations?",
                    "Answer": "The spatial accuracy and reliability of sunshine duration distribution trends could vary significantly depending on the regression method: if the coefficient of variation is greater than 100%, geographic weighted regression is used, which accounts for the relationship between station data and geographic terrain factors to obtain monthly sunshine duration distribution trends. This method may enhance spatial accuracy by considering spatial heterogeneity. Conversely, when the coefficient of variation is less than or equal to 100%, ordinary least squares regression is used, which provides a straightforward relationship between station sunshine duration values and geographic factors, potentially resulting in more general trends. The choice of method thus can affect how accurately the distribution trends represent actual geographic variations in sunshine duration across the Heihe River Basin.",

                    "Answer": "The use of spatial station data from meteorological observation sites and national benchmark stations, alongside spatial stability analysis, enables accurate analysis. If the coefficient of variation is high, geographic weighted regression is used to assess the relationship between site data and geographical factors. Otherwise, ordinary least squares regression is applied. High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method (HASM) is used for residual fitting and correction, which, when combined with trend surface results, provides detailed spatial distribution insights.",
