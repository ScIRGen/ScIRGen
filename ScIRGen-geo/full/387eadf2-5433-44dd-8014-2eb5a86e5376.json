            "description": "This data is EPMA data of chlorite from Jingchong co Cu polymetallic deposit in Hunan Province. The experimental method is EPMA. The test was completed in the Key Laboratory of nonferrous metal metallogenic prediction, Ministry of education, Central South University. The analytical instrument is Shimadzu epma-1720 electron probe equipped with four channel spectrometer and energy spectrometer. The experimental conditions are: accelerating voltage 20 kV, beam current 15 Na, beam spot diameter 1 μ m. ZAF correction method. The standard samples used for EPMA analysis of chlorite are apatite (P), rutile (TI), jadeite (al, Na), almandine (FE), rosapyroxene (MN), olivine (mg), diopside (CA, SI) and potash feldspar (k). This data can provide data support for future geochemical model analysis of Jingchong co Cu polymetallic deposit in Hunan Province.\nThe above data have been published in EI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored in Excel.",
            "instructions": "The EPMA data are stored in Excel format. \"Chl Ⅰ (zjc-6)\" in the excel header represents the chlorite generation and sample number respectively. The data point number format is \"q1-07\", where a-cc is the number and Q is the constant.",
