                "Land evapotranspiration (ET) is a vital process in a global climate system that links water, carbon, and energy exchanges. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), the world’s highest and largest plateau, as a geomorphologic unit on the Eurasian continent, plays a crucial role in shaping Asian climate by heating the atmosphere over TP during spring and summer. However, with the impacts of global warming and human activities, the TP has been experiencing variations, both in regional climate such as drying and warming and in environmental changes including grassland degeneration, retreating of permafrost and glacier. Significant warming has resulted in extensive degradation of permafrost. Analysis on observations indicated that the warming rate over the TP exceeds that over the Northern Hemisphere and the same latitudinal zone in the same period. Several studies have focused on the variations of ET on the TP, which includes reference evapotranspiration ET ref, potential evapotranspiration ETp, pan evaporation ETpan, and actual evapotranspiration ETa, which is the amount of water evaporated by evaporation from water and soil surfaces and transpired by the plants to the atmosphere. As the ‘real’ term that evaporates water from water and soil and transpires water from the vegetation, ETa is the most important item that we concern about. Recent study on the global ETa indicated that an increasing soil-moisture limitation is the dominant contributor for the recent decline of ETa. While all TP climate zones experienced rapid warming and wetting, ETa on the TP is still less investigated."
