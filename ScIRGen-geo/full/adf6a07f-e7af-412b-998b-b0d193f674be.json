The process involves identifying relevant literature to extract data points such as observation years, geographic coordinates, ecosystem types, annual precipitation, drought index, net primary productivity, and biomass measurements. Field sampling includes collecting similar data points using standardized methods to ensure consistency with historical data. The integration process requires careful validation and calibration to maintain the dataset's completeness and precision, enabling accurate estimations of carbon storage in grassland vegetation.",

The resources that enable this include access to historical documents, the ability to conduct extensive field campaigns, and the use of various ecological and meteorological measurements such as ecosystem type, annual rainfall, drought index, net primary productivity, aboveground and belowground biomass.",
