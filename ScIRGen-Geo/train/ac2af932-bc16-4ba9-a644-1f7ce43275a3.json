      "description": "This data set mainly includes the results of Mg and Zn isotopic analysis of basalt samples from eastern China. The sampling sites include Nanjing, Shaoxing, Ningde, Sanming, Zhangzhou, etc. the samples are from Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic. It mainly includes the analysis of major / trace elements and Sr nd mg Zn isotopes. The instruments used include XRF, ICP-MS and MC-ICPMS. The major elements were obtained by XRF. The samples were digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin. Then, the isotopes of Sr, Nd, Mg and Zn were measured by MC-ICPMS. The international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. The test was completed from 2018-01-31 to 2020-05-31. The obtained data provide important information for the mg Zn isotopic composition of mantle derived magmatic rocks.",
