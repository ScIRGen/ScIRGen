            "description": "The data set of lake dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau was mainly derived from Landsat remote sensing data. Band ratio and the threshold segmentation method were applied. The temporal coverage of the data set was from 1984 to 2016, with a temporal resolution of 5 years. It covered the whole Tibetan Plateau at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The water body area extraction method mainly adopted the band ratio (B4/B2) or water body index to construct the classification tree. The algorithm construction considered the spatial and temporal variations of the spectral characteristics of the water body and adjusted the threshold of the decision tree by the slope and the slope aspect information of the water body. The long-term sequence satellite-borne data came from different sensors, e.g., Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI. The minimum unit for extracting water body information was 2*2 pixels, and all water body areas less than 0.36*10^-2 Km² were removed. The water body information extracted by high-resolution remote sensing data and the verification of the water body checkpoint determined by visual interpretation indicated that the overall accuracy of the water body area information for the Tibetan Plateau was above 95%. The data were saved as a shape file, and projected by Albers projection, with a central meridian of 105 ° and a double standard latitude of 25 ° and 47 °.",

                "Lake water surface temperature (LWST) has been regarded as a critical parameter in controlling functioning processes in aquatic ecosystems, e.g., physical, chemical and biological processes, and serious ecological consequences may be caused by lake warming. As demonstrated by some of the large lakes across the world show obviously increasing temperature as a result of climate change. Conventional approaches to measurement of lake water temperature use in situ data loggers to measure LWST. While such measured information is temporally continuous, its application for capturing temperature variations at large scale is constrained because of its limited spatial coverage. Lake water temperature is mainly influenced by the absorption of solar energy, which depends on an array of physical, chemical, and, to some extent, biotic properties of waters being concerned. Known as the world “Third Pole” and the “Asian Water Tower”, the Tibetan Plateau has experienced obvious climatic change in the past several decades. Thousands of closed lakes have developed on the Tibetan Plateau, and the total area is approximately half of the lake area in China, and most of which is sensitive to global warming. Mainly fed with snow and glacier melting waters, some closed lakes are experiencing expansion in summer and autumn, which is more obvious when lakes are supplemented with glacier melting waters."

The MODIS Reprojection Tool (MRT, Land Processes DAAC, 2008) was used to extract 8-day composite LST data from 5 grid tiles and to cover the Tibetan Plateau. The MODIS products with quasi-concurrent field survey were validated with direct temperature measurements over lakes collected in 2014 and 2015. In addition, the reliability of MODIS LST was also validated via comparing MODIS LST time series values with ground surface temperature (GST) at 0 cm measured over five weather stations distributed across the Tibetan Plateau."

Overall, a LWST trend cannot be detected for the 56 lakes in the plateau over the past 15 years. However, 38 (68%) lakes show a temperature decrease trend with a mean rate of −0.06 ◦C/year, and 18 (32%) lakes show a warming rate of (0.04 ◦C/year) based on daytime MODIS measurements. With respect to nighttime measurements, 27 (48%) lakes demonstrate a temperature increase with a mean rate of 0.051 ◦C/year, and 29 (52%) lakes exhibit a temperature decrease trend with a mean rate of −0.062 ◦C/year. This investigation indicates that lake depth and area (volume), attitude, geographical location and water supply sources affect the spatiotemporal variations of LWST across the Tibetan Plateau."
