Lake ice is an indicator of changes in lake environments; moreover, it is also one of the key Environmental Climate Variables (ECVs) in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). However, the existing in situ lake ice observation data for the Tibetan Plateau is severely limited due to the remoteness, harsh eco-environmental conditions, and thin atmosphere in this region. At present, many researchers have studied the lake ice phenology based on remote sensing data and released four data sets, but the dataset derived primarily from coarse resolution passive microwave observations is not effective for monitoring the numerous small lakes in the Tibetan Plateau."

This method was used to calculate and classify the daily lake ice characteristics for the maximum number of lakes within the Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2018."

Based on the complementary morning and afternoon satellite observations, daily lake ice/water data under cloud cover conditions was synthesized based on the following three rules. The cloud-covered pixels were re-identified using spatial adjacent relationships and its spatial continuity based on their proximity. Aiming to obtain the inventory of lake ice/water change characteristics for every single lake, a further time series filter was conducted for each lake with ice, water, and cloud."
