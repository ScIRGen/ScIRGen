            "description": "The cmip6 climate model data within the Qinghai Tibet plateau after downscaling and error correction includes three elements: daily precipitation, daily maximum and minimum surface temperatures, and covers the simulation results of ssp126, ssp245, ssp370 and ssp585 in the historical period (1979-2013) and future (2015-2100) of the climate model. The data is in NetCDF format, with a temporal resolution of 1 day and a horizontal spatial resolution of 0.1 °. It can provide support for the research and assessment of climate change in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.\nThe data set is based on seven cmip6 climate models such as access-esm1-5, which are publicly available in the world. Anu spline statistical interpolation downscaling is used, Bayesian model average multi model ensemble forecasting is used, and cncdfm (improved quantile chart method) method is used to correct the historical period and future prediction results of the model. The detailed process can be found in the references. The historical observation data are from two high-resolution historical meteorological data sets, CMFD and GPQM. After correction, the mean deviation of precipitation is less than 0.2mm/d, and the mean deviation of temperature is less than 0.97 ℃, which is much better than the original model.",

                    "Answer": "Downscaling in climate model data refers to the process of refining coarse-resolution climate model outputs to a finer spatial resolution to better represent local climates. In climate change research on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, downscaling is applied using ANU-Spline statistical interpolation, which helps in creating high-resolution datasets. This process involves correcting historical and future model predictions using methods like Bayesian model averaging and an improved quantile mapping technique called CNCDFm, which adjusts model outputs to align more closely with observed data.",

These methods result in a precipitation mean bias of less than 0.2mm/d and a temperature mean bias of less than 0.97°C, showing significant improvement over original model results.",

This dataset supports climate change research and evaluation in the region by offering improved historical and future climate predictions with reduced biases, which are critical for understanding regional climate dynamics and assessing potential impacts.",

Additionally, these models are processed using a Bayesian model averaging approach for multi-model ensemble forecasting. For error correction, the CNCDFm (improved quantile mapping method) is applied to both historical and future model predictions. This process uses high-resolution historical meteorological data from CMFD and GPQM datasets for calibration. The corrections result in a mean precipitation bias of less than 0.2mm/d and a temperature mean bias of less than 0.97℃, significantly improving the original model outputs.",
