            "description": "The data set includes major and trace elements, zircon U-Pb isotope, mineral chemistry and Hf isotope geochemical data of the whole rock from Lhasa block to cuomaixiang magmatic rock in Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The sampling time is 2015-2016, and the area is qanu area, gongcuomai Township, Gangdese, Tibet. The rock samples include 13 diorite and 14 gabbro. This data provides a key limit for understanding the initial subduction time of the Neotethys ocean, and limits the initial subduction time of the Neotethys ocean to 255-214 Ma, which is of great significance for exploring the tectonic evolution of the Tethys. The major and trace elements in the whole rock samples were measured by fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), zircon U-Pb dating by laser ablation plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), mineral chemistry by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and zircon in-situ Hf isotope by multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC – ICP – MS), The testing units include the State Key Laboratory of metallogenic mechanism of endogenetic metal deposits in Nanjing University and the Key Laboratory of deep geodynamics, Ministry of natural resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The data set has been published in the well-known Journal International geology review, and the data results are true and reliable.",
