            "description": "This dataset is the snow cover dataset based on the MODIS fractional snow cover mapping algorithm Coupled Regional Approach (CRA). The CRA algorithm mainly consists of three parts. (1) First, the N-FINDR (Volume Iterative Approach) and OSP (Orthogonal Subspace Projection) are used to automatically extract the endmember according to the settings (extracting 30 end endmembers). (2) On the basis of automatic extraction, combined with the IGBG land cover type map, six types of endmembers of snow, vegetation, cloud, soil, rock and water are selected by the manual screening method, and an annual spectrum database is established according to the 2009 image. There are 3 spectra in the early, middle and late months and 36 spectra a year. (3) The established spectral database is used as a priori knowledge, and based on prior knowledge, the fully constrained linear unmixing method (FCLS) for subpixel decomposition is used to obtain the fractional snow cover products. The NDSI ratio algorithm with improved topographic effect is used to obtain the snow cover area, the spatiotemporal data are then interpolated, and, finally, the multisource data fusion with the AMSR-E microwave snow depth product is undertaken.\nThe dataset adopts a latitude and longitude (Geographic) projection method. The datum is WGS84, and the spatial resolution is 0.005°. It provides the daily cloudless snow cover area map of the Tibetan Plateau from 2008 to 2010. The data set is stored by year and consists of 3 folders from 2008 to 2010. Each folder contains the classification results of the daily snow cover of the current year. It is a tif file with the naming rule YYYY***.tif, in which YYYY represents the year (2008-2010), and *** represents the day (001~365/ 366). It can be opened directly with ARCGIS or ENVI.",

                    "Answer": "The 'Coupled Regional Approach (CRA)' is a snow cover data collection algorithm based on MODIS snow area proportion mapping. It involves three main parts: automatic extraction of endmembers using N-FINDR and OSP methods, selection of six types of endmembers through manual screening combined with IGBG land cover type maps, and establishment of an annual spectral database. This database consists of three spectra per month, resulting in 36 spectra per year. The spectral database serves as prior knowledge for performing sub-pixel decomposition using the Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS) method to obtain primary snow area proportion products. Additionally, it includes the use of an improved NDSI ratio algorithm to account for topographic influence and subsequent spatiotemporal interpolation of data, culminating in the integration with AMSR-E microwave snow depth products for multi-source data fusion.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of multiple data sources and the use of the Coupled Regional Approach (CRA) suggests that accurately mapping snow cover in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau involves challenges related to the complexity of the landscape and the need for high-resolution data. The CRA algorithm addresses these challenges by incorporating endmember extraction, land cover type integration, spectral database creation, and linear spectral unmixing to produce a reliable snow cover dataset. Additionally, the use of improved NDSI ratio algorithms and data fusion with microwave snow depth products indicates the necessity of overcoming issues related to cloud cover, spectral variability, and terrain influence.",

This allows for the selection of specific types of endmembers such as snow, vegetation, and others. Additionally, it uses a spectral database built from 2009 imagery and applies fully constrained linear unmixing (FCLS) to decompose sub-pixel snow area proportions.

                    "Answer": "To generate snow cover datasets in high-altitude regions like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a multi-source fusion algorithm called the Coupled Regional Approach (CRA) is used. This involves three main steps: first, automatic extraction of endmembers using N-FINDR and OSP methods, followed by manual selection of six types of endmembers (snow, vegetation, cloud, soil, rock, and water) based on IGGB land cover type maps. A spectral database is established using 2009 images, consisting of 36 spectra for different periods of the year. The Fully Constrained Linear Spectral Unmixing (FCLS) method is then applied to decompose sub-pixels and obtain initial snow area proportion products. An improved NDSI ratio algorithm is used to adjust for terrain effects and calculate snow areas. Finally, spatial-temporal data interpolation is performed, and the results are integrated with AMSR-E microwave snow depth products to achieve multi-source data fusion. The accuracy of these fused datasets is verified through these rigorous methodologies and data integration techniques.",
