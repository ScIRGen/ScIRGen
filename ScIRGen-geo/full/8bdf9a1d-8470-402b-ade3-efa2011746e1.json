                    "Answer": "The 2012 input-output tables for the 11 districts and counties of the Heihe River Basin provide insights into the regional economic dependencies and interactions. By analyzing these tables, one can infer the economic strengths, weaknesses, and interconnectivity of different sectors within the region. This understanding could highlight areas where data collection methodologies might need to evolve to capture changes in economic activities or shifts in industrial focus. Additionally, these patterns could guide the development of future datasets to better inform policy-making, resource allocation, and regional planning efforts.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating a dataset of input-output tables from different districts within the Heihe River Basin can lead to more accurate regional economic planning by providing a comprehensive view of inter-district economic interactions and dependencies. It might help identify key sectors driving economic growth and optimize resource allocation across districts. Additionally, it could reveal potential disparities or complementarities between regions, informing targeted policy interventions for balanced development.",
