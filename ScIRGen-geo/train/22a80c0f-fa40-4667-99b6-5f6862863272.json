            "description": "The three pole soil microbial post-treatment products in typical years collected the distribution and analysis results of soil samples from the north and south polar regions from 2005 to 2006 and the distribution and analysis results of soil samples from the Qinghai Tibet Plateau in 2015. Through sorting and summarizing, the post-processing data products of soil microorganisms in the three pole region are obtained. The data format is excel, which is convenient for users to view. Among them, the collection time of samples from the north and south polar regions was from December 13, 2005 to December 8, 2006, including 52 samples from three regions in the Arctic (Spitsbergen slijeringa, Spitsbergen vestpynten, and Alexandra fjord Highlands), and 171 samples from five regions in the Antarctic (Mitchell Peninsula, Casey station main power house, Robinson ridge, herring Island, browning Peninsula); The Qinghai Tibet Plateau was collected from July 1 to July 15, 2015, including meadow, grassland and desert ecosystems. There were 18 sampling points in total, and the number of samples at each sampling point was 3-5. The precipitation, air temperature and drought degree of the sampling point are estimated from the meteorological information for reference. The soil surface samples were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen, then transported back to the Sydney Laboratory for extraction by fastprep DNA kit. The extracted DNA samples were amplified with the 16S rRNA gene fragment using 27F (5'-gagttttgatcntggctca-3') and 519r (5'-gtnttacngcgckctg-3'). The amplified fragments were sequenced by 454 method, and the original data were analyzed by mothur software. The sequences with poor sequencing quality were first removed, and then the chimeric sequences were sequenced and removed. After that, the similarity between sequences is calculated. Sequences with a similarity of more than 97% are clustered into one OTU, and OTU representative sequences are defined. The OTU representative sequences were aligned with the Silva database, and were identified to belong to the first level when the reliability was greater than 80%.",

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves sampling soil from various regions, such as the Arctic, Antarctic, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Samples are collected from specified locations and times, including the Arctic from December 2005 to December 2006 and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in July 2015. The soil surface samples are preserved with liquid nitrogen and transported to a laboratory for DNA extraction using a FastPrep DNA kit. The extracted DNA is amplified for the 16S rRNA gene fragment using specific primers and sequenced using the 454 sequencing method. The raw data undergoes quality filtering, sequence sorting, and chimera removal using Mothur software, followed by clustering sequences with over 97% similarity into OTUs. OTU representative sequences are identified against the Silva database with reliability greater than 80% to classify to the genus level.",

                    "Answer": "In polar regions, soil samples were collected between December 2005 and December 2006, with specific sites in the Arctic and Antarctic. These samples were preserved using liquid nitrogen and later transported to a lab for analysis. In contrast, the Tibetan Plateau samples were collected in July 2015, encompassing various ecosystems like meadows, grasslands, and deserts. Both regions used similar DNA extraction techniques with the FastPrep DNA kit, and the 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified using the same primers. However, the environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation differed significantly, with polar regions experiencing extreme cold and the Tibetan Plateau having variable precipitation and temperature, as estimated by meteorological data.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of sampling locations and times for soil samples in extreme environments such as polar regions and the Tibetan Plateau is influenced by factors including the specific ecological systems present (such as meadows, grasslands, and deserts on the Tibetan Plateau), the logistical feasibility of accessing those locations, and the need to cover a diverse range of environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Additionally, the timing of sample collection is often aligned with specific environmental conditions that could affect microbial communities, as seen in the sampling periods from December 2005 to December 2006 for polar regions and July 2015 for the Tibetan Plateau.",

The extracted DNA undergoes amplification of the 16S rRNA gene fragments using primers 27F and 519R. The amplified fragments are sequenced using the 454 sequencing method. The raw sequencing data is analyzed using Mothur software, where sequences of poor quality are removed, followed by sorting and chimera removal. Sequences with more than 97% similarity are clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and representative OTU sequences are identified by aligning with the Silva database, achieving genus-level identification with reliability greater than 80%.",
