            "description": "The recent glacial changes in the third polar region have become the focus of the governments of the surrounding countries because of their important significance to the downstream water supply. Based on SRTM acquired in 2000 and aster stereo image pairs before and after 2015, more than 40 Typical Glaciers in the third polar region were selected to estimate the glacial surface elevation in corresponding period. This product estimates the surface elevation changes of more than 14000 glaciers in the third polar region in 2000-2015s, and the investigated area accounts for about 25% of the total glaciers in the third polar region. The data covers the whole third pole area except Altai mountain, with a spatial resolution of 30m.",
