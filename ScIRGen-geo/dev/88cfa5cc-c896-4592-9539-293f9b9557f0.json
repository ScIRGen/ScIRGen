            "description": "The data are the radioisotope dating data of magmatic and metamorphic rocks, the major and trace geochemical data of whole rock and the major geochemical data of minerals. Samples were collected from diorite and garnet biotite schist in Gangdese belt, Nimu area, southern Tibet. The U-Pb isotopic data of zircon and monazite were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The main geochemical data of minerals are obtained by EPMA. The age of regional magmatism and metamorphism can be determined by the obtained data.",
            "instructions": "All data are stored in Excel files. The file name is â€œ UPb.xls \"which represents radioisotope data. The name of the file \"WRMajTra\" represents the major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock. The name of the file is \"MinMaj\", which represents the data of mineral major elements.",
