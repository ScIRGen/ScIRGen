            "description": "This data set contains meteorological element observation data of heihe remote sensing station in the middle reaches of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.The station is located in the east of dangzhai town, zhangye city, gansu province.The longitude and latitude of the observation point are 100.4756e, 38.8270n and 1560m above sea level.The air temperature and humidity sensor is located at 1.5m, facing due north.The barometer is in the waterproof box;The tilting bucket rain gauge is installed at 0.7 m;The wind speed and direction sensor is located at 10m, facing due north;The installation height of the four-component radiometer is 1.5m, facing due south;The installation height of the two infrared thermometers is 1.5m, facing due south and the probe facing vertically downward.The soil temperature probe is buried at 0cm on the surface and 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm underground.The soil water probe was buried at 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm.Average soil temperature probes were buried in 2cm and 4cm;The soil heat flow plate (3 pieces) is buried 6cm underground.Two photosynthetically active radiometers were set up 1.5m above the canopy (one probe vertically upwards and one probe vertically downwards), facing due south.\nObservation projects are: air temperature and humidity (Ta_1. 5 m, RH_1. 5 m) (unit: c, percentage), pressure (Press) (unit: hundred mpa), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), wind speed (WS_10m) (unit: m/s), wind (WD_10m) (unit: degrees), the radiation of four component (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts per square meter), the surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit:C), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (in watts/m2), soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_40cm, Ts_80cm, Ts_120cm, Ts_160cm) (in:C), soil moisture (Ms_0cm, Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm, Ms_10cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_40cm, Ms_80cm, Ms_120cm, Ms_160cm) (unit: %), upward and downward photosynthetically active radiation (PAR_U_up, PAR_U_down) (unit: micromole/sq.s), mean soil temperature (TCAV) (unit: Celsius).\nProcessing and quality control of observed data :(1) ensure 144 pieces of data every day (every 10min), and mark by -6999 in case of data missing;2016.1.01-1.29 due to collector problems, many observation elements have more error values;(2) excluding the time with duplicate records;(3) data that obviously exceeds the physical significance or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the part marked with red letter in the data is the data in question;(5) date and time have the same format, and date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2016-6-10-10:30;(6) the naming rule is: AWS+ site name.\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Liu et al. (2018), and for observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2011).",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.

These factors lead to incorrect estimations of soil and canopy component temperatures and subsequently affect the model's performance.",
