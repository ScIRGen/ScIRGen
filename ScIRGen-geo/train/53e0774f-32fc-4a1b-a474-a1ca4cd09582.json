                "In mountainous areas, different altitudes exhibit distinct vertical zones due to variations in water (precipitation) and heat (temperature) components, forming typical mountain vertical belts. The Sejila Mountain in southeastern Tibet has obvious characteristics of mountain vertical zones: from the foot of the mountain to the summit, there are broadleaf forests, mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests, coniferous forests, shrubs, and moss. The vegetation types in Sejila Mountain are rich, and the longevity of trees is long (Lu et al., 2015). The tree line at 4390 m is one of the highest forest lines in the world, making it a hotspot for tree ring and forest ecology research (Wang et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018). Currently, there is limited research on the vertical gradients of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain (Liang et al., 2011). Most studies by some scholars on the changes in temperature and precipitation vertical gradients in this region and its vicinity are based on the Baji Station (formerly Linzhi Station) and the nearby Bomi Station, focusing on the vertical temperature lapse rate across the entire Tibetan Plateau (Jiang Jingchao et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2001, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) and precipitation gradients (Guo et al., 2016)."

This not only deepens the understanding of the influence of slope orientation on the vertical gradient changes of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain, but also helps to better understand the physiological and ecological characteristics of plant and animal distribution with altitude changes in the region. Additionally, it provides reliable data support for future hydrological modeling in this watershed area."

The average λ from 2013 to 2018 was 0.60 °C·(100 m)^-1. The western slope had λ values ranging from 0.69 to 0.72 °C·(100 m)^-1, with 2016 also having the lowest λ and 2014 the highest. The average λ for the western slope from 2013 to 2018 was 0.71 °C·(100 m)^-1. The eastern slope had λ values between 0.53 and 0.55 °C·(100 m)^-1. Unlike the Sejila Mountain and the western slope, the lowest λ for the eastern slope occurred in 2015, while the highest was in 2017. The average λ for the eastern slope from 2013 to 2018 was 0.55 °C·(100 m)^-1. From 2013 to 2018, the average precipitation gradient on the eastern slope was 10.5 mm·(100 m)^-1, with the precipitation during the monsoon period showing a trend of first increasing, then decreasing, and then increasing again with altitude; during the non-monsoon period, the trend changed to first decreasing and then increasing. The precipitation gradient above the southeastern Tibet station was notably significant."
