                "Climate warming, which is more evident across the high mountains than in lowland areas, has led to unprecedented negative glacier mass balances worldwide, and in particular in the Himalayas. Several studies have observed rapid glacier melting and mass loss in the Bhutan Himalaya. The melt-water from these glaciers coalesces and accumulates, forming new glacial lakes or expanding existing ones. The formation of proglacial lakes can, in turn, accelerate the melting of glaciers through a positive feedback mechanism. Analysis of Landsat series imagery has revealed an increasing number and area of glacial lakes since the 1990s across the globe, in High Mountain Asia, the Third Pole region and in the Himalayas. For example, from 1990 to 2015, glacial lakes in the Himalayas have expanded by approximately 14%, with the eastern Himalayas, the location of the Bhutan Himalaya, having the highest expansion rate. The Landsat series imagery, available since 1972, is the most convenient data set for studying glacial lake evolution across the high mountains. However, past studies based on Landsat imagery are limited to the period since the 1990s and to more extended temporal scales such as those required for decadal studies. Thus, glacial lake changes before the 1990s and at shorter temporal resolutions are not well understood. The Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI), with a spatial resolution of 10 m and a 5-day revisit cycle, is ideal for examining high-frequency glacial lake change behavior, although it has been available only since 2016. Likewise, the declassified Corona KH-4, available since 1962, provides an excellent historical data archive to catalog glacial lakes since the 1960s. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data (SAR) provides excellent complementary data for glacial lake mapping, overcoming the challenges, such as cloud cover contamination, inherent in optical data."

                "We mapped Bhutanese glacial lakes from the 1960s to 2020, and used these data to determine their distribution patterns, expansion behavior, and GLOF hazard status. Our results imply that extending glacial lakes studies back to the 1960s provides new insights on glacial lake evolution from glacier-fed lakes to non-glacier-fed lakes. Additionally, we reaffirmed the capacity of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to determine annual glacial lake changes. The results from this study can be a valuable basis for future glacial lake monitoring and prioritizing limited resources for GLOF mitigation programs."
