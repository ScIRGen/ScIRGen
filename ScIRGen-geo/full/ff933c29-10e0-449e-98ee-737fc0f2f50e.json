            "description": "This data set includes precipitation data from a total of nine ground-based precipitation observation stations located in the Yadong River Valley in the middle of the Himalayas. The observation data was collected by the Hobo tumbler rain gauge developed by Onset company and exported through supporting data reading software. Accumulated counts, the rain gauge tipped once, indicating that 0.2 mm of precipitation was recorded, and the default value of -999 was used when no precipitation event occurred. We screened the collected data and eliminated abnormal values to ensure its quality. This data set has made some progress in the analysis of precipitation characteristics, satellite data verification and model simulation evaluation in this area and two academic papers have been published, which provides strong support for the analysis of precipitation characteristics in the high-altitude valleys of the Himalayas lacking ground observation data.",
            "instructions": "File naming: Precipitation data is stored in CSV format. The file name is \"Z + four digits.csv\", where Z represents the altitude and four digits represents the specific altitude of the site. For example, Z2802.csv represents the precipitation data for the site located at 2802 meters above sea level. .\nData reading method: All files in this data set can be directly opened with Excel software. The first line is the site name and recording time format (the time of recording of all files is UTC + 6), the second column indicates the recording time, and the third column represents a precipitation event. Users can write programs for subsequent processing according to their needs (such as Fortran).",

                "Current climate models often have significant wet biases in the Tibetan Plateau and encounter particular difficulties in representing the climatic effect of the Central Himalaya Mountain (CHM), where the gradient of elevation is extremely steep and the terrain is complex. The Himalayas are a natural barrier to water vapor transport from South Asia into the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Water vapor transport in this region directly affects the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the TP and even in East Asia. The water vapor entering the TP from the southern boundary is mainly controlled by the low-pressure troughs and the meso- and micro-scale low-pressure systems, which can bring more water vapor to the TP than the dominant South Asian High during the summer monsoon season. The formation of meso- and micro-scale weather systems are closely related to complex terrain, which can increase wind shear, directly affect local convective activities, and provide favorable conditions for generating precipitation. The Central Himalayas (CHM) is characterized by steep and complex terrain with ridges and valleys crisscrossed. However, CHM is one of the most difficult areas for satellite remote sensing and meteorological simulations. Meanwhile, both global and regional climate models show systematic deviations in the simulated precipitation and precipitable water vapor in the complex terrain region. One of the key factors contributing to the simulation biases is the inappropriate representation of complex terrain for moisture transport and precipitation process in the Himalayas and its surroundings. Regional climate models at a high-spatial-resolution are particularly useful to depict the terrain more realistically, and thus describe the impacts of orography on the wind speed and pathway of moisture more accurately. A sub-grid topography parameterization scheme can also be used to improve the description of orography effects without modifying the model horizontal resolution and save computing resources. These studies show that using high horizontal resolution or sub-grid orography drag parameterization schemes can improve the representation of complex terrain effect in regional climate models."

This study attempts to use WRF model at a high horizontal resolution of several kilometers (0.03°) and TOFD scheme to examine their impacts on the simulations of precipitation over the CHM, and then analyze the errors in the high and low altitudes of the CHM."

                "However, the correlation at daily scale is low, indicating it is still a big challenge to simulate the short-term variability of precipitation over the complex terrain. A potential risk in the evaluation is the scale-mismatch between the observations and the coarse-resolution (e.g. 0.09°) modeling for this terrain-complex region. The insufficient description of multi-scale orographic impacts in climate/weather models is a key factor that leads to the wet (dry) bias over the high (low) CHM in the simulated precipitation."

The control case uses a high horizontal resolution (0.03°) and a Turbulent Orographic Form Drag (TOFD) scheme to resolve the mesoscale terrain and to represent sub-grid microscale terrain effect. In this study, the precipitation over the Yadong Valley was simulated by WRF and validated against in situ observations. To study the influence of complex terrain on water vapor transport and precipitation, 14 rain-gauges (named RG01, RG02 … RG14) were set up along the Yadong Valley from the south (about 2800 m a.s.l) to the north (about 4500 m a.s.l) side of the CHM. In order to represent impacts of the mesoscale and microscale orography on the moisture transport and precipitation over the CHM, a control experiment and two sensitivity simulation experiments using WRF model were designed. For all the three WRF experiments, the simulation period is July 19–August 10, 2018."

                "The Himalaya are the world’s highest mountain range, extending over 2,400 km east-west and 200-300 km north-south. This mountainous area with complex topography covers approximately 600,000 km2, with slopes on the southern edge being generally steep, and northern slopes which have a relatively moderate gradient. Dynamic blocking of the South Asian summer monsoon by this terrain causes high precipitation across the southern slopes in summer, supporting abundant vegetation (except in high-altitude areas). Conversely, the north side is much drier and the vegetation is sparse. The uplifting of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau (TP) regulates the evolution of the Asian monsoon system (An et al., 2001). The heat source over this elevated region strongly modulates the variability of the South Asian summer monsoon (Yanai et al., 1992), thereby exerting an important influence on precipitation across the TP. Surface heating along the southern slopes of the Himalaya during the pre-monsoon season (March-May or MAM) can enhance the ascending airflow and even trigger the onset of the monsoonal flow from South Asia, bringing significant precipitation to the Himalaya and the TP (Wu et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the complex terrain of the Himalaya plays an important role in controlling the patterns of precipitation and water vapor exchange between the TP and South Asia (Lin et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018)."

This combination of in-situ and IMERG precipitation data reveals two unique characteristics in the CHR. Firstly, precipitation during the pre-monsoon season (March-May) contributes 20-40% of the annual total, from the high altitudes of the CHR to Southeast TP, due to water vapor flux conveyed by southwesterlies from the Bay of Bengal, whereas this percentage is much lower in the northern Himalaya and South Asia. Secondly, diurnal variations in precipitation during the monsoon season (June-September) vary between the low and high altitudes of the north-south oriented valleys in the CHR: precipitation at high altitudes has two peaks (one in the afternoon and the other at night), which is different from the single night-time peak in low altitudes that is usually reported."
