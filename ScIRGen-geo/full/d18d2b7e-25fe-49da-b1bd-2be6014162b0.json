            "description": "The Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model was developed by Sugita (2007) to correct for bias due to inter-taxonomic differences in pollen productivity and dispersion and estimate plant cover at a regional spatial scale based on pollen records. We provide the dataset of pollen-based REVEALS reconstruction for temperate and northern sub-tropical China over the Holocene. The REVEALS reconstruction was achieved using 94 selected pollen records from lakes and bogs at a 1˚x1˚ spatial scale and a temporal resolution of 500 years between 11.7 and 0.7 ka BP, and three recent time windows (0.7˗0.35 ka BP, 0.35˗0.1 ka BP, and 0.1 ka BP˗present). \nThe dataset of pollen-based REVEALS reconstruction of Holocene plant cover for the study region includes the REVEALS proportions of plant cover (and related SEs) for 75 1˚x 1˚grid cells and 25 time windows for each grid cell for 27 taxa, two alternatives of aggregation of plant taxa to PFTs: ten PFTs and six PFTs, and three land-cover types. The metadata files providing details on the sites used in the REVEALS reconstruction for each grid cell and each time window. For instance, the original site names, modern vegetation zones, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees), elevation in meters above sea level, site types (bog or lake), basin sizes (radius and area), number of 14C radiocarbon dates or other types of dates, approximate temporal extent of the site. The dataset is suitable for palaeoclimate modeling, can be applied also in evaluating simulations of past vegetation from dynamic vegetation models and anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) scenarios.",
            "instructions": "The dataset of pollen-based REVEALS estimates of Holocene plant cover for temperate and northern sub-tropical China comprises four csv files with the REVEALS proportions of plant cover (and related SEs) for 75 1˚x 1˚grid cells and 25 time windows for each grid cell for 27 taxa (Data1.plants.csv), 2) six PFTs (Data2.6PFTs.csv), 3) three land-cover types (Data3.LCTs.csv) and 4）ten PFTs (Data4.10PFTs.csv). The grid_cell column in the data table is represented as coordinates of left bottom corner, time_window column shows the interval between the starting and end time of the data compiled for reconstruction, e.g. 100-350 represent 350-100 BP (before present). Four additional files are complementing various information for the REVEALS dataset. Such as the metadata (Table S1, pollen data for details), the details on the sites used in the REVEALS reconstruction for each grid cell and each time window (Table S2), three Land-cover types (LCTs) and six plant functional types (PFTs) and their corresponding pollen morphological types (Table S3), and finally ten plant functional types (PFTs) and their corresponding pollen morphological types Table S4.\nScientific paper of the 10 PFTs has been published in Li et al.

                "Vegetation has undergone changes all over the globe throughout the Holocene as a result of climate change from the early Holocene on and disturbance from anthropogenic activities from the mid-Holocene on. Pollen data mapping can provide insights into temporal and spatial vegetation changes at broad continental scales. However, the quantification of past vegetation changes based on fossil pollen data is necessary to answer specific research questions on the relationship between plant cover and e.g. climate or biodiversity. Techniques such as biomization and the modern analogue technique (MAT) have been widely applied to reconstruct past continental-scale changes in vegetation cover. These techniques have the disadvantage that they cannot quantify the cover of individual plant taxa. The possible effects of anthropogenic land-cover (LC) transformation due to past land-use (LU) changes (LULC changes) on the Holocene climate is still an issue of debate. Current earth system models (ESMs) take care of the climate–land vegetation interactions by coupling a dynamic vegetation model (DVM) with the climate model. DVMs simulate climate-induced (natural) vegetation. Therefore, past LULC changes have to be estimated to study their effect on past climate. The anthropogenic land-cover change (ALCC) scenarios most commonly used by palaeoclimate modellers are those from the HYDE database and the KK10 dataset of past deforestation. These scenarios are based on a number of assumptions for population growth, per-capita land use, and other parameters that influenced land use over time in the past. Therefore, a current priority is to produce datasets of pollen- and archaeology-based data of past LU and LC that can be used in palaeoclimate modelling or the evaluation of DVMs and ALCCs. Several reconstructions of the biomes and vegetation cover of China during the Holocene are available. However, these reconstructions do not provide quantitative information on the spatial extent of deforested land within woodland biomes or of vegetation types including both trees and herbs."

REVEALS was intended for pollen records from large lakes. Pollen records from bogs violate the model’s assumption that no plants are growing on the surface of the deposition basin. The uncertainty in the RPP estimates used is another factor influencing the reliability of the REVEALS reconstructions. The number of values available in the calculation of the mean RPP estimates and the locations of the RPP studies in terms of vegetation zones are provided in Table 1. The REVEALS model estimates the proportion of each plant taxon in relation to the total cover of all taxa with the RPP estimates available (in this case, 27 taxa) rather than its actual cover if all existing taxa could be considered."

There is a consistent increase in CT cover in most grid cells over northern China during the first half of the Holocene, with maximum values occurring sometime between 8 and 5 ka (the timing depends on the region), before a steady decline in the values of CT cover. The changes in cover of BT during the Holocene show similar trends to those for CT: a steady increase during the first half of the Holocene, with the highest values found in the time windows from 8.2–7.7 to 5.2–4.7 ka (depending on the region), followed by a steady decrease through the late Holocene."

                    "Answer": "The REVEALS model uses high-quality pollen records from lakes and bogs at a 1°x1° spatial scale with a temporal resolution of 500 years for most of the Holocene and increased resolution in recent times. In contrast, biomization and MAT often do not provide quantitative cover information for individual plant taxa and may have limitations in spatial and temporal resolution.",
