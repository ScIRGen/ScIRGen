            "description": "The observational alpine meadow site (34.62°N, 97.32°E) is located in the central HAYR, with an elevation of 4490 m a.s.l. Active layer thickness was ~1.2-1.3 m. Soil temperatures at 0.5, 5.0, 10, and 20 cm depths were monitored by thermometers, which were calibrated by the State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soils Engineering (SKLFSE), with an accuracy <0.05 °C. Soil VWC at 10, 40, and 80 cm depths in the active layer were measured using 5 TE Probes (Decagon Devices, Inc.; Website: www.decagon.com). The accuracy of the VWC measured in soils varied between ±0.01 and ± 0.02 cm3 cm3. The CR300 data logger (Campbell Scientific, Inc.), powered by solar panels through batteries, was used to obtain data.",

                    "Answer": "Thermal resistors, like those developed by the State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soil Engineering, are used for measuring soil temperature at various depths with high precision (<0.05 °C) in peatland wetland environments. The 5 TE probes are employed to measure soil volumetric water content (VWC) at different depths, with a precision between ±0.01 and ±0.02 cm3 cm3. These instruments are critical for accurately monitoring the thermal and hydrological processes in the active layer of peatland wetlands, which are essential for validating hydrological and land surface process models.",

                    "Answer": "The precision of temperature measurements, with an accuracy of <0.05 °C, allows for a detailed understanding of minor temperature fluctuations in the peatland's active layer. Similarly, the soil volumetric water content (VWC) precision between ±0.01 and ±0.02 cm3 cm3 ensures reliable data on moisture levels. These precise measurements can help infer the relationship between temperature variations and moisture dynamics, enabling nuanced interpretations of the hydrological and thermal processes within the peatland ecosystem.",
