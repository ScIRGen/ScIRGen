            "description": "The Third Pole experiences accelerated glacier retreating particularly in the eastern\u0002Himalaya, coinciding with a decrease of monsoon-precipitation in the early 21st century. In the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo basin, both of glacier melting and rainfall are rich, but the contribution to the surface runoff and the impact is unknown. The extent to which the vanishing abundant maritime glaciers buffer the declining precipitation-runoff in the upstream of upper Brahmaputra basin (UBB) remains unclear. With a state-of-the-art enthalpy-based distributed cryosphere-hydrology model and first-hand hydrometeorology observations at Motuo (latest accessible Chinese county), we carefully examine hydrological processes in the Yarlung Zangbo basin along Himalayas.",

This understanding is crucial to assess the extent to which the disappearance of numerous oceanic glaciers has mitigated the reduction in precipitation runoff in the basin.",
