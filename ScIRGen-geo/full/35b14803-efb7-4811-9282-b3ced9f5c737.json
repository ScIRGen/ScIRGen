            "description": "Oases around the Tarim Basin (TB), northwestern China, as key stations of the“Silk Road”in thehistoric time and the modern Silk Road Economic Belt, have been critical areas for human production and living since ancient times. It is crucial to investigate the process and mechanism of the evolution of these oases in the TB to explore the relationship between oasis evolution and human activities. Twenty-four publications on oasis and fluvial-lacustrine deposit sections in the basin since 28 ka were selected, including 262 oasis and 120 fluvial-lacustrine deposit dating results. These ages are of great significance to understanding the oases evolution and hydrological processes of Tarim Basin.",

By analyzing these ages, researchers can infer the mechanisms driving oasis evolution and the associated hydrological processes, which are crucial for understanding both historical and contemporary human habitation and the role of the region as a node on ancient and modern Silk Roads.",
