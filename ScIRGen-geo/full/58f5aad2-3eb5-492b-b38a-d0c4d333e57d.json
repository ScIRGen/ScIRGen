These data are used to train an SVR model through distance block resampling of training data. The model is calibrated and validated using mean annual ground temperature measurements from 237 boreholes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Cross-validation is employed to select the optimal model, which is then used to simulate mean annual ground temperature and classify permafrost stability and extent.",
