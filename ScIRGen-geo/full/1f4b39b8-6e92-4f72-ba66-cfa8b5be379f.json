According to vegetation characteristics, four types include alpine swamp meadow (ASM), alpine meadow (AM), alpine steppe (AS), and alpine desert (AD) were classified in this map. Based on a spatial resolution of 30 m, the map can provide more detailed vegetation information.",

It utilizes multiple input variables, such as spectral bands from satellite data like Landsat-8, vegetation indices, and surface temperature data, to improve the accuracy of the classification process. This method is particularly useful for distinguishing between different types of vegetation in a given area, such as alpine swamp meadow, alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert.",
