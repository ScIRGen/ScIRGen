            "description": "\"Digital data including slope and aspect (slope and aspect) data are the basic data of GIS, and can be used as two important indicators to describe the terrain feature information, which can not only indirectly express the relief shape and structure of the terrain, It includes hydrological model, landslide monitoring and analysis, surface material movement, soil erosion, land use planning, etc\nThe basic data of geoscience analysis model. At present, slope and aspect data are generally calculated by certain calculation model on digital elevation model (DEM). This data takes 34 key nodes of Pan third pole as the research area, takes DEM data with resolution of 30 meters as the base, realizes the digital simulation of slope and aspect in terrain data (that is, the digital expression of slope and aspect in terrain surface data), and finally obtains the slope and aspect data of pan third pole key nodes.\nThe data area is 34 key nodes of Pan third pole (Abbas, Astana, Colombo, Gwadar, Mengba, Teheran, Vientiane, etc.).",

These data serve as crucial indicators of terrain characteristics by representing the slope (the steepness or incline) and aspect (the compass direction that a slope faces) of a landscape. This information is vital for various geoscientific analyses and models, including hydrological modeling, landslide monitoring, surface material movement, soil erosion, and land use planning. Typically, slope and aspect data are derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using specific computational models.",
