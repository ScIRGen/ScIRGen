This dataset agrees well with several observational temperature datasets during the instrumental period, and has a similar level of reliability as the Twentieth Century Reanalysis which assimilates surface pressure observations. In addition, the dataset shows a high level of agreement with previous proxy-based reconstructions (average correlation of annual mean TP temperatures is r = 0.61).  The dataset can be used to study the temperature variability over the TP and some regions of the TP during the past millennium (1000-2000 AD).",

                "The Arctic has warmed more than twice the global average since the preindustrial era, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). AA is evident in instrumental observations and climate model simulations and is commonly thought to be caused by positive ice-albedo feedback associated with sea-ice loss. However, AA also occurs in models without ice-albedo feedback, challenging the view that sea ice is the key factor for AA. Much uncertainty remains about the mechanisms behind and their relative importance to AA, as evidenced by the disagreement about future AA by model projections and the general overestimation of AA by models. Understanding how and why AA has changed over the last millennium provides a useful long-term perspective for the ongoing and future climate changes. Limited by the length of instrumental observations, most studies on AA have focused on the industrial era characterized by anthropogenic warming, especially during the last decades, which makes it difficult to distinguish natural and human-induced contributions to AA.",
                "The approach is a state-of-the-art and best-of-both-worlds method for estimating past climate fields by assimilating proxy records into a climate model, and shows several distinct advantages over the existing climate field reconstruction methods. The number and types of assimilated proxy records in this study, especially those over high latitudes, far exceed those in previous NH temperature reconstructions, creating a great potential to provide a more reliable estimate of AA over the last millennium than previous studies.",
                "AA is typically defined as the ratio between a change in Arctic temperature to a corresponding change in NH or global temperature over a specific period. Over the past millennium, the AA index ranged from 1.21 to 2.12 with a mean of 1.76, indicating that the amplification of Arctic temperature changes (AA index > 1) is an inherent feature of the climate system regardless of warm or cold periods, which is consistent with the findings of previous paleoclimate studies. The reconstructed AA index exhibits strong multidecadal variations and was strongest during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1015–1100). In addition, the low variability in the reconstructed Arctic sea ice extent series may also be a possible reason responsible for the weak correlation. The PAGES2K Consortium recently published a new-generation global proxy dataset, and the proxies included in this new-generation dataset have been ascertained to regionally covary with temperature; hence, those proxies are well suited to reconstruct temperature.",
                "There is a solid theoretical basis that GHG forcing weakens AA because the GHG radiative forcing is strongest over the tropics, although an analysis of model simulations has suggested that the negative effect of GHG on AA is small. The modulation of AA by the AMO conforms with the observation that a large portion of regional and hemispheric NH temperature changes can be attributed to changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperature. The AMO signal propagates throughout the NH via a sequence of atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections and partly modulates poleward energy transport via atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Our finding that the strength of AA is closely linked to the AMO on multidecadal time scales highlights the importance of the background internal climate variability related to the ocean circulation in regulating heat transport in the NH."

                "We used the PDA method to assimilate 396 recently released, multi-type, annually resolved and temperature-sensitive proxy records (see Fig. 1 and Methods) from the PAGES2K Consortium.",
                "To further verify the reconstruction over the whole millennium, we conducted an experiment where we randomly selected 75% of the proxy records to use in the assimilation, and withheld the remaining 25% for verification. To investigate the roles played by key climatic indicators in the Arctic, large-scale internal modes of variability and different forcings on AA over the past millennium, we performed a correlation analysis between the millennial AA index and several reconstructed climate indices for local climate, important modes of climate variability as well as forcings. In this study, we used a linear-univariate proxy system model (PSM) (see Eq. (5)), which maps temperature to proxy measurements by fitting proxy data to gridded instrumental temperature data. Our PDA experiment was conducted to reconstruct 2 m air temperature fields during the period from 1000–2000 AD. In the PDA experiment, the assimilation was performed one year at a time, yielding an annual mean ensemble mean analysis for each year, which is the climate field reconstruction for that year."

                "The decreased AA during the industrial era was strongly associated with the anthropogenic forcing, proving the emerging role of the forcing in reducing the AA strength.",
                "Over the past millennium, the reconstructed AA index exhibits a statistically significant (95% confidence level) downward trend of −0.04/100 years (p < 0.001, see Fig.3a).",
                "The reconstructed AA index reveals that near-surface temperature changes are invariably enhanced in the Arctic relative to the whole NH, suggesting that AA is an inherent feature of the global climate system driven by positive feedback mechanisms. Additionally, the strength of AA is strongly dependent on the phase of the AMO, with positive AMO phases favoring stronger AA. Another important finding is that GHGs forcing has likely had a significant role in the apparent weakening AA during the 20th century by heating near-surface temperatures more in the lower latitudes than the higher latitudes, resulting in lower AA values despite the enhanced Arctic warming and sea ice loss in recent decades. This work provides a crucial baseline against which the ongoing and future changes in AA can be compared."
