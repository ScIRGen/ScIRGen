            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Zhangye-Yingke-Huazhaizi flight zone on Jun. 1, 2008.\n     Data available for general users include Level-2C data (after geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections). Level-1B browse image (after intra-band matching) and Level-2B browse image (intra-band after registration). The raw data, Level-1A, and data processing parameters were filed; applications would be evaluated prior to access. Data processing started Aug. 2008 and ended Apr. 2009, and in Nov. 2009, CCD data were reprocessed to adjust radiometric calibration. \n     The raw data set included 12 flight routs, some of which were repeated. There was discrepancy about 1.4s between exposure time of CCD images at 650nm/750nm and that of 550nm/700nm. Images in different bands has been matched during pre-processing. However, in areas with large elevation changes, intra-bands match error still existed.\n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id\n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 3#15  ||  1500m || 13:35:46 || 13:39:37  || 59 || incomplete || incomplete\n|-\n| 2 || 3#13  ||  1500m || 13:43:21 || 13:51:33  || 75 || incomplete || incomplete\n|-\n| 3 || 3#11 ||  1500m || 13:54:41 || 14:03:17 || 41 || incomplete || incomplete || the resort, Yingke oasis maize field, and wheat field \n|-\n| 4 || 3#11a  ||  1500m || 14:07:23 || 14:14:46  || 111 || incomplete || incomplete  ||  the resort, Yingke oasis maize field, and wheat field\n|- \n| 5 || 3#9 || 1500m || 14:18:21 || 14:26:17 || 119 || processed;complete || good || wetland park, Zhangye city, Yingke oasis maize field, and wheat field, Huazhaizi desert maize plot\n|- \n| 6 || 3#7 || 1500m || 14:31:01 || 14:38:25 || 112 || processed;complete || good \n|- \n| 7 || 3#5 || 1500m || 14:42:05 || 14:50:01 || 120 || incomplete || incomplete || Huazhaizi desert plot 1\n|-  \n| 8 || 3#3 || 1500m || 14:53:49 || 15:02:41 || 134 || processed;complete || good || Huazhaizi desert plot 2 \n|- \n| 9 || 3#1 || 1500m || 15:07:01 || 15:14:41 || 116 || processed;complete ||\ngood\n|-\n| 10 || 3#11b || 1500m || 15:20:05 || 15:26:37  || 99 || processed;complete || good || the resort, Yingke oasis maize field, and wheat field \n|-\n| 11 || 3#13a || 1500m || 15:30:45 || 15:39:01  || 125 || processed;complete || good\n|- \n| 12 || 3#5a || 1500m || 15:42:48 || 15:50:05  || 111 || processed;complete || good || Huazhaizi desert plot 1\n|}",

The objectives of processing and correcting the data collected include achieving geometric correction, radiometric calibration, and atmospheric correction to ensure accuracy and reliability of the data products for further analysis. These corrections help to minimize errors due to instrument instability and environmental conditions, and they enhance the utility of the data for typical users by providing Level-2C products and visualizations in Level-1B and Level-2B formats.",
