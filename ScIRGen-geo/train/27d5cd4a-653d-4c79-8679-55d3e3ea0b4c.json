            "description": "This data is composed of major and trace elements, zircon trace elements, U-Pb and Lu HF data of diorite and monzodiorite in Xuhuai area, Northern Anhui Province. The major element data were obtained by XRF analysis, trace element data by ICP-MS analysis, zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data by la-mc-icp-ms analysis.. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, it can be analyzed that the early Cretaceous igneous suite related to iron, copper and gold deposits in Xuhuai area is the result of the recycling subduction of the Pacific ocean crust.",
