            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jul. 11, 2008. WiDAS, composed of four CCD cameras, one mid-infrared thermal imager (AGEMA 550), and one infrared thermal imager (S60), can acquire CCD, MIR and TIR band data. These simultaneous ground data were mainly the land surface temperature measured by the hand-held infrared thermometer in the reed plot A, the saline plots B and C, the alfalfa plot D and the barley plot E, the maximum of which were 120m×120m and the minimum were 30m×30m. Data were archived in Excel file. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",
