            "titleEn": "Passive microwave SSM/I brightness temperature dataset for China (1987-2007)",
            "description": "This data set includes the microwave brightness temperatures obtained by the spaceborne microwave radiometer SSM/I carried by the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite. It contains the twice daily (ascending and descending) brightness temperatures of seven channels, which are 19H, 19V, 22V, 37H, 37V, 85H, and 85V.\nThe Specialized Microwave Imager (SSM/I) was developed by the Hughes Corporation of the United States. In 1987, it was first carried into the space on the Block 5D-/F8 satellite of the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) to perform a detection mission. In the 10 years from when the DMSP soared to orbit in 1987 to when the TRMM soared to orbit in 1997, the SSM/I was the world's most advanced spaceborne passive microwave remote sensing detection instrument, having the highest spatial resolution in the world. The DMSP satellite is in a near-polar circular solar synchronous orbit; the elevation is approximately 833 km, the inclination is 98.8 degrees, and the orbital period is 102.2 minutes. It passes through the equator at approximately 6:00 local time and covers the whole world once every 24 hours. The SSM/I consists of seven channels set at four frequencies, and the center frequencies are 19.35, 22.24, 37.05, and 85.50 GHz. The instrument actually comprises seven independent, total-power, balanced-mixing, superheterodyne passive microwave radiometer systems, and it can simultaneously measure microwave radiation from Earth and the atmospheric systems. Except for the 22.24 GHz frequency, all the frequencies have both horizontal and vertical polarization states.\nSome Eigenvalues of SSM/I\nChannel Frequency\n(GHz) Polarization Mode (V/H) Spatial Resolution\n(km * km) Footprint Size\n(km)\n19V 19.35 V 25×25 56\n19H 19.35 H 25×25 56\n22V 22.24 V 25×25 45\n37V 37.05 V 25×25 33\n37H 37.05 H 25×25 33\n85V 85.50 V 12.5×12.5 14\n85H 85.50 H 12.5×12.5 14\n1. File Format and Naming:\nEach group of data consists of remote sensing data files, .JPG image files and .met auxiliary information files as well as .TIM time information files and the corresponding .met time information auxiliary files.\nThe data file names and naming rules for each group in the SSMI_Grid_China directory are as follows:\nChina-EASE-Fnn-ML/HaaaabbbA/D.ccH/V (remote sensing data);\nChina-EASE-Fnn -ML/HaaaabbbA/D.ccH/V.jpg (image file);\nChina-EASE-Fnn-ML/HaaaabbbA/D.ccH/V.met (auxiliary information document);\nChina-EASE-Fnn-ML/HaaaabbbA/D.TIM (time information file); and\nChina-EASE- Fnn -ML/HaaaabbbA/D.TIM.met (time information auxiliary file).\nAmong them, EASE stands for EASE-Grid projection mode; Fnn represents carrier satellite number (F08, F11, and F13); ML/H represents multichannel low resolution and multichannel high resolution; A/D stands for ascending (A) and descending (D); aaaa represents the year; bbb represents the Julian day of the year; cc represents the channel number (19H, 19V, 22V, 37H, 37V, 85H, and 85V); and H/V represents horizontal polarization (H) and vertical polarization (V).\n2. Coordinate System and Projection:\nThe projection method is an equal-area secant cylindrical projection, and the double standard latitude is 30 degrees north and south. For more information on EASE-GRID, please refer to http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/globalgrids-book/ease_grid/. If you need to convert the EASE-Grid projection method into a geographic projection method, please refer to the ease2geo.prj file, which reads as follows.\nInput\nProjection cylindrical\nUnits meters\nParameters 6371228 6371228\n1 /* Enter projection type (1, 2, or 3)\n0 00 00 /* Longitude of central meridian\n30 00 00 /* Latitude of standard parallel\nOutput\nProjection GEOGRAPHIC\nSpheroid KRASovsky\nUnits dd\nParameters\nEnd\n3. Data Format:\nStored as binary integers, Row number: 308 *166,each datum occupies 2 bytes. The data that are actually stored in this data set are the brightness temperatures *10, and after reading the data, they need to be divided by 10 to obtain true brightness temperature.\n4.

                    "Answer": "The challenges in collecting and processing passive microwave brightness temperature data from the SSM/I sensor over China's region between 1987 and 2007 could include the complexity of operating advanced spaceborne passive microwave radiometers like the SSM/I, which was among the most advanced of its time, requiring precise calibration and handling. The data involves multiple frequency channels and polarizations (19H, 19V, 22V, 37H, 37V, 85H, 85V), which necessitates intricate data processing techniques to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the need to manage various data formats (remote sensing data files, JPG image files, and .met auxiliary information files) and convert projections from EASE-Grid to Geographic could also pose significant challenges. The spatial and temporal resolutions, alongside the wide spatial coverage required, further complicate data collection and processing efforts.",

Each channel and polarization offers unique data that can be combined to give a more comprehensive understanding of the observed area.

The data provides insights into various environmental and climatic processes by capturing different frequency responses and polarizations, allowing for comprehensive analysis of phenomena such as precipitation, snow cover, and sea ice extent.

The instrument collects data across seven channels at four frequencies (19.35, 22.24, 37.05, and 85.50 GHz) with both horizontal and vertical polarization, resulting in daily coverage of the globe. The data is stored in integer binary format with a spatial resolution of 25 km and 12.5 km for the 85 GHz channel, and a temporal resolution of daily measurements. The brightness temperatures are stored as 10 times the actual value and need to be divided by 10 to obtain the real brightness temperature. Data files are organized in a specific naming convention based on satellite number, resolution, orbital pass, year, Julian day, channel, and polarization. The EASE-Grid projection is used, which can be converted to Geographic projection using specified parameters.",
