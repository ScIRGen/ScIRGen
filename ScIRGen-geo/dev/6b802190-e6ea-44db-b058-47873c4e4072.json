            "description": "Using the Modis1B data of 11 scenes from 2003 to 2013 (the ice shelf Modis1B data published on the NSIDC website), the surface velocity of the Antarctic Amery Ice Shelf was extracted by the subpixel cross-correlation method, the ice velocity was extracted by the COSI-Corr software, and then the time sequence of annual average velocities for nearly ten years was obtained. Due to the lack of field observations in the study area, the accuracy of the ice flow results was estimated by using the offset value of the stable region, and the ice flow error was approximately ±50 m/year. The ice velocity data date from 2003 to 2013, the temporal resolution is one year, and the data cover the Amery area with a spatial resolution of 500 m. A GeoTIFF file of velocity data is stored every year.\nFor details regarding the data, please refer to the Amery Ice Flow Field - Data Description.",

                    "Answer": "The '亚像元互相关方法' refers to the sub-pixel cross-correlation method used in extracting surface flow velocities from satellite imagery. In the context of ice shelf studies, it is utilized to derive the movement of the ice surface by analyzing temporal changes in image sequences, allowing for the calculation of flow velocities with high precision. This method is particularly useful for regions like the Amery Ice Shelf, where in-situ observations are limited.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of extracting ice flow velocity using sub-pixel cross-correlation of Modis1B data, as applied to the Antarctic Amery Ice Shelf, is evaluated using offset values from stable regions, resulting in an error of approximately ±50m/year. This method provides an annual velocity field with a spatial resolution of 500m over a decade from 2003 to 2013. This approach is particularly useful in areas lacking ground-based observations.",

Currently, the dataset relies on satellite data and assesses accuracy using stable region offsets with an error of approximately ±50m/year. Incorporating ground-based observations could provide additional validation data, potentially refining the accuracy of the ice flow measurements by offering more precise local calibration and cross-verification.",

These methods help in creating a reliable time series of annual average flow velocities, which are essential for understanding the ice shelf's behavior and potential changes due to environmental factors.",
