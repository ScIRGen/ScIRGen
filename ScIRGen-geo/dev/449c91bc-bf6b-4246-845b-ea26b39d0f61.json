These satellites, equipped with X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), provide all-weather, all-time Earth observation capabilities with radar interferometry. In 2012, three scenes of COSMO-SkyMed imagery were obtained for an ecological and hydrological experiment in a middle-reach artificial oasis, using the PingPong mode with 15 m resolution and SLC product level, featuring VV/VH, HH/HV, and VV/VH polarization modes.",
