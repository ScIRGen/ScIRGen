      "description": "30m month compositing Fraction Vegetation Cover (FVC) data set of Heihe River Basin provides the results of monthly FVC synthesis in 2011-2014. The data constructs multi-angle observation data sets by using China's domestic satellite HJ/CCD data with high temporal resolution (2 days after networking) and spatial resolution (30m) , and divides the country into different vegetation divisions and land types. The conversion coefficients of NDVI and FVC are calculated respectively, and use the calculated conversion coefficient lookup table and monthly compositing NDVI to produce the regional monthly compositing FVC products. The 30m month compositing FVC product in the Heihe River Basin can directly obtain the vegetation coverage ratio through high-resolution data, and mitigate the influence of low-resolution data heterogeneity; in addition, selecting the typical period of vegetation growth change, by fitting the vegetation index of each pixel time series to obtain the growth curve parameters that correspond to each pixel; then the land use map and the vegetation classification map are combined to find the representative uniform pixels of the region for training the conversion coefficients of the vegetation index. Compared with the ASTER reference FVC results, the 30m/month compositing FVC product in the Heihe River Basin is slightly higher than the ASTER reference result, but the overall deviation is not large, and the maximum value of the root mean square error (RMSE) of the product and the reference value is less than 0.175. In addition, compared with the ground survey data of Huailai experimental site in Hebei Province, the 30 m/month compositing FVC products generally reflect the seasonal variation of vegetation growth, and the deviation from the ground survey data is less than 0.1. At the same time, compared with the ground measurements of vegetation coverage in many watersheds in Northeast, North China and Southeast China, the overall error between the compositing FVC products and the ground measurements is less than 0.2. In all, the 30m/month compositing FVC data set of Heihe River Basin comprehensively utilizes multi-temporal and multi-angle remote sensing data to improve the estimation accuracy and time resolution of FVC parameter products, so as to better serve the application of remote sensing data products.",

It characterizes the fraction of vegetation on a flat background covered by vegetation, thereby accounting for the amount of vegetation distributed in a horizontal perspective. For such, an accurate assessment of FVC is mandatory for a thorough description of land surface processes in the surface parameterization schemes implemented in the climate and weather forecasting models. Besides, the FVC is relevant for a wide range of Land Biosphere Applications such as agriculture and forestry, environmental management and land use, hydrology, natural hazards monitoring and management, vegetation-soil dynamics monitoring, drought conditions and fire scar extent. Two main approaches exist to estimate FVC and other bio-physical parameter like Leaf Area Index (LAI). The first one is based upon empirical relationships with vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
