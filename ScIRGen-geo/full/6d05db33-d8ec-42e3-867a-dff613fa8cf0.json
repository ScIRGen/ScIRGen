            "titleEn": "Geochemical data set of Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic sedimentary rocks  in Yunnan Ailaoshan and Baoshan area (202-543 Ma)",
            "description": "The data set includes: longitude and latitude, lithological information, chronological data, O isotope composition and major and trace element composition of sedimentary rock samples from Permian Triassic and Cambrian Silurian clastic strata in Ailaoshan structural belt and Baoshan area, Yunnan Province. The chronological data of rock samples are determined by laser ablation plasma mass spectrometry (la-mc-icpms) of detrital zircon, and the error of Single Zircon 91500 is less than 5%; The main elements were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) by melting the rock powder into a glass sheet which can be tested on the computer. The analytical accuracy of the standard materials gbw-07111, gbw-123, gsr-1, gsr-2 and gsr-3 was better than 2%; Trace elements were analyzed by Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the process of analysis and test, USGS reference materials (bhvo-2, avg-2, gsr-1, gsr-2, gsr-3, gsd-9 and sarm-4) were determined. As the external test standard, the element content of the test sample was more accurate than 3%. The oxygen isotope data are obtained by SIMS of detrital zircon. The external accuracy of the multiple determination results of Penglai standard sample is better than 0.30 ‰ (2 σ，  n = 24)。 The obtained detrital zircon age spectrum of Permian Triassic clastic sedimentary rocks in Ailaoshan, as well as major and trace element compositions, can be used to effectively limit the evolution process of ancient Tethys Ailaoshan Ocean from subduction to closure, which has been published in international well-known journals such as tectonics, GSA bulletin and Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, And the famous domestic journal geotectonics and mineralization. The data can be widely used in the future to limit the study of the evolution history of the paleo ocean basin. The obtained detrital zircon age spectrum and Hf isotope data of Cambrian Devonian clastic rocks in Baoshan area can be used to effectively limit the tectonic position of Baoshan block in the early Paleozoic. The relevant data have been published in the well-known domestic journal Acta petrologica, and the data can be widely used in the reconstruction of Gondwana continent in the future.",

These patterns have been published in international journals like Tectonics, GSA Bulletin, and Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, indicating their significance in understanding the tectonic evolution. Additionally, the detrital zircon age spectra and Hf isotopic data from the Baoshan area's Cambrian-Devonian sedimentary rocks can be instrumental in determining the tectonic position of the Baoshan block during the Early Paleozoic, and these findings have been published in the domestic journal 'Acta Petrologica Sinica', showing potential for future research on Gondwana reconstruction.",
