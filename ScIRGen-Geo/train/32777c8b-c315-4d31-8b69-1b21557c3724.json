            "description": "The Qinghai Tibet Plateau is surrounded by regions with high global carbon aerosol emissions, and the surrounding black carbon and brown carbon can be transmitted to the plateau. Light absorbing black carbon and brown carbon have warming effect, and their settlement on the surface of ice and snow will also accelerate the melting of glaciers and snow. At present, there is little research on brown carbon in this area, and the research on the correlation between brown carbon components and optics is in its infancy. Therefore, the study of Atmospheric Black Carbon and brown carbon in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau has important climate and environmental significance. The aerosol optical absorption characteristics of Atmospheric Black Carbon and brown carbon were obtained by observing in different regions of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. It reveals the spatial differences of optical absorption of black carbon, primary Brown carbon and secondary Brown carbon aerosols in different regions of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                "The important light-absorbing components in the atmosphere include mineral dust, black carbon (BC), and brown carbon (BrC). BrC can be divided into primary BrC (BrC pri) and secondary BrC (BrC sec). The emissions of BC and BrCpri are mainly from fossil fuels combustion and biomass burning. BrCsec are predominantly produced through the secondary chemical processes in the atmosphere. BC and BrC affect the climate and the atmospheric environment through heating the atmosphere, darkening the cryosphere surface, and the melting of the glaciers and snow cover, and alteration of the clouds microphysical and optical properties. The previous studies reported that BC is the most efficient atmospheric light absorption component with a weak dependence on wavelength (λ). It is one of the important short-lived climate forcers, which has been considered as the contributor with the globally averaged radiative forcing of 1.2 W m −2 (including direct and indirect effects). BrC strongly absorbs short wavelengths at the solar spectrum of blue and ultraviolet (UV). The contribution of BrC to radiative forcing is ∼25% of the BC contribution on a planetary scale. At present, the scientific understanding of BrC is limited because its chemical components and light properties are complex, while the study of BC has been pursued in many areas. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), surrounded by the Eastern Asia and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, are influenced by either anthropogenic emissions or regional forest fires. The effects of BC and BrC aerosol are pronounced in the TP, which can darken the surface and consequently accelerate the melting of snow cover and glaciers."

A seven wavelengths Aethalometer was used to measure the light absorption (model AE33, λ = 370, 470, 520, 590, 660, 880, and 950 nm). The minimum R-squared method (MRS) was used for calculating BrCsec absorption at different wavelengths. The solar absorption contributions of BrCpri and BrCsec relative to those of BC in the northeastern, central, and southwestern TP were obtained by using the reported method. To assess the impact of regional transported BC and BrCpri in the TP, 5-day backward air-mass trajectories corresponding to each sampling date were calculated using the HYSPLIT model."

The relative radiative forcings of BrCsec to those of BC were much higher than BrCpri in the range of ultraviolet (300–400 nm).

                "AnswerEn": "The measurements were conducted by using a seven wavelengths Aethalometer to measure light absorption, and the minimum R-squared method was used to calculate secondary brown carbon absorption at different wavelengths. This approach helps in distinguishing between primary and secondary brown carbon across different regions of the Tibetan Plateau.",

This method helps in identifying major potential source distributions, such as pollution bands along the Indo-Gangetic Plain and pollution zones in northwestern China.",
                "AnswerCn": "为了评估区域运输的黑碳和初级棕色碳的影响，使用HYSPLIT模型计算了5天的后向气团轨迹。该方法有助于识别主要潜在源分布，例如印度-恒河平原沿线的污染带和中国西北部的污染区。",

                "AnswerEn": "Challenges include the scarcity of simultaneous measurements across various locations of the Tibetan Plateau. Addressing these challenges might involve deploying standardized measurement instruments like the Aethalometer across multiple sites and coordinating data collection schedules to ensure comprehensive spatial coverage. Additionally, employing models like HYSPLIT for back-trajectory analysis can help assess the impact of regional transport on measurement results.",
                "AnswerCn": "挑战包括在青藏高原各个地点同时测量的稀缺性。解决这些挑战可能涉及在多个地点部署标准化测量仪器，如Aethalometer，并协调数据收集时间表，以确保全面的空间覆盖。此外，采用HYSPLIT等模型进行后轨迹分析可以帮助评估区域运输对测量结果的影响。",

Strategies for dataset expansion may involve integrating data from pollution monitoring networks in adjacent high emission regions such as the Indo-Gangetic Plain and northwestern China, thereby enhancing understanding of pollution transport and its effects on the Plateau.",
                "AnswerCn": "潜在的数据来源可以包括在青藏高原的其他地点扩展测量活动，或使用遥感数据来补充地面观测。数据集扩展的策略可能涉及整合来自邻近高排放区域（如印度河平原和中国西北部）的污染监测网络的数据，从而增强对污染传播及其对高原影响的理解。",
