            "description": "1) Data content:\nThe paleomagnetic data can establish the paleomagnetic time frame of huatougou section, and the grain size, magnetic indexes and geochemical indexes can restore the climate change in geological history.\n2) Data sources and processing methods\nData sources are experimental data.\nPaleomagnetic data: 2x2x2 cm cylindrical samples were drilled with a small gasoline drill and measured in a magnetic shielding chamber with a cryogenic superconducting magnetometer.\nMagnetic data: The samples collected in the field were ground into fine particles in a 2x2x2 non-magnetic plastic box with a mortar, and tested with a Kapobridge magnetometer, pulse magnetometer and rotary magnetometer.\nGrain size data: Analysis of decomposed samples using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer. Prior to analysis, organic matter was removed with hot hydrogen peroxide and then carbonate was removed with hydrochloric acid in accordance with standard Procedures of Lanzhou University.\nGeochemical data: Take a small amount of samples to be pounded with agate mortar and ground into powder, and then sieve with a 200-mesh sieve to ensure that the samples meet test standards. After all the samples were ground and sifted, the samples were placed lightly in the groove of the slide and scraped to be flush with the surrounding slide. A PANalytical X 'Pert Pro MPD Polycrystal X-ray diffractometer was used as the test instrument.\n3) Data quality\nSample collection and experimental processing were carried out in accordance with strict standards, and the data obtained were of reliable quality.\n4) Data application achievements and prospects\nTwo SCI papers were published using these data, one of which was Ni.",

This is because such magnetometers are capable of detecting very weak magnetic signals, which is crucial for establishing a precise paleomagnetic age framework. As a result, the paleoclimate data derived from these measurements can more accurately reflect historical climate changes, leading to more robust scientific findings and insights.",

For magnetic data, field samples are ground into fine particles and placed in non-magnetic plastic boxes, then tested using a kappabridge magnetometer, pulse magnetometer, and rotational magnetometer. Grain size data is obtained by analyzing samples with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer, preceded by organic matter removal with hot hydrogen peroxide and carbonate removal with hydrochloric acid following standard procedures. For geochemical data, samples are crushed and ground into powder using an agate mortar, sieved through a 200-mesh sieve, and analyzed using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer.",
