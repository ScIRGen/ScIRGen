            "description": "Permafrost regions occupy about 46% of the exposed land area on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Permafrost is a hidden phenomenon that cannot be easily observed, and its distribution is hence heavily dependent on in-situ observations. Four methods are used to derive permafrost presence or absence over the TP, including borehole temperature, soil pit, ground surface temperature, and ground-penetrating radar surveys. There are a total of 626 sites of permafrost presence or absence contained in the inventory. In order to apply the permafrost presence or absence inventory more broadly, the degree of confidence in the data is estimated and provided in the inventory. The inventory provided a baseline for the presence or absence of pernmafrost at point scale on the TP, and could be additionally used for permafrost simulation evalution.",

The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), also known as the Third Pole, has the largest extent of permafrost in the low–middle latitudes. Permafrost over the QTP was reported to be sensitive to climate change mainly due to high ground temperature ( >−2 ◦C) (Wu and Zhang, 2008), and its distribution has strong influences on hydrological processes (e.g. Cheng and Jin, 2013; Zhang et al., 2018), biogeochemical processes (e.g. Mu et al., 2017), and human systems (e.g. Wu et al., 2016). Many approaches have been used to produce permafrost distribution and ground ice condition maps at different scales over the QTP (Ran et al., 2012). However, limited in situ measurements and the different classification systems and compilation approaches used make it challenging to compare maps directly. Despite the increasing efforts in mapping QTP permafrost, the maps have not been evaluated and inter-compared with the large amount of evidence of permafrost presence or absence."

It is more difficult to discern the presence of permafrost in areas with low soil moisture content because it weakens this contrast (Cao et al., 2017b)."

Current state-of-the-art land surface models include notable uncertainties in permafrost simulation, although significant progress has been made in coupling permafrost-specific physics over the last two decades. The permafrost zonation index (PZI) represents permafrost extent using a quantitative description (0.01–1) in spatial-continuous permafrost pattern, which is often lacking in the traditional binary maps. Rock glaciers (RGs) are unique periglacial features with high porosity, which can lead to cooling effects on ground temperature on the order of about 0.5 to more than 10°C depending upon the local conditions."

Point-scale permafrost presence and absence measurements were aggregated to a regular grid, co-registered with the unprojected SRTM30 grid (about 1 km pixel size). A 3-D statistical downscaling method was used to produce high-resolution (1-km) MAAT grids following Cao, Gruber, & Zhang (2017) and Cao et al. (2019b). The working hypothesis was tested in two ways. (1) Model comparison: since using the fundamental model with single predictor variable of MAAT is most amenable to comparison with published heuristic-empirical models, the statistical PZI model was treated as a PZI–MAAT relationship. MODRG and MODGT was derived using the RG- and GT-based permafrost presence/absence inventories, individually. We then compared MODRG with MODGT and the heuristic-empirical models.

                    "Answer": "The challenges in directly observing permafrost distribution on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau arise from permafrost being buried deep underground, making it hard to access through surface observations. This necessitates reliance on ground-based methods such as borehole investigations, soil temperature measurements, and ground-penetrating radar to gather permafrost distribution data.",

                    "Answer": "Existing permafrost maps face challenges due to limited in situ measurements and differing classification systems and compilation approaches. These factors make direct comparison of maps difficult, especially in areas with high spatial variability or low soil moisture, which weakens detection contrasts.",

                    "Answer": "The overestimation of permafrost extent using rock glacier observations in models is caused by the unique periglacial features of rock glaciers, which have high porosity and can lead to cooling effects on ground temperature. This results in a significant bias, particularly in discontinuous permafrost regions, where such models can overestimate permafrost presence by substantial margins compared to models using ground truth measurements.",

This inventory serves as a reference to improve and validate permafrost distribution mapping methods, which are influenced by various controlling factors at multiple scales.",

These techniques provide complementary data that enhance the accuracy and reliability of detecting permafrost distribution, especially in challenging landscapes where single-method approaches may not be sufficient.",

Addressing these challenges may involve enhancing data collection methods to include more comprehensive ground truth measurements and employing advanced statistical models or downscaling techniques to refine the spatial resolution and accuracy of permafrost maps.",

To improve mapping accuracy, it is suggested to integrate more controlling factors at both medium-large and local scales and to enhance the dataset by including additional observational data with higher spatial resolution. Improved mapping methods should also consider the variability in soil moisture content, which affects the discernibility of permafrost.",
