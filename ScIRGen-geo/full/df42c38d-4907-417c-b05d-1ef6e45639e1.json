            "description": "The dataset of  of potential glacial lakes (PGLs) distribution in the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding  (TPS) are vector data (. SHP). The data set contains the ID, area, perimeter, volume and elevation of each PGL. The TPS region was divided into 17 subregions based on the river basins’ borders, including 8 outflow river basins, i.e., the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, and Ob river basins, and 9 exorheic river basins, i.e., the Qiangtang, Hexi, Tarim, Qiadam, Junggar, Yili, Syr Darya, Amu Darya, and Mongolia river basins. This data is processed from theGlacier ice thickness distribution dataset (provided by Farinotti et al. (2019)). The grid difference between the initial DEM and the glacier ice thickness distribution was used to produce the DEM without glaciers. The overdeepenings were detected via two steps. First, we filled the depressions of the DEM without glaciers using a hydrology tool in the ArcGIS software. Second, using the filled DEM to subtract the DEM without glaciers, we ascertained the PGLs’ locations, areas, depths, and volumes. The quality of this data set depends on the quality of the original glacier thickness data, and the quality of the ice thickness dataset is the best of all similar data at present. The dataset of  of potential glacial lakes distribution in the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings can provide a new perspective from which to understand the future formation and evolution of glacial lakes in the TPS.  It is anticipated that approximately 16,000 PGLs areas of greater than 0.02 km2 will be formed in the TPS, covering an area of 2253.95 ± 1291.29 km2 and holding a water volume of 60.49 ± 28.94 km3, which would contribute to a 0.16 ± 0.08 mm equivalent sea-level rise.",

                    "Answer": "'Potential ice lake distribution' refers to the identification and mapping of areas where ice lakes may form in the future on the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions. This involves using vector data (.shp) to represent each potential ice lake's ID, area, perimeter, volume, and elevation. The data is derived from processing glacier thickness data to identify depressions under glaciers using ArcGIS software. This involves subtracting glacier thickness from the original DEM to create a glacier-free DEM, and using fill and excavation tools to extract depressions that could become ice lakes. The quality of this dataset depends on the original glacier thickness data, which is considered the best quality available among similar datasets.",

                    "Answer": "The potential inaccuracies in identifying and mapping potential glacial lakes in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas are primarily influenced by the quality of the original glacier thickness data. Since the dataset is derived from subtracting glacier thickness data from original DEMs using ArcGIS, any errors or limitations in the glacier thickness data provided by Farinotti et al. (2019) could lead to inaccuracies in the resultant potential ice-free DEM used to identify potential glacial lakes.",

                    "Answer": "The formation of potential ice lakes in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas could significantly alter regional hydrology, affecting water flow patterns in the 17 river basins, including major rivers like the Yellow River, Yangtze, and Mekong. The increase in ice lakes could lead to changes in water availability, risks of glacial lake outburst floods, and could contribute to sea level rise by approximately 0.16 ± 0.08 mm due to the additional water volume estimated at 60.49 ± 28.94 km3.",

Then, apply excavation tools to identify depressions located below the glacier beds, which represent potential ice lakes. This process relies on high-quality glacier thickness data, such as those provided by Farinotti et al. (2019), ensuring accurate identification of potential ice lake sites.",
