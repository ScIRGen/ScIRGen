            "description": "The data are monazite and zircon U-Pb ages. Three samples of carbonatite and pegmatite were collected (2018kl06 is carbonatite, 2018kl101 is tourmaline bearing pegmatite near carbonatite, 2018kl08-2 is beryl bearing pegmatite). After crushing, heavy sand minerals were separated by manual elutriation. After magnetic and electromagnetic separation, monazite (about 500 grains) and zircon (more than 1000 grains) were picked out under binocular lens. After selecting representative monazite as target, the internal structure of monazite was studied by BSE through microscope transmission light and reflection light photography. U-Pb chronology was completed on the 193 nm laser ablation system (new wave) and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in the laboratory of Tianjin Institute of Geology and mineral resources. In 2018kl06 carbonatite, the intersection age of the reverse inconsistency line of 17 test points is 18.2 ± 0.3 Ma, while the average age of 9 test points with complete harmony is 18.15 ± 0.22 Ma; The monazite of sample 2018kl101 obtained 15 measuring points with concordance greater than 90%, and the average age is 19.39 ± 0.36 Ma; The average age of 20 zircon sites of sample 2018kl08-2 is 197.5 ± 1.4 ma. They are Cenozoic and Mesozoic (19 ~ 18 Ma and 200 MA), respectively. The early beryl bearing pegmatite was formed in the extension stage after the closure of the paleoTethys ocean, while the Cenozoic bastnaesite carbonatite pegmatite assemblage is related to the Cenozoic intracontinental strike slip extension event, indicating that the extension strike slip of Pamir structural junction may start at 19 ma. Combined with the characteristics of regional geochemical anomalies, it shows that a breakthrough in rare and light rare earth prospecting is expected in Pamir area.",

                    "Answer": "The U-Pb age data suggests that the early beryl-bearing pegmatites formed during the extensional phase following the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, indicating a Mesozoic era around 200 Ma. The combination of fluorocarbonate mineral-bearing carbonatite and pegmatite in the Cenozoic era (19-18 Ma) is related to intracontinental strike-slip extension events, suggesting that the initiation of the Pamir tectonic knot's extensional strike-slip might have occurred around 19 Ma. Coupled with regional geochemical anomalies, these findings indicate potential breakthroughs in the exploration of rare and light rare earth elements in the Pamir region.",

                    "Answer": "The U-Pb dating method is chosen due to its reliability in providing precise age determinations for minerals like monazite and zircon, which contain uranium. This method helps in understanding the geological history and timing of events, such as the formation of rare metal pegmatite-carbonatite complexes, which are linked to significant tectonic activities like the extensional events in the Pamir region during the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras.",

                    "Answer": "Using U-Pb dating techniques on monazite and zircon collected from rare metal pegmatite-carbonatite samples can reveal the age of geological formations and the timing of significant tectonic events. For instance, it can help identify the new Cenozoic and Mesozoic geological ages (19~18 Ma and 200 Ma) and determine the timing of tectonic extensions related to the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and the initiation of extensional strike-slip events in the Pamir region around 19 Ma, which is crucial for understanding the geodynamic history and potential rare-earth element mineralization in the area.",

Specifically, the data help to understand the timing of the extension events related to the closure of the Paleotethys Ocean and the initiation of intracontinental extensional events in the Pamir tectonic knot, as well as to assess the potential for discovering rare and light rare earth elements in the area.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps for collecting and analyzing U-Pb age data for monazite and zircon involve several stages. Initially, samples are collected from carbonatite and pegmatite, specifically labeled as 2018KL06, 2018KL101, and 2018KL08-2. These samples undergo crushing and manual panning to separate heavy minerals. Magnetic and electromagnetic separation is then performed, after which monazite (about 500 grains) and zircon (more than 1000 grains) are handpicked under a binocular microscope. Representative monazite grains are mounted for target preparation and examined using transmitted and reflected light microscopy. The internal structure of the monazite is studied using Back-Scattered Electron (BSE) imaging. U-Pb geochronology is conducted at the Tianjin Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources using a 193 nm laser ablation system (New Wave) and a multi-receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Analysis provided reverse discordia intercept ages and concordant age averages for different sample points, revealing both Cenozoic and Mesozoic formation ages, which are connected to regional tectonic events. The findings suggest potential for exploration of rare and light rare earth elements in the Pamir region, correlating with specific geological events.",

This technology allows for detailed age determination by analyzing individual grains, providing insights into the timing of geological events such as the formation of rare metal-bearing pegmatites and carbonatites.",
