            "description": "Based on the 33rd Antarctic Scientific Expedition in China, the data set of temporal and spatial distribution of metal element concentrations in snow and ice obtained on the section from Zhongshan Station to Dome A in East Antarctica mainly includes: 1. A shallow ice core obtained 202 km away from Zhongshan Station. The ice core covers the period from 1990 to 2017 with a resolution of years, including metal element iron, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and other data. 2. Collect a sample every 10km along the Zhongshan Station Dome A section in East Antarctica. The metal elements include rare earth elements, barium and other elements. The data can be used to study the pollution and contribution of natural sources and human activities to Antarctic snow and ice.",

                "Iron bioavailability is taken as a limit factor for primary productivity in approximately 40% of the world’s oceans. A significant external iron source to the open ocean is the atmospheric input and particularly the atmospheric deposition of mineral dust from continental regions. Volcanic events, continental shelf and iceberg are also important Fe sources. Therefore, it is still not clear which one is much more important for primary productivity in the Southern Ocean, although the Fe hypothesis has been demonstrated on three High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the surface ocean where today vanishingly-low dissolved Fe concentrations limit phytoplankton growth. In particular, the magnitude of the bioavailable Fe controls how much the atmospheric CO2 changes during glacial-interglacial cycles, which is very uncertainly. Many dissolved Fe data in seawater from the international GEOTRACES program have been published to elucidate the distributions of Fe in seawater at the global scale. This greatly increases our knowledge of the marine geochemistry of Fe element, however, it is still limited ice core Fe data for paleoclimate study. Recent work also suggests that Fe fertilization likely accounts for 5 to 30 ppmv of the change in the CO2 concentrations observed over glacial-interglacial transitions in Antarctica ice cores. More importantly, with global warming, the ice melting of Greenland ice sheet may release much more bioavailable Fe to the ocean."

The aeolian dust may be the primary DFe source during 1990–2017. In particular, the DFe variations may be affected by the biomass burning emissions in two periods (1990–1998 and 2014–2017). While total dissolved Fe (TDFe) variations were controlled by the climatic conditions since 2000 because of the temperature (d18O) decreasing at East Antarctica. These Fe data will be useful to assess the modern bioavailable Fe release for the Antarctica ice sheet."
