                "Understanding the factors that influence the distribution of understory vegetation is important for biological conservation and forest management. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the species composition and diversity of understory flora can be influenced by canopy species and structure, stand management, ground disturbances, light resources, litter properties, and soil nutrients and pH. Topography can also significantly alter microclimates and resource availability under the tree canopy and in turn influence understory species composition and diversity. Understory vegetation in coniferous forests, hardwood forests, and mixed-wood forests has been well studied, and the latter two forest types are widely accepted to be more favorable to biodiversity than coniferous forests. Natural forest patches that are dominated by Picea crassifolia Kom. and Sabina przewalskii Kom. are widely distributed in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China. These forests are important for water conservation and preventing soil erosion in this region."

                "We hypothesized that understory species composition would differ significantly between them and that juniper forest would have a more diversified understory plant community than spruce forest, because Picea species generally support fewer understory species than Pinus and Larix. Additionally, we tried to determine the extent to which topographic variables and site conditions could explain the variation in understory species composition of coniferous forests."

                "We compared understory species composition by multi-response permutation procedure and indicator species analysis between plots dominated by Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) and Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.) in coniferous forests of the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China. Using constrained ordination and the variation partitioning model, we quantitatively assessed the relative effects of two sets of explanatory variables on understory species composition. Forward selection revealed that understory species distributions were primarily affected by elevation and aspect. We established 27 plots of 20×20m for vegetation survey at elevations ranging from 2660m to 3480m; 16 plots were in spruce forest and 11 plots in juniper forest. Within each plot, trees >5.0cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were individually surveyed for DBH and height. Total tree basal area per plot was calculated. Each 20×20m plot was subdivided into four 10×10m quadrats, three of which were randomly selected to survey shrub species. Herbaceous species were investigated within five 1×1m quadrats, one in the center and four at the corners of the 20×20m plot. Elevation, aspect, slope, and slope position of each plot were recorded using a GPS and a compass meter. Five topsoil samples (0–10cm depth) were randomly collected in each plot with a stainless steel cylindrical soil sampler of 5cm in diameter."

                "Understory species composition differed markedly between the forest types. Many heliophilous species were significantly associated with juniper forest, while only one species was indicative of spruce forest. The results showed that topographic variables had higher explanatory power than did site conditions for understory plant distributions. Juniper forest had higher species richness and α-diversity and lower β-diversity in the herb layer of the understory plant community than spruce forest, suggesting that the former may be more important in maintaining understory biodiversity and community stability in alpine coniferous forest ecosystems."

                    "Answer": "Differences in species richness and diversity between juniper and spruce forests may be due to the higher explanatory power of topographic variables over site conditions, as well as the propensity of juniper forests to support more heliophilous species and thus maintain higher species richness and α-diversity compared to spruce forests.",
