                "Investigating long-term drought trends is of great importance in coping with the adverse effects of global warming. Several recent studies have suggested that ongoing warming is accelerating evaporation and creating more spatiotemporal heterogeneity in precipitation than in the past. China is home to multiple climate zones that host important agricultural regions and other societally important activities that are likely to be affected by increased drought. Several indexes have been employed to investigate long-term drought, including the standardized precipitation index, the Palmer drought severity index, and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Unlike the standardized precipitation index, the SPEI considers changes in both the precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration induced by temperature. The SPEI also allows for multiple temporal scales, unlike the Palmer drought severity index."

Of the 27 GCMs analyzed, the BNU-ESM, CESM1-CAM5, and GFDL-ESM2M were found to be the most accurate in modeling future temperatures and precipitation. We also found that, compared with the past (1901–2017), the climate in the future (2018–2100) will tend toward significant droughts, although both periods showed a high spatial heterogeneity across China. Moreover, the proportion of areas with significantly decreasing SPEI trends was far greater than the proportion of those with increasing trends in most cases, especially for northwestern and northern China. Finally, the proposed approach to quantifying precipitation and PET contributions performed well according to logical evaluations. Overall, our results provide detailed insights for planning flexible adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with the adverse effects of climate drought across China."

                "High-spatial-resolution and long-term climate data are required for accurate investigations of changes in climate and climate-related phenomena that affect hydrology, vegetation cover, and crop production. Although meteorological observation networks are increasingly incorporating data from a greater number of weather stations and contributions from an increasing number of governments and researchers around the world, observation networks still suffer from low station density and spatial resolution, especially in mountainous areas, where the installation and maintenance of weather stations are challenging. Proxy monthly temperature (TMP) and precipitation (PRE) data products are released by several climate research organizations such as the general circulation models (GCMs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), and Willmott & Matsuura (W&M). Although CRU products offer the advantage of reflecting long-term climate effects, their low spatial resolution (30′, approximately 55 km) limits their ability to reflect the effects of complex topographies, land surface characteristics, and other processes on climate systems. China has a large area with abundant mountainous regions. As a result, even the establishment of additional weather stations has not fully satisfied the requirements for long-term, high-spatial-resolution climate data, especially at finer geographical scales and for mountainous areas. Furthermore, most weather stations in China were established after 1950, and thus long-term observational climate data are lacking."
