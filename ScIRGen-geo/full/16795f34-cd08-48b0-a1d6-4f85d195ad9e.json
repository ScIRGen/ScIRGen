            "description": "Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is fundamental physiological variable driving the process of material and energy exchange, and is indispensable for researches in ecological and agricultural fields. In this study, we produced a 35-year (1984-2018) high-resolution (3 h, 10 km) global grided PAR dataset with an effective physical-based PAR model. The main inputs were cloud optical depth from the latest International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) H-series cloud products, the routine variables (water vapor, surface pressure and ozone) from the ERA5 reanalysis data, aerosol from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) products and albedo from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product after 2000 and CLARRA-2 product before 2000. The grided PAR products were evaluated against surface observations measured at seven experimental stations of the SURFace RADiation budget network (SURFRAD), 42 experimental stations of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and 38 experimental stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN). The instantaneous PAR was validated at the SURFRAD and NEON, and the mean bias errors (MBEs) and root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 5.6 W m-2 and 44.3 W m-2, and 5.9 W m-2 and 45.5 W m-2, respectively, and correlation coefficients (R) are both 0.94 at 10 km scale. When averaged to 30 km, the errors were obviously reduced with RMSEs decreasing to 36.3 W m-2 and 36.3 W m-2 and R both increasing to 0.96. The daily PAR was validated at the SURFRAD, NEON and CERN, and the RMSEs were 13.2 W m-2, 13.1 W m-2 and 19.6 W m-2, respectively at 10 km scale. The RMSEs were slightly reduced to 11.2 W m-2, 11.6 W m-2, and 18.6 W m-2 when upscaled to 30 km. Comparison with the other well-known global satellite-based PAR product of the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) reveals that our PAR product was a more accurate dataset with higher resolution than the CRERS. Our grided PAR dataset would contribute to the ecological simulation and food yield assessment in the future.",

                "Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is a fundamental physiological variable for research in the ecological, agricultural, and global change fields. Plants rely on chlorophyll to absorb solar radiation in the visible wavelength range (400–700 nm) for photosynthesis, and sunlight in this band is commonly referred to as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Thus, PAR is the source of energy for biomass formation and may directly affect the growth, development, yield, and product quality of vegetation, modulating energy exchange between the earth’s surface and the atmosphere. Therefore, a high-quality PAR dataset is indispensable for studies of ecosystems, agriculture, and global change; however, measurements of PAR are not routinely conducted at weather stations or radiation stations. Long-term PAR observations are only provided by a few ecological experimental observation networks, such as the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN), the AmeriFlux network, the SURFace RADiation budget network (SURFRAD), and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). To compensate for the lack of PAR observations, a number of methods have been developed over recent decades to estimate PAR. These methods can be roughly divided into two categories: station-based methods and satellite-based methods."
