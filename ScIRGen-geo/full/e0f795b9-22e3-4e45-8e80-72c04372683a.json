            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in No. 2 and 3 quadrates of the A'rou foci experimental area on Mar. 14, 2008.\n     The Envisat ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 23:21 BJT. The quadrates were divided into 4×4 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. Only the corner points of each subsite were chosen for observations. Those provide reliable ground data for retrieval and verification of soil moisture from active remote sensing approaches.\n     In No. 2 quadrate, simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected, the soil temperature, soil volumetric moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, and the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the surface radiative temperature measured three times by the hand-held infrared thermometer, soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3). \n     In No. 3 quadrate, simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected, the soil temperature, soil volumetric moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, and the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity by the POGO soil sensor, soil volumetric moisture by ML2X, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the surface radiative temperature measured three times by the hand-held infrared thermometer, soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3). \n     Surface roughness was detailed in the \"WATER: Surface roughness dataset in the A'rou foci experimental area\".",
