            "description": "This data is the runoff and evapotranspiration generated by the precipitation in the growing season of the upper reaches of Heihe River from 1992 to 2015. Temporal resolution: year (growingseason), spatial resolution: 0.00833°. The data include precipitation (mm), evapotranspiration (mm), runoff (mm) and soil water content (m3 / m3). The data are obtained by using meteorological, soil and vegetation parameters based on Eagleson eco hydrological model. The simulated rainfall runoff is verified by using the observed runoff data in the growing season of 6 sub basins in the upper reaches of Heihe River (Heihe main stream, Babao River, yeniugou, Liyuan River, Wafangcheng and Hongshui River). The variation range of correlation coefficient (R) is 0.53-0.74, RMSE is 32.46-233.18 mm, and the relative error range is -0.66-0.0005; The difference between simulated evapotranspiration and gleam et is − 115.36 mm to 44.1 mm. The simulation results can provide some reference for hydrological simulation in the upper reaches of Heihe River.",

In this context, it is used to generate data for hydrological studies in the upper reaches of the Heihe River, with the results validated against observed runoff data from multiple sub-basins.",

The validation shows a correlation coefficient range of 0.53-0.74, RMSE between 32.46-233.18 mm, and relative error from -0.66 to -0.0005, indicating the model's potential for providing reference data for hydrological simulations in this region.",

                    "Answer": "The variance in precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff data can help researchers understand the dynamics of the water cycle by indicating how seasonal and long-term changes affect water availability. The data, collected from 1992 to 2015 with a focus on growing seasons in the upper reaches of the Heihe River, provide insights into the interaction between meteorological factors and hydrological responses. The use of the Eagleson ecohydrological model and validation against observed runoff data from six sub-basins allows for interpretation of these patterns, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.53 to 0.74, and relative errors spanning -0.66 to -0.0005. These patterns can indicate how climatic variables and land characteristics influence hydrological processes and can be used to inform future water resource management and ecological conservation strategies.",

                    "Answer": "The discrepancies could stem from the limitations of the Eagleson ecohydrological model used for simulations, variations in meteorological, soil, and vegetation parameters, and the inherent challenges in capturing complex hydrological processes accurately. Additionally, differences in the spatial and temporal resolutions of input data and the validation process using observational data from various sub-basins with different characteristics may also contribute to such discrepancies.",

There could also be discrepancies in simulated versus observed evapotranspiration, with differences ranging from −115.36 mm to 44.1 mm when compared to GLEAM ET data. Such outcomes highlight the importance of model validation against local observational data to ensure accuracy and reliability.",

This is achieved by simulating using the Eagleson ecological hydrological model with meteorological, soil, and vegetation parameters. The simulated rainfall runoff is validated against observed runoff data from six sub-basins in upstream Heihe during the growing season. These simulations aim to provide reference data for hydrological modeling in upstream Heihe.",
