            "description": "The animal and plant remains unearthed from archaeological sites are important materials to understand and understand the relationship between ancient humans and animals and plants, restore the ancient human lifestyle and economic basis, and reveal the development process and dynamic mechanism of human culture. Systematic animal Archaeology and plant archaeology analysis were carried out on the jijunbu site in the early Holocene and the Zongri site in the middle and late Holocene in the northeast of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The analysis of 11 animal fossils in jijunbu showed that ancient humans in the northeast of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau mainly hunted large and medium herbivorous mammals during the last interglacial period. The charcoal analysis results of Zongri site show that the ancestors of Zongri site widely collected the surrounding spruce, poplar and seabuckthorn as fuel.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of specific animal and plant archaeological analysis methods at the Jiǎngjùnbù and Zōngrì sites likely stems from the need to understand the interactions between ancient humans and their environment. For Jiǎngjùnbù, the analysis of 11 animal fossils from the last interglacial period suggests a focus on studying the hunting practices of ancient humans, particularly their targeting of large and medium-sized herbivorous mammals. Meanwhile, the charcoal analysis at the Zōngrì site indicates a focus on understanding how ancient inhabitants utilized local resources such as spruce, poplar, and sea buckthorn for fuel, which provides insights into their resource management and environmental adaptation strategies.",
