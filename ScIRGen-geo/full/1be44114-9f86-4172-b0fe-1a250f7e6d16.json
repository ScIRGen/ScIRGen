            "description": "1) Data content\nIce-free evaporation data of three typical mesoscale inland lakes (Bamu Co, Langa Co and Longmu Co) from 2019 to 2023. The location of the lake: Bamu Co (90.59°E, 31.29°N), Langa Co (81.24°E, 30.72°N), Longmu Co (80.47°E, 34.60°N).\nTime resolution: 1d; 1 month\nUnit: mm\n2) Data calculation method\nWater balance method. The calculation formula is as follows:\nE = P + R - ΔV (1)\nWhere E is evaporation, P is precipitation, R is runoff discharge, and ΔV is the change of lake water volume.\nAll the data used were calculated by in-situ observation data and satellite remote sensing data. Where P uses lakeside rain bucket data and GPM data; R Using radar current meters at major runoff locations, periodic manual flow measurements, and ERA-GloFAS datasets; ΔV uses the data of automatic water level meter 1 meter from the lake to obtain the water level change, and the monthly area change obtained from Sentinel-2 data can be calculated. The calculation formula is as follows:\nΔV=1/3 (H_2-H_1)(A_1+A_2+√(A_1×A_2)) (2)\nΔV=(H_2-H_1)A (3)\nH1, H2, A1 and A2 are the water level and lake area in different periods, respectively. When calculating the monthly change of water quantity, formula (2) is used. When calculating the daily change of water quantity, the lake area A of the current month is used because the daily change of lake area is small and can be ignored.\n3) Data quality description\nThe water balance method requires a large number of meteorological and hydrological observation parameters, especially for the observation of runoff recharge, there are many uncertain factors. In this dataset, the recharge amount of underground runoff is not taken into account, and the surface runoff recharge is also difficult to observe. Therefore, the dataset obtained by this method needs to be further updated with the increase of observation data, so as to obtain more accurate data as far as possible.\n4) Data application achievements and prospects\nSurface evaporation is an important link in the water cycle and an important subject in hydrology. The advantage of using water balance method to calculate evaporation is that it can be applied under any weather conditions without being restricted by many conditions in micrometeorology. Under the condition of sufficient and reliable data, using water balance method to calculate evaporation can produce data with high precision. The more accurate evaporation amount obtained from the observed data is an important link in the study of lake water variation. By obtaining the evaporation amount of three lakes in different climate zones, the variation law of lake surface evaporation in different climate zones can be better explored.\nSee the file for specific data content <Data summary.docx>\n\n",

Understanding the changes to lake water volume is a key issue for the study of lake-atmosphere interactions and the effects of lake expansion and contraction on regional climate. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has an average elevation of over 4000 m. This region is known as the \"Asian Water Tower\" as it contains numerous lakes, covering a total area of 5 ×10^4 km^2 in 2018, and is the birthplace of many large rivers. Most lakes on the TP are in a natural state and are relatively unaffected by human activities."

(3) The monthly variation of lake water volume showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, with the largest relative change of lake water volume in August and September. (4) Precipitation is a dominant factor controlling lake variation during the year.
