      "description": "Naked barley, called highland barley in Tibet, is the main crop of the Tibetan plateau and the main food of the Tibetan people. It has a long planting history, the largest planting area, the widest distribution and the highest planting ceiling. As for the autonomous region, the annual sown area and total grain output account for more than half of the total sown area and total grain output. In river valleys below 4,200 meters, they account for 30-50% of the area sown to local crops. In the alpine farming area of 4,200-4,500 meters above sea level, it accounts for 70-90% of the planting area of local crops. Naked barley is almost the only crop at agricultural sites above 4,500 meters. Tibetan bare barley has strong cold and drought resistance and ADAPTS to the plateau climate conditions. It is distributed in the vast agricultural areas and farming-pastoral interlacing areas from more than 1,000 meters to 4,500 meters above sea level. At present, the upper limit of planting reaches 4750 meters, which is the highest limit of crop distribution in Tibet. In 1974, a comprehensive scientific expedition to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau entered Tibet from Sichuan province and carried out investigations along the route. During a survey of wild barley in Jitang district, Chaya County, Qamdo region, Tibetan members provided information about semi-wild wheat, which is similar to wheat in morphology but has broken cob at maturity, and is generally mixed with highland barley and wheat fields as a field weed. Plant specimens and seeds were collected. When the expedition team arrived at the Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology of Tibet Autonomous Region, they learned that comrades Cheng Tianqing and Dong Yuao had collected a kind of wheat with broken cob at maturity in SAN 'an Qu Lin, Longzi County, Shannan Prefecture in 1962, which belonged to the same type as the materials we had collected in other areas of Tibet. Later, in the Xigaze regional agricultural research institute, Comrade Tan Changhua said that he had also seen this kind of wheat when the cob broke at maturity in Renbu County. In addition to the above areas, this wild wheat was also found near Jiacha county, Gongga County and Longzi County in Shannan during this year's investigation. Currently known distribution areas include lancang River basin, Yarlung Zangbo River basin and Longzi River basin.",
      "descriptionCn": "裸大麦，西藏称青稞，它是西藏高原的主要农作物，藏族人民的主要食粮。其种植历史悠久，播种面积最大，分布范围最广，种植上限最高。就全自治区而言，常年的播种面积和总产量都占作物总播种面积和粮食总产量的一半以上。在海拔4200米以下的河谷地区，占当地作物播种面积的30—50%。在海拔4200—4500米的高寒农区，占当地作物播种面积的70—90%。在海拔4500米以上的农业点，裸大麦几乎是唯一的农作物。西藏裸大麦具有较强的耐寒、耐旱性，适应高原气候条件，自海拔1000多米至4500米左右广大的农区、农牧交错区都有分布，目前种植的上限达到4750米，是西藏作物分布的最高上限。1974年青藏高原综合科学考察队从四川进藏，沿途进行了线路考察。在昌都地区察雅县吉塘区调查野生大麦时，藏族社员提供了半野生小麦的情况，它是一种在形态上很象小麦，而在成熟时穗轴断裂的一种小麦，一般是做为田间杂草混杂在青稞与小麦田间。采集了植株标本和种子。当考察队到达西藏自治区农科所时，得知自治区农科所程天庆、董玉鳌同志1962年曾在山南地区隆子县三安曲林采集到一种成熟时穗轴折断的小麦，它和我们在西藏其它地区采集到的材料同属于一个类型。随后，在日喀则地区农科所，谭昌华同志讲他在仁布县也看到过这种在成熟时穗轴折断的小麦。除了上述地区，这一年的考察中，还在山南加查县、贡嘎县、隆子县附近发现了这种野生小麦。目前已知的分布地区包括了澜沧江流域，雅鲁藏布江流域和隆子河流域。",
