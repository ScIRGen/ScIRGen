            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in No. 1 and 2 quadrates of the Biandukou foci experimental area on Oct. 18, 2007, during the pre-observation period.\n     The ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 11:17 BJT. Both the quadrates were divided into 3×3 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. 25 sampling points were chosen, including centers and corners.\n     Simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected: the soil temperature , volumetric soil moisture (cm^3/cm^3), soil salinity (s/m), soil conductivity (s/m) by the Hydra probe, the surface radiative temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer, gravimetric soil moisture, volumetric soil moisture, and soil bulk density by drying soil samples from the cutting ring (100cm^3). Meanwhile, vegetation parameters as height, coverage and water content were also observed. \n     Those provide reliable ground data for the development and validation of soil moisture, soil freeze/thaw algorithms and the forward model from active remote sensing approaches.",

This involves conducting field experiments and measurements on the ground at the same time as a satellite passes overhead, ensuring that the data collected from both sources can be directly compared or integrated. In this field, ground synchronous observations were conducted using various instruments to measure soil temperature, soil moisture, soil salinity, soil conductivity, and surface radiation temperature, alongside satellite data from Envisat ASAR.",

Ground-based instruments like Hydra probes measure soil temperature, volumetric water content, soil salinity, and conductivity, while handheld infrared thermometers capture surface radiation temperature. Additionally, soil samples are collected using 100cm^3 rings for further analysis of moisture content and density, which enable detailed soil property measurements.
