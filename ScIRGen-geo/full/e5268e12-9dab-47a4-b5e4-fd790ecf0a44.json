            "description": "The collision of Lhasa Qiangtang terrane and its subsequent tectonic evolution are considered to be the most important event in the Tibetan Plateau before the Cenozoic India Asia collision. In view of this scientific problem, through the study of the late Cretaceous granite in Anduo area of Qiangtang terrane, the following achievements and understandings have been obtained. Zircon U-Pb geochronology, major and trace geochemistry and Sr Nd isotopic analysis have been carried out for the chuburi granite. The zircon U-Pb results of the two samples show that they were formed at 73-74 ma. The geochemical data show that the magmatic rocks have high contents of SiO2, K2O, Na2O, Al2O3 and total alkali, belonging to the high-k calc alkaline granite series. The normalized REE map of chondrite and the normalized trace element map of primitive mantle show that the magmatic rocks are characterized by enrichment of LREE and hree, enrichment of large ion lithophile elements and depletion of high field strength elements. Based on the analysis of petrological, petrographic and geochemical data, combined with the regional geological data, it is considered that the chuburi magmatic rock was formed by different degrees of mixed melt of mantle derived magma and lower crust derived melt, and then experienced the obvious separation and crystallization process of potash feldspar, plagioclase and other minerals. The formation of chuburi magmatic rocks is related to the delamination of lithosphere after the collision of Lhasa Qiangtang terrane",

In the context of studying late Cretaceous granites in central Tibet, it involves analyzing zircon minerals within the granite samples to establish their crystallization age, which was found to be 73-74 Ma for the samples mentioned. This method provides insights into the timing of geological events, such as magmatic processes and tectonic activities associated with the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision and subsequent evolution.",

                    "Answer": "The elemental composition and isotopic data of granitic rocks can provide insights into the mixing processes of mantle-derived magmas and melts from the lower crust. The high SiO2, K2O, Na2O, Al2O3, and alkali content indicate a high-potassium calc-alkaline granite series, suggesting significant mantle-crust interactions. The enrichment of light rare earth elements and large-ion lithophile elements, along with the depletion of high-field-strength elements, also supports the idea of mantle involvement and subsequent crustal melting and differentiation processes. This data can infer that these processes are related to lithospheric delamination following the Lhasa-Qiangtang terrane collision.",

                    "Answer": "Variability in geochemical and isotopic data collection could be influenced by several factors, including the heterogeneity of the source materials, the extent of mixing between mantle-derived magma and lower crustal melts, and the degree of fractional crystallization involving minerals like potassium feldspar and plagioclase. Additionally, regional tectonic events such as the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision and subsequent lithospheric delamination could also impact data consistency.",
