The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient reached 95.00% and 0.95, respectively. The data includes vegetation maps of the Tibetan Plateau (in TIFF format, 4 periods, each spanning 10 years ), classification, and post-processing codes. This dataset can provide a basis for dynamic monitoring of vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau.",
