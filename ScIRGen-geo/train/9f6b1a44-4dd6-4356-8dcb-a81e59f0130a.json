            "description": "The Landsat cloud-free image of the middle Yarlung Zangbo River basin in the autumn of 1990-2020 was obtained by using Google Earth Engine platform. Based on the object-oriented combined classification method, the desertification land was fully recognized and extracted. The overall accuracy of the classification results was as high as 91.38%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.82. From 1990 to 2020, the land desertification in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River showed a continuous downward trend. The total area of sandy land decreased by 194.72 km2, with an average annual reduction rate of 6.49 km2/a. The area of sandy land continued to decrease, indicating that the measures for sand prevention and control and ecological restoration in the region had achieved remarkable results. This data set can provide basic data for assessing the effectiveness of regional land desertification control, and further service the prevention and control of land desertification in the central Yarlung Zangbo River basin.",

                "Desertiﬁcation is one of the most serious eco-environmental and socio-economic problems, receiving considerable attention. Sandy land is deﬁned as the land that has lost its vegetation and wildlife, as well as bodies of water, that occurs in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-mid zones. Once land is converted into sandy land, restoration and rehabilitation is diﬃcult and it poses big pressures on land erosion and related disasters. The decrease in land quality from desertiﬁcation has signiﬁcant impacts on the sustainable development of the eco-environment and human society. As the political, economic and social center of the Xizang area, the middle part of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB), runs through the southern region of the Qingzang Plateau from west to east and has suﬀered serious desertiﬁcation in recent decades. Widespread sandy lands impact agricultural, social and economic activities in the region resulting in cropland degradation, sand storms and water shortages. This phenomenon is enhanced by vulnerability to water and wind erosion due to the shape and topography of the river valley and prevailing monsoon winds. Therefore, it is critical to derive high-quality, reliable and long-term sandy land data to dynamically monitor desertiﬁcation, quantitatively analyze the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics, and provide a scientiﬁc basis for environmental protection and sustainable development. At present there are numerous methods for acquiring desertiﬁcation information that focus on ﬁeld investigations and remote sensing. Compared with ﬁeld investigations, remote sensing methods have been widely used to monitor the spatio-temporal information of desertiﬁcation because of their large spatial coverage, easy accessibility and reasonable costs."

To build the classification method and evaluate accuracy, two datasets were used: sampling points collected from Google Earth images; and field survey data. Based on the high-resolution historical images from Google Earth, we selected 301 sampling points, belonging to sandy land (124 points) and non-sandy land (177 points). Field survey data were collected from field investigations from May 13th to May 17th 2020, containing 299 points (123 sandy land points and 176 non-sandy land points)."

Sandy land tends to be distributed in the southern aspect regions with lower elevations and that are closer to rivers; (2) sandy land areas showed two temporal stages: a gradual increase of 102.4 km² from 1995 to 2015 and a large decrease of 106.8 km² from 2015 to 2019; (3) newly increased sandy land was distributed in the YZR Valley, while the revegetation on sandy land occurred mainly in the Lhasa River basin and some regions in the YZR Valley; and (4) increased sandy land area of 142.1 km² was mainly distributed in the southern band of the two rivers. Correspondingly, revegetation on sandy land was more effective on the northern banks of the river valleys. These ﬁndings provide guidance for implementing vegetation recovery on sandy lands and provide important insights for maintaining sustainable development."
