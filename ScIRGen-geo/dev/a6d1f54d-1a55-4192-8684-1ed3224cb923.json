            "description": "Data source: tabular data in comprehensive investigation series of Kekexili area. This paper summarizes the strata of xijinwulan belt, Kekexili area and Tanggula area in the northern slope of Tanggula Mountain. Based on the previous regional geological survey results and the paper \"Introduction to the geology of Kekexili and its adjacent areas in Qinghai\", this paper is based on the paleontological, stratigraphic and structural characteristics. From south to north, qingkekexili area can be divided into four different stratigraphic and structural divisions: xijinwulan belt in Tanggula area, Kekexili area and East Kunlun area. Tanggula area and xijinwulan zone, East Kunlun area and Kekexili area are separated by the northern margin of Tanggula Mountain and the southern margin of East Kunlun Mountain respectively, while the boundary between xijinwulan zone and Kekexili area is roughly on the north side of xijinwulan and the north slope of Fenghuoshan.",

                    "Answer": "Stratigraphic division is crucial in geological research as it involves categorizing layers of rock based on age, composition, and other characteristics. In regions like Qinghai Kekexili, it aids in understanding the geological history and structural composition, which can inform data collection methods by identifying specific areas for sampling and investigation. Stratigraphic division helps researchers focus on significant geological formations and ensures comprehensive data collection across different geological sections.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for stratigraphic division in the Qinghai Kekexili region involve comprehensive geological surveys that consider paleontological, stratigraphic, and structural characteristics. These methods are similar to those used in adjacent regions such as the Tanggula and East Kunlun areas, where boundaries are defined by significant geological features like the northern edge of the Tanggula mountains and the southern edge of the East Kunlun mountains. The comparison highlights that while the fundamental approach of using geological surveys is consistent, the specific focus on different geological formations and boundary delineations can vary based on regional geological characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity in stratigraphic division and correlation in the Qinghai Hoh Xil region and its neighboring areas arises from the diverse stratigraphic and structural characteristics, such as the presence of distinct divisions like the Tanggula area, Xijinwulan belt, Hoh Xil area, and East Kunlun area. These divisions are based on paleontological, stratigraphic, and structural features. The boundaries defined by geographical features like the northern edge of the Tanggula Mountains and the southern edge of the East Kunlun Mountains further complicate the stratigraphic correlation.",

                    "Answer": "Enhancing data collection using more comprehensive stratigraphic and paleontological methods could lead to a more detailed and accurate understanding of the regional geological formations. It would allow for a more precise subdivision of the areas into distinct stratigraphic and structural regions, better comparison with neighboring regions, and improved insights into the geological history and tectonic evolution of the Kekexili area and its adjacent regions. This could also facilitate more informed decisions in regional planning and management of geological resources.",
