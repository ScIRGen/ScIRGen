            "description": "The data consist of two parts: AMS data of the Dayunshan-Mufushan pluton and 40Ar-39Ar ages of biotite, amphibole and Muscovite in the granitic mylonite and mica schist in the southern margin of the pluton. In the field, a portable gasoline drill was used to collect rock core columns, and then the samples were cut into standard columns with a diameter of 2.5 cm and a height of 2.2 cm indoor. The final test was completed in the paleomagnetism Laboratory of Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The 40Ar-39Ar dating of minerals mainly includes the following steps. Firstly, the rock samples were cleaned and crushed, and then the biotite particles were selected by hand under the binocular microscope. Before preparing for dating, biotite was reexamined and fresh, transparent and inclusion free crystals were selected. The experiments were carried out in the Key Laboratory of Geology and Geophysics, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and in the 40Ar / 39Ar and U-Th / he laboratories. Mm5400 mass spectrometer was used to measure 40Ar / 39Ar with high resolution. Then, arcalc, a plug-in of Excel, is used to further process the original data. The data provide chronological support for the interpretation of emplacement process and dynamic mechanism of dayunshan Mufushan pluton.\nThe above data have been published in the Journal of geophysical research: solid earth, and the data are true and reliable",

                    "Answer": "The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and 40Ar-39Ar age data provide insights into the orientation and deformation history of rock bodies, as well as the timing of geological events. By analyzing AMS, researchers can infer the flow patterns and stress fields that were present during the formation of the intrusive bodies. The 40Ar-39Ar dating of minerals like biotite, hornblende, and muscovite allows scientists to establish a chronological framework for these geological processes, helping to decipher the sequence of emplacement and subsequent alterations. This combination of data supports the interpretation of the intrusive body's emplacement dynamics and the regional tectonic history.",
