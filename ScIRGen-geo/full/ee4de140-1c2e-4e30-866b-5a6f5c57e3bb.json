                "Land cover is a dynamic variable that changes rapidly across the globe. Therefore, high-quality and timely land cover information is important for addressing global environmental change issues. Global land cover datasets provide fundamental information on land surfaces and are important variables in environmental research. With the continuous development of remote sensing technology, various global and regional land cover products have emerged, such as International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) land cover, Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), Globeland30, and so on. However, due to the differences in sensor types, spatial and temporal resolution, interpretation marks, classification methods, and thresholds, the datasets have uncertainty and poor comparability. China is experiencing both fast climate change and rapid urbanization, which have brought about food security issues as well as environmental security issues. Moreover, China has implemented a series of policies influencing land cover change. China’s ecological engineering programs, such as the Grain for Green Program, have increased vegetation coverage and changed the forest cover across tens of millions of hectares. China's land consolidation has focused on two core objectives: replenishing arable land and improving agricultural infrastructure. China's land consolidation has supplied 2.8 million hectares of cropland and promoted the sustainable development of rural areas. To slow down the loss of farmland caused by urbanization, China has implemented the strategy of balancing cultivated land occupation and compensation, which requires the same proportion of cultivated land expansion to compensate for the loss in cultivated land. In addition, China has implemented a number of land conservation projects, including soil and water conservation projects and grassland ecological conservation programs. Therefore, as China has become a prominent area of global land cover change through a series of land use policies, it is urgent to identify the land cover change in China through interactive verification of more data sources in order to form a more rational judgement of land cover change trends and uncertain regions. Currently, there are several remote sensed land cover datasets that can be applied in China. Although MCD12Q1 has a relatively low spatial resolution (500 m), it has a continuous time series from 2001 to 2015. In addition, MCD12Q1 contains a variety of classification schemes, including IGBP classification, the University of Maryland (UMD) classification, leaf area index (LAI) classification, Biome-biogeochemical cycle (BGC) classification, plant functional type (PFT) classification, and FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) -land cover classification system land cover (LCCS). The Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) dataset has a spatial resolution of 300 m and was classified into 22 types of land cover. The greatest advantage of CCI-LC is that it had a continuous time series from 1992 to 2015. Finer than these global datasets, China’s land cover datasets are often at a 30 m resolution. China land cover is a high-resolution dataset based on the land cover data of the ten-year change of the environment in China and the classified data were accurately matched with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and then classified via deep learning. The Global Land Cover Fine Surface Covering 30 (GLC-FCS30) dataset also has a high resolution of 30 m and combines a multitemporal classification model and a spatial-temporal spectral library. The spatial-temporal spectral library was developed by CCI-LC and the MODIS Version 6 Nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function adjusted reflectance (NBAR) product (MCD43A4). Globeland30, with an overall accuracy of over 80%, is the first work to map global land cover at a 30 m resolution. Globeland30 holds more than 20,000 images, mainly from TM, enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and the Chinese HJ-1 satellite images, so that it can provide details on land cover patterns. However, there is currently no unified view on the changing tendency of China’s land cover because continuous time series datasets are often at the global scale, and there is a lack of evidence on whether one dataset is more reliable than others for different areas of China."

Thus, the hypothesis of this study should be forming a land cover fraction dataset in China based on the weighted consistency data fusion method. In order to produce a set of land cover fraction datasets in continuous year series, three research steps were designed: (1) to evaluate the consistency of multi-source land cover data by various methods; (2) to fuse MCD12 and CCI-LC data through a consistency analysis to form a time series land cover fraction map; and (3) to analyse the tendency of land cover change in China from 2001 to 2015."

As the datasets have different resolutions from 30 m to 500 m, the spatial resolution is unified to 1 km using the nearest neighbour method in the categorical variable consistency analysis. Since the datasets have different classification systems, e.g., CCI-LC uses the LCCS systems with 22 land cover types and MCD12Q1 uses IGBP systems with 17 types, we re-classed the land cover types into 8 or 9 types. We used the “Block Statistics” tool of ArcGIS 10.2 to analyse the percentage of each land cover type in 1 km grids. In the weighted consistency analysis, we chose CCI-LC and MCD12Q1 as the two datasets for weighting. We fused CCI-LC and MCD12Q1 according to their weights. We also overlayed all of the land cover types to better show the probability distribution of various land cover types. We selected four different land cover type datasets to validate China-LCFMCD-CCI, including GAIA, the Global-cropland-percentage-map, Hansen-GFC and Globeland30-WTR2010."
