Thanks to the rich time series image data of Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS and the high-performance Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, large-scale surface coverage mapping has become possible. This data uses the three key nodes of Yangon, Hambantota, and Dhaka as the research area. With the help of the Google Earth Engine platform, the existing multiple sets of global land cover products and Landsat satellite series images are combined with multiple data fusion and time series change detection. Using methods such as machine learning, we have developed a high-temporal-spatial-consistent dataset of annual land cover changes with a resolution of 30 m from 2000 to 2020.",

Among the existing open products, higher-resolution global multi-class land cover data are available for a single or short period of time, while annual ones have limited class, preventing longer-term analysis of land cover change in fine spatial detail. Global land cover change information is an important way to understand the complex interaction between human activities and global changes, and it is also the basic input for many ecosystem models, land surface process models, and atmospheric coupling models. With the emergence of numerous Earth observation satellites and the development of computer technology, remote sensing provides an important technical means for obtaining information on large-scale surface cover distribution and changes."

We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory reasoning and decision-making, to integrate existing multiple land cover products to develop a reliable 2015 global 30m resolution land cover product. We then used Landsat series satellite imagery data, change detection methods, and machine learning classification algorithms to develop the global annual land cover data AGLC-2000-2015 from 2000 to 2015. The specific process of data product development is shown in Figure 1. The mapping is mainly divided into two parts: first, based on the D-S evidence theory, multiple global land cover data products are integrated to obtain reliable 2015 land cover products; using the 2015 land cover product as a benchmark, the 2000-2014 land cover maps are updated using change detection and random forest classification methods."
