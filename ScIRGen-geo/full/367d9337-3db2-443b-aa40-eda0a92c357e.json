            "description": "On the basis of the global tropical cyclone track dataset, the global disaster events and losses dataset, the global tide level observation dataset and DEM data, coastline distribution data, land cover information, population and other related data of the Belt and Road, indicators related to the disaster risk and vulnerability of storm surge in each unit are extracted and calculated using100 meter grid as evaluation unit, such as historical intensity of tide level frequency of storm historic arrival, historical loss, population density, land cover type, etc. The comprehensive index of storm surge disaster risk is constructed, and the risk index of storm surge is obtained by using the weighted method. Finally, the storm surge risk index is normalized to 0-1, which can be used to evaluate the risk level of storm surge in each assessment unit.At the same time, the data set includes the corresponding risk index, exposure index and vulnerability assessment results.The key nodes data set only contains  11 nodes which have risks ((Chittagong port, Bangladesh; Kyaukpyu Port, Myanmar; Kolkata, India; Yangon Port, Myanmar; Karachi, Pakistan; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Mumbai, India; Hambantota Port, Sri Lanka; Bangkok, Thailand; China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipeline; Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway).",

                    "Answer": "The integration of global tropical cyclone path data and global disaster event data is crucial because these datasets provide historical context on cyclone occurrences and their impacts. This information helps in analyzing patterns, frequencies, and intensities of cyclones, which are essential for assessing storm surge risks in key regions. By combining these data sources, researchers can develop a more accurate and holistic risk assessment model that accounts for both historical events and potential future scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "Normalizing a storm surge risk index to a 0-1 scale can present challenges such as handling data variability across different regions and ensuring that the scale accurately reflects relative risk levels. Differences in geographical, socio-economic, and environmental factors across regions might lead to skewed interpretations if not properly accounted for. This normalization process requires careful consideration of the weightage and significance of each contributing factor to ensure that the index remains representative and meaningful for comparative analysis.",

Each of these data sources contributes specific metrics related to hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, such as historical storm surge intensities, frequency of past storm occurrences, historical losses, population density, and land cover types. These metrics are used to construct a composite storm surge disaster risk index.",
