            "description": "The data included standard ionic distilled water and K2CO3 aqueous solution with different molar concentrations (0.5 ~ 5.5 mol / L). The concentration of K2CO3 was determined, Raman and infrared spectra were collected, and the correlation between the molar concentrations of K2CO3 and the spectral characteristics under different P-T conditions were discussed. The results show that the O-H Raman stretching mode can be used as an internal standard for the determination of carbonate concentration. Although there are some significant differences, there are differences in the correlation between the relative Raman intensities established in different laboratories. This study established the first calibration of this kind, which may have some application value.",

The use of O-H Raman stretching modes as an internal standard provides a novel calibration approach. However, there are significant differences in the correlations of relative Raman intensity established by different laboratories, particularly between C-O and O-H symmetric stretching modes. This can impact precision and applicability compared to traditional chemical titration methods, which may not account for such spectral variances.",

These variations may also arise from the discrepancies in relative Raman intensity correlations established by different laboratories between the C-O symmetric stretching mode and the O-H symmetric stretching mode.",

This approach could help in standardizing measurements across experiments despite these differences, potentially improving the accuracy of quantitative spectroscopic analysis under varying P-T conditions.",

The concentration of K2CO3 should be precisely measured, followed by the acquisition of Raman and infrared spectra. It is important to explore the correlation between K2CO3 molar concentrations and spectral characteristics under varying pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions. Calibration using the O-H Raman stretching mode as an internal standard can be established, keeping in mind that there may be significant variations and correlation differences in relative Raman intensity between the C-O and O-H symmetric stretching modes across different laboratories.",
