            "description": "Provide the spatial distribution of water intake in six departments of agricultural irrigation, municipal administration, industrial production, animal husbandry, primary energy exploitation and power generation in China from 1990 to 2015, with a spatial accuracy of 0.5 °, and a geographic coordinate system of WGS84. The data comes from the data set of jgcri papers. The historical uniform water intake data of China is obtained after linear interpolation of the original data, mask extraction in China and coordinate system conversion, and is saved in GeoTIFF file format. The methods and standards of data over the years are consistent, the coverage is complete, and the collection and processing process is traceable and reliable. This data realizes the homogenization of existing data products and provides a basis for analyzing the laws of human factors and the interaction mechanism between human factors and natural factors.",
            "instructions": "File name: the water intake data is stored in GeoTIFF format. The file name is \"sectername_km3peryr_yyyy\", where sectername represents the water intake department and yyyy represents the year. For example, DOM_ km3peryr_ 1990. TIFF describes the situation of water intake by municipal departments in 1990.\nData reading method: it can be opened with ArcGIS, R / Python and other programming languages. The unit is cubic kilometer per year.",
