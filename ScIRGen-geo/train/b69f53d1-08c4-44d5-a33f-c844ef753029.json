            "description": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS elemental geochemical analysis and tims SR Nd isotopic composition show that the migmatites in Foping dome of South Qinling recorded multiple partial melting events. The protoliths of migmatite can be divided into two types. The first type of migmatite records the geochronological characteristics of Late Triassic (average age is 214-211ma), and the second type of migmatite records the age characteristics of Neoproterozoic and Late Triassic at the same time. The zircon U-Pb geochronology of the migmatite is complex (2907-187ma). The core of the migmatite contains some ancient zircon records, including some Archean and Neoproterozoic geochronology. The edge of the migmatite contains Late Triassic to early Jurassic (224-187ma). The zircon U-Pb geochronology of the Wulong granitoids indicates that their crystallization ages are 219-192ma, and the geochemical characteristics of the granitoids are quite different. The low mg#granitoids (mg# < 50) can be roughly divided into two groups according to the geochemical characteristics. The first group has the characteristics of high Sr / y ratio (SR / Y > 40), and the second group has the characteristics of normal Sr / y ratio (SR / y < 40). The data comes from the scientific research project \"deep process and resource effect of major geological events in Yanshanian period\" (2016YFC0600404), a national key research and development plan.",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating refers to a technique used to determine the age of zircon crystals by using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. This method allows researchers to analyze the isotopic composition of zircon and obtain precise U-Pb ages, which are crucial for understanding the timing of geological events such as partial melting and magmatic processes in rocks like those from the Nanqinling Foping dome.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity and variability in zircon U-Pb age records in the Foping Dome region are caused by multiple partial melting events recorded in the mixed rocks, with protoliths recording Late Triassic and Neoproterozoic age features. Additionally, the presence of ancient zircon cores from the Archean and Neoproterozoic and Late Triassic to Early Jurassic age records contribute to this complexity.",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating involves several steps: sample preparation where zircon grains are separated and mounted, laser ablation to vaporize a small part of the zircon, and mass spectrometry to analyze the isotopic composition. This method allows for rapid in-situ analysis with minimal sample destruction. Compared to TIMS (Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry), LA-ICP-MS is generally faster and requires less sample preparation but might offer slightly lower precision. TIMS, on the other hand, provides high precision and accuracy but is more time-consuming and requires more extensive sample preparation.",
