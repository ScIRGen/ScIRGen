The data results from DIVA model assessment, including differences along China's coast of relative sea level rise and coastal composition; Combing with a variety of climate scenarios (RCP) and human-induced factors scenario (SSP, protection, and subsidence), we quantitatively evaluate the impacts of extremal water level under the sea level changes from 2010 to 2100 on China's land area, population exposure, and risk and asset. Three RCP-SSPs combinations are presented, RCP 2.6-SSP1, RCP 4.5-SSP2 and RCP 8.5-SSP5.Through different scenario selection and combination, we can compare analysis subsequently environment and the influence of human factors on the evaluation results. Evaluation results can provide the basis for policymakers in the overall risk information, and delimiting the high-risk areas along the coast and quantitatively evaluating coastal zone of adaptation.",

                "Land subsidence is impacting large populations in coastal Asia via relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Coastal areas are threatened by increased flooding during the 21st century and beyond due to climate-induced sea-level rise (SLR). However, the impact of human-induced subsidence and its effect on relative sea-level rise (RSLR) at broad scales has been less assessed. RSLR comprises the sum of climate-driven SLR, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), tectonic vertical land movements, natural subsidence due to consolidation, and human-induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal, drainage, and other causes. A number of important coastal cities built completely or partly on deltaic deposits, such as New Orleans, Bangkok, Jakarta, Shanghai, and Tokyo, have already experienced several meters of human-induced subsidence through the 20th/early 21st century. Hence, subsidence is a process with major consequences for flood risk and adaptation requirements in coastal areas. South, southeast, and east Asia are especially prone to these issues, reflecting the dense coastal population and high subsidence potential of deltas and alluvial plains around these coasts. The mechanisms of land subsidence are complex, resulting from a multitude of natural processes (e.g., natural compaction) and anthropogenic processes (e.g., underground fluid withdrawal). Anthropogenic causes have the potential to greatly accelerate natural subsidence processes to rates often exceeding 1 cm/yr, with more than 10 cm/yr locally observed in Jakarta, Indonesia. Reducing human-induced subsidence (henceforth termed subsidence control) by removing its causes, such as reducing or stopping groundwater withdrawal, has been successfully implemented in several coastal cities, most notably Tokyo. China has the largest coastal population in the world and a high subsidence potential along much of its coast due to the presence of many deltas and alluvial plains. However, the most intense human-induced subsidence happens in cities, relating to rapid urbanization, economic development, industrialization, and over-exploitation of groundwater. Subsidence now affects more than eight percent of China’s land area (or 790,000 km2), with average cumulative land subsidence of more than 20 cm (in 2009). Coastal subsidence research in China is strongly focused on Shanghai with less consideration elsewhere or nationally."

We use the DIVA coastal flood module for the analysis.

To estimate the effects of subsidence control, we assume controlled subsidence rates consistent with the goals set by the Chinese government in the “National Land Subsidence Prevention and Control Programme (NLSPCP) (2011-2020).”"

With all RSLR components, including uncontrolled city subsidence (Assumptions 4 and 5), the 100-year coastal ﬂoodplain will expand to 64,000–74,000 km2 in 2050 (an increase of 20–39%). The largest population in the 100-year coastal ﬂood event is under RCP 8.5-SSP 5 (50 million), with associated assets of US$ 9,566 billion. Population and assets exposed to the 100-year coastal ﬂood event under the highest subsidence assumption is about 36–39% higher than in the climate-induced SLR-only assumption. Subsidence control (Assumption 6) is an effective response to reduce growth in exposure to coastal ﬂooding: the increase compared to the climate-induced SLR only assumption is only 7% for exposed land, 6% for exposed population and 7% for exposed assets, respectively."
