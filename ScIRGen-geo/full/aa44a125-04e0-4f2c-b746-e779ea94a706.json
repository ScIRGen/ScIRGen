            "description": "Firstly, the sample was made into glass sheet by alkali fusion method, and then the content of major elements was determined by wet chemical method on X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF). The specific steps refer to Li Xianhua et al. (2005). In order to determine the content of trace elements, samples were prepared by acid solution method and determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and full spectrum direct reading inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) in 2020. Generally, the error (relative standard deviation) of analysis results of major elements (except H2O +) is less than 3%, rare earth elements and y are less than 4%, and other trace elements are between 3% and 7%. For the specific analysis process, please refer to Liu Ying et al. (1996).",

In contrast, trace elements are measured using ICP-MS and ICP-AES with samples prepared through an acid dissolution method, where rare earth elements and Y have errors of less than 4%, and other trace elements have errors between 3% and 7%.",

                    "Answer": "The use of X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) indicates a preference for precise measurement of major element contents, benefiting from its lower relative standard deviation error of less than 3%. Meanwhile, the application of ICP-MS for trace element analysis suggests a need for high sensitivity to detect lower concentration elements, with an acceptable error range of 3-7%. This combination of techniques highlights a strategic approach to balance precision and sensitivity in geochemical data collection.",

Additionally, the relative standard deviation errors for major elements (excluding H2O+) are typically less than 3%, while rare earth elements and Y have errors less than 4%, and other trace elements range between 3% to 7%, which might also contribute to variations in the data.",
