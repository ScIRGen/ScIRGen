            "description": "This data set comes from the book: glaciers in Hengduan Mountain area, which belongs to the series of scientific investigation in Hengduan Mountain Area of Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The chief editor is Li Jijun, the deputy chief editor is Su Zhen, and the guiding unit is Institute of geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The research team of the book is the Qinghai Tibet Plateau comprehensive research team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the publishing house is Science Press. Due to abundant rainfall and deep snow cover in some areas of Hengduan Mountain. Avalanche, wind blown snow and abnormal snowfall have become a common natural disaster, which has caused great damage to the work and life of local residents. This book makes a detailed record of the snow disaster in Hengduanshan area. The data includes two workbooks and two pictures, which are the statistical table of snow damage status and damage degree, the regional characteristics of avalanche, the topographic cutting degree map of Western Sichuan, Northern Yunnan and southeastern Tibet, and the damage scope map of Hengduanshan avalanche.",
