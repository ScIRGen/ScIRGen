            "description": "Heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin in China. In the past 30 years, a relatively perfect drainage observation system has been established in heihe river basin, which has become an important inland river research base in China.River basin is an important natural research unit, but the boundary of heihe river basin is not unified. In order to facilitate the use of data by users, we collected and sorted out 5 kinds of heihe river basin boundaries commonly seen in the literature:\n1) from 1985 to 1986, China began to conduct systematic research on the heihe river basin as a whole. On the basis of basic investigation and a large number of data mastered, the early heihe river basin map was drawn with an area of 138,900 km ^ 2.The whole basin is divided into three hydrologic balance zones, which are: the balance zone of heihe main stream system, the balance zone of beida river main stream system and the balance zone of ma ying - feng leshan front water system.\n2) sub project national key scientific research project of the ninth five-year plan \"in heihe river basin water resources reasonable use and the economic society and ecological environment coordinated development research\", considering the integrity of the county-level administrative units, on the basis of the first basin boundary using the administrative boundary of basin boundary was revised, formed the \"digital heihe\" published information system (http://heihe.westgis.ac.cn) of the heihe river basin boundary, watershed area of 128700 km ^ 2.The division of hydrological unit inherits the original idea and is divided into three river systems, namely the eastern river system, the central river system and the western river system.\n3) in the comprehensive control plan of heihe river basin of the ministry of water resources, the area of heihe river basin is determined as 142,900 km ^ 2, and the hydrologic unit is divided into two independent water systems in the central and western regions and the east, with an area of 27,000 km2 and 116,000 km ^ 2 respectively.\n4) in 2002-2006 in the national integrated water resources planning, \"the Yellow River\" (piece of) integrated water resources planning working group in 2005, the establishment \"the northwest rivers and water resources and its exploitation and utilization of investigation evaluation report, briefly, to the secondary and tertiary area as the unit of water resources, to complete a series of natural geography and social economy statistical tables, maps and other data.In this comprehensive plan, the area of heihe river basin is about 151,700 km ^ 2, and the plan does not give a more detailed sub-watershed division plan.\n5) based on the high-precision digital elevation model (SRTM and ASTER GDEM), the boundary of heihe river basin was determined by using the GIS hydrologic analysis method.The boundary has been verified by remote sensing and field investigation, and the present situation of modern water resources utilization is considered in the process of basin boundary determination and sub-basin division.",

                    "Answer": "'流域边界' refers to the delineation of watershed boundaries, which is crucial for hydrological studies and data collection in the 黑河流域. It involves defining the geographical area where all precipitation collects and drains off into a common outlet. In the 黑河流域, multiple methodologies have been used over the years to establish these boundaries, considering factors like administrative division integrity, water resource management, and modern hydrological analysis using digital elevation models and GIS. These boundaries are integral to understanding the flow and distribution of water resources within the region.",

In contrast, methods using administrative boundaries and hydrological balance zones rely on existing administrative lines and hydrological balance considerations without the need for high-resolution digital models. The former method allows for more precise mapping based on physical geography, while the latter incorporates socio-political boundaries for delineation.",

Subsequent revisions were driven by the need for administrative boundary alignment during national key technology projects, comprehensive watershed management plans by the Ministry of Water Resources, and broader national water resource planning efforts. Additionally, advancements in GIS and remote sensing technologies provided new methods for boundary determination, leading to further revisions and refinements.",

The process includes applying GIS hydrological analysis methods to delineate the basin's boundary. This boundary determination is then verified through remote sensing and field surveys to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the procedure takes into account the current state of water resource utilization, which helps in refining the sub-basin divisions within the overall river basin.",
