            "description": "This is a photo collection of birds in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau produced during the fieldtrip in December 2020 to January 2021. The geographical area mainly covers the middle-down stream of the Yarlung Zangbo River valley, including Lhasa, Qushui, bird species pheasants, buzzards, laughingthrushs rosefinches and accendors. The species were identified by Song Gang, Xing Jiahua, Qiao Huijie from IOZ, Yang Le, Zhou Shengling from Institute of Plateau Biology, Tibet Autonomous Region, and Yixi Duojie from Museum of Natural Science of Tibet",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method used for photographing bird species in high-altitude wetland ecosystems, such as those in Lhasa and Qushui, involves capturing ecological photographs of birds during specific periods, such as winter. The process includes identifying and documenting various bird species like Tibetan Eared Pheasant, Tibetan Snowcock, and Red-billed Chough in habitats such as alpine meadows, shrubs, forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and farmlands. This method is exemplified by the work of individuals like Song Gang, who conducted photography in December 2020, focusing on these environments and species.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for capturing ecological photographs of wetland birds in the Tibetan Plateau during winter primarily involve photography in specific regions such as Lhasa and Qushui, focusing on a variety of species including terrestrial, aquatic, waders, pigeons, birds of prey, and songbirds. This is done across diverse habitats like alpine meadows, shrubs, forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and farmlands. These methods may differ from other studies in terms of timing (e.g., winter), location (e.g., high-altitude areas), and species focus. In other regions or seasons, data collection might involve different species, habitats, or techniques, such as using acoustic sensors or bird banding, depending on the research objectives and environmental conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The collection and curation of a dataset of wetland bird species' ecological photographs in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau involve capturing ecological photos during specific time periods, such as December 2020, in regions like Lhasa and Qushui. The process includes photographing various bird species, such as Tibetan Eared-Pheasant and Himalayan Snowcock, across different habitats like alpine meadows, shrubs, forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and farmlands. Species identification is conducted by experts from institutions like the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Tibet Plateau Institute of Biology, and the Tibet Museum of Natural History. These experts, such as Song Gang, Xing Jiahua, Qiao Huijie, Yang Le, Zhou Shengling, and Yixi Duojie, ensure accurate identification and documentation of the species photographed.",
