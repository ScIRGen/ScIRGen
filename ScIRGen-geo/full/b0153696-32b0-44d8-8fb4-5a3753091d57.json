            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne imaging spectrometer (OMIS-II) mission was obtained in the Linze station foci experimental area on Jun. 6, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) soil moisture (0-5cm) measured by the cutting ring (50cm^3) along LY06, LY07 and LY08 strips (repeated nine times). The preprocessed soil volumetric moisture data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) surface radiative temperature measured by three handheld infrared thermometers (5# and 6# from Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, and one from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources, which were all calibrated) in LY06 and LY07 strips. There are 49 sample points in total and each was repeated three times synchronizing with the airplane. Data were archived as Excel files. \n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",

                    "Answer": "Calibrating instruments such as handheld infrared thermometers is crucial for ensuring accurate surface radiation temperature observations. In this context, the calibration involves comparing the instrument's measured temperature to a standard source, such as a black body, and using a linear fit equation derived from this comparison to adjust the raw data. This process ensures that the observations are reliable and consistent across different instruments and observation points.",

                    "Answer": "Discrepancies in soil moisture measurements can arise from the use of different sampling frequencies and methods, such as the varying number of observations per sample plot and differences in soil volume measurement techniques. For example, in the described data collection method, soil moisture observations were conducted using a ring knife with a volume of 50cm^3, and each sample plot had 9 observations. Variations in these parameters can lead to inconsistencies in data, affecting the accuracy and comparability of the results.",

                    "Answer": "Using pre-calibrated instruments such as handheld infrared thermometers can enhance data accuracy and reliability by ensuring that the observed surface radiation temperatures are corrected for any systematic errors. Calibration data allows researchers to linearly adjust the raw observed temperatures against a blackbody reference, reducing measurement uncertainty and improving the consistency of data collected during multiple airplane flyovers.",

This data aids in calibrating and validating remote sensing observations, which are crucial for developing models that predict environmental changes and improve the accuracy of remote sensing data interpretations.",
