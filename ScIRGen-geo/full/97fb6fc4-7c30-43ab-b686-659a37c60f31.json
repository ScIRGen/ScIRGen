            "description": "The dataset is the normalized difference water index (NDWI) products from 1970s to 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the NDWI equation which use the difference ratio between the green band and NIR band to enhance the water information, and then to weaken the information of vegetation, soil, buildings and other targets.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.NDWI is usually used to extract surface water information effectively, therefore it is widely used in water resoureces, hydrology, forestry and agriculture.",
            "instructions": "1) File name rules: the NDWI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the NDWI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDWI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDWI;the NDWI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-NDWI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-NDWI.TIF\". 2) How to use the dataset:the NDWI results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the NDWI results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
