This observation site can offer in situ calibration data of apple trees for TASI, WiDAS and L band sensor used in aerospace experiment.\nObservation Site:\nThis point is located in a large and homogeneous apple orchard in Zhangye Experiment Field, Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences. It’s 4 meters away from southwest of No.17 eddy covariance system, and observation height is 4.55 m. Crown size of observed apple tree is 4 m × 4 m. Underlying surface of observation site is mainly apple trees. The coordinates of this site: 38°50′41.70\" N，100°22′11.40\" E.\nObservation Instrument:\nThe observation system consists of one SI-111 infrared radiometers (Campbell, USA) installed vertically downward to apple tree.\nObservation Time:\nThis site operates from 3 August, 2012 to 27 September, 2012. Observation data laagered by every 1 minute uninterrupted. Output data contained sample data of every 1 minute.\nAccessory data:\nLand surface (apple tree) infrared temperature (by SI-111) can be obtained. Dataset is stored in *.dat file, which can be read by Microsoft excel or other text processing software (UltraEdit, et. al). Table heads meaning: Target_C_Avg, apple tree temperature @  4.55 m (℃); SBT_C_Avg, body temperature of SI-111 sensor (℃).\nDataset is stored day by day, named as: data format + site name + interval time + date + time.

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
