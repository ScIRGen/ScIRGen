            "description": "1.\tIt is challenge to scale-up from simplified proxies to ecosystem functioning since the inherent complexity of natural ecosystems hinders such an approach.  One way to address this complexity is to track ecosystem processes through the lens of plant functional traits.  Elevational gradients with diverse biotic and abiotic conditions offer ideal settings for inferring functional trait responses to environmental gradients globally.  However, most studies have focused on differences in mean trait values among species and little is known on how intraspecific traits vary along wide elevational gradients and how this variability reflects ecosystem productivity. \n2.\tWe measured functional traits of the sub-shrub Koenigia mollis (Basionym: Polygonum molle) (a widespread species) in 11 populations along a wide elevational gradient (1515-4216 m) considering from subtropical forest to alpine biomes treeline in the central Himalayas.  After measuring different traits (plant height, specific leaf area, leaf area, length of flowering branches, leaf carbon isotope – δ 13C, leaf carbon and leaf nitrogen concentrations), we investigated drivers on changes of these traits and also characterized their relationships with elevation, climate and net primary productivity (NPP). \n3.\tAll trait values decreased with increasing elevation, except for  δ 13C that increased upwards.  Likewise, most traits showed strong positive relationships with potential evapotranspiration (PET), while  δ 13C exhibited a negative relationship.  In this context, elevation-dependent water-energy dynamics is the primary driver of trait variations.  Further, five key traits (plant height, specific leaf area, leaf carbon, leaf nitrogen and leaf  δ 13C) explained 90.45% of variance in NPP. \n4.\tSynthesis.  Our study evidences how elevation-dependent climate variations affect ecosystem processes and functions.  Intraspecific variability in functional traits is strongly driven by changes in water-energy  dynamics, and reflects changes in community productivity over elevation.  K. mollis, with one of the widest elevational ranges known to date, could be a model species to infer functional trait responses to environmental gradients globally.   This study sheds new insight on how plants modify their basic ecological strategies to cope with changing environments.",

These are measured across a wide elevational range from subtropical forests to alpine biomes. This approach allows researchers to understand intraspecific variability and its impact on ecosystem productivity. In similar ecological studies, data collection methods may also focus on these trait measurements, but the specific traits and elevational ranges can vary depending on the plant species and the objectives of the study. Differences may arise in the selection of traits, the breadth of the elevational gradient studied, and the ecological contexts (such as different biomes or climatic conditions) considered.",

The observed patterns, such as the decrease in most trait values with elevation and the increase in δ13C, suggest a strong relationship between these traits and environmental factors, indicating that elevation-dependent water-energy dynamics primarily drive these trait variations, thus affecting community productivity.",
