            "description": "This dataset contains plant-derived hydrogen isotope, long-chain alkenones, and reconstructed surface temperature data based on UK'37 from lacustrine sediments of the Dahonggou and Honggou sections of the Qaidam Basin, spanning the Eocene-Miocene (~43Ma-~9Ma), providing information on the ancient climate, environment, and uplift history of the northern Tibetan plateau. The data were generated in the labs at the University of Hong Kong and the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The samples were first subjected to potential surface contamination removal, then ground into powder, freeze dried, and extracted with ASE300 using dichloromethane:methanol (9:1, v/v) for organic matter. The components were then separated using n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol, respectively. The long-chain n-alkanes component was analyzed on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph, and the long-chain n-alkane hydrogen isotope was analyzed on a gas chromatograph-isotope ratio mass spectrometer, with data precision better than ±0.3‰. This dataset can be applied in studies of sedimentary environments, climate change, and tectonic uplift. This dataset has been published on CEE in 2023.",
