      "description": "The dataset contains phenological camera observation data collected at the Arou Superstation in the midstream of the Heihe integrated observatory network from June 13 to November 16, 2018. The instrument was developed with data processed by Beijing Normal University. The phenomenon camera integrates data acquisition and data transmission functions. The camera captures high-quality data with a resolution of 1280×720 by looking-downward. The calculation of the greenness index and phenology are following 3 steps: (1) calculate the relative greenness index (GCC, Green Chromatic Coordinate, calculated by GCC=G/(R+G+B)) according to the region of interest, (2) perform gap-filling for the invalid values, filtering and smoothing, and (3) determine the key phenological parameters according to the growth curve fitting (such as the growth season start date, Peak, growth season end, etc.) There are also 3 steps for coverage data processing: (1) select images with less intense illumination, (2) divide the image into vegetation and soil, and (3) calculate the proportion of vegetation pixels in each image in the calculation area. After the time series data is extracted, the original coverage data is smoothed and filtered according to the time window specified by the user, and the filtered result is the final time series coverage. This data set includes relative greenness index (GCC), phenological phase and fractional cover (FC).\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for sites information in the Citation section.",

        "Arid and semiarid regions represent approximately 30 % of the global terrestrial surface area (Dregne, 1991; Scanlon et al., 2006), and dryland expansion occurs under climate change, especially in developing countries (Huang et al., 2016). An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

        "Therefore, it is critical to maintain the balance between oasis and desert systems in order to achieve the goal of sustainable oasis development. Understanding the basic characteristics of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert ecosystems is important to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the oasis–desert area and support the ecological security and sustainable development of the oasis. A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."

Half-hourly turbulent flux data were acquired by an eddy covariance system and scintillometer. The hydrometeorological data (including radiation, soil heat flux, and soil temperature profiles; gradients of air temperature and humidity and of wind speed and direction; and air pressure, precipitation, and soil moisture profiles) were observed from automatic weather stations with a 10 min average period as well as the groundwater table data. Moreover, vegetation and soil parameters were also supplemented in the datasets.

        "QuestionCn": "分析在干旱和半干旱内陆河流流域收集和处理数据时遇到的挑战，特别是与生态环境退化相关的挑战。",
        "AnswerEn": "Challenges include the ecological environment degradation such as drying up of rivers and lakes, degradation of natural vegetation, intensification of land desertification, and frequent dust storms in inland river basins, particularly westward along the Silk Road. These issues complicate the data collection and processing efforts required to maintain ecological stability and monitor environmental changes effectively.",
        "AnswerCn": "挑战包括生态环境退化，如河流和湖泊干涸、自然植被退化、土地沙漠化加剧以及内陆河流域频繁的沙尘暴，特别是在丝绸之路沿线向西发展。这些问题使得维护生态稳定和有效监测环境变化所需的数据收集和处理工作变得更加复杂。",

        "QuestionCn": "请识别潜在的数据集，这些数据集可以扩展或细化，以更好地理解绿洲-沙漠地区的能量、水蒸气和碳交换。",
        "AnswerEn": "Potential datasets include those that contain long-term observations of energy, water vapor, carbon, and methane fluxes, along with auxiliary data on hydrometeorology, vegetation, and soil parameters. These datasets are available from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center and cover the middle and lower reaches of the HRB in western China, providing a comprehensive basis for understanding oasis–desert interactions.",
        "AnswerCn": "潜在的数据集包括那些包含能源、水汽、碳和甲烷通量的长期观测数据，以及关于水文气象、植被和土壤参数的辅助数据。这些数据集来自国家西藏高原数据中心，覆盖了中国西部的黄河中下游地区，为理解绿洲-沙漠相互作用提供了全面的基础。",
