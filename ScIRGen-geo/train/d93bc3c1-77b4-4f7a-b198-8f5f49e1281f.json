            "description": "Sea ice is one of the most active components of the cryosphere and an important part of the global climate system. The Arctic and Antarctic regions are the most widely distributed regions of sea ice and are the sensitive areas of global change. Sea ice concentration (SIC) is defined as the percentage of the area occupied by sea ice, and is a key parameter to estimate the area and extent of sea ice. To date, a variety of SIC algorithms and products have been developed. Based on our previous evaluation work of various passive microwave based SIC algorithms/products, we found that: 1) SIC algorithms have a large uncertainty in the marginal ice zone and in the summer period; 2) Among the SIC algorithms, ASI and BT algorithms perform better overall, and specifically ASI algorithm performs better in the Arctic and BT algorithm performs better in the Antarctic; 3) ASI algorithm tends to underestimate SIC in the marginal ice zone and summer period, while BT algorithm tends to overestimate SIC in these regions and periods. Based on the above findings, we chose the ASI algorithm and BT algorithm as the benchmark algorithm. In view of the fact that the bias of the two algorithms has the opposite characteristics in the Arctic and Antarctic marginal ice zone and summer period, we effectively fused the two algorithms to further eliminate the impact of the bias (we mainly focused on the fusion in the marginal ice zone, i.e., SIC<=30% and the period dominated by summer: June to September in the Arctic, and January to April in the Antarctic), and formed a new passive microwave SIC fusion algorithm i.e., ABH. We also performed weather filtering and shoreline processing on the final retrieval results. The new fusion algorithm, combined with AMSR-E and AMSR2 multi-channel radiometers, was used to produce the daily passive microwave SIC products in the Arctic and Antarctic regions with a spatial resolution of 25 km from 2002 to 2022 (please note that some missing data are caused by the missing observation of the sensor itself). Finally, the SIC products produced by the new algorithm were verified by using the ship-based observation data of the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Research Expedition in 2012-2014. The results show the newly produced SIC products are superior to those based on the single ASI and BT algorithms in terms of absolute accuracy and capturing the dynamic change trend of SIC. The newly produced SIC product has high absolute accuracy, and its RMSE is 9.55% in the Arctic and 11.37% in the Antarctic. The product can also well capture the dynamic trend of SIC, and the R2 values in both Arctic and Antarctic are above 0.8.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of polar research, a 'passive microwave sea ice concentration product' refers to a dataset derived from passive microwave sensors such as AMSR-E and AMSR2, which measure the proportion of sea ice within a given area (sea ice concentration) at the poles. This data is crucial for estimating sea ice area and extent, particularly in regions like the Arctic and Antarctic, which are sensitive to global climate changes. Different algorithms, such as ASI and BT, are used to produce these products, and they are evaluated and fused to improve accuracy, especially in sea ice edge areas and during summer months.",

                    "Answer": "The ABH algorithm, which is a fusion of ASI and BT algorithms, shows improved accuracy over using ASI or BT algorithms alone, particularly in polar sea ice edge regions and during summer periods. It effectively reduces biases by utilizing the opposing high and low estimation characteristics of ASI and BT, resulting in a new passive microwave sea ice concentration product with a lower RMSE of 9.55% in the Arctic and 11.37% in the Antarctic. The ABH algorithm also captures dynamic trends in sea ice concentration with an R2 value greater than 0.8 in both regions.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of ASI and BT algorithms, which show opposite biases during the Arctic summer months, involves addressing discrepancies at the sea ice edge where SIC is less than or equal to 30%. By merging these algorithms and applying a 'positive-negative offset' principle, researchers aim to mitigate the impact of biases, leading to a more accurate SIC representation that reflects dynamic changes effectively. This approach suggests that carefully balancing algorithmic strengths can improve data accuracy in challenging conditions.",

The next step is to address the discrepancies in sea ice concentration estimation at the sea ice edge regions and during summer periods by effectively merging the two algorithms. This merging utilizes their opposite overestimation and underestimation characteristics to neutralize biases, particularly focusing on areas where sea ice concentration is less than or equal to 30% and during summer months (June to September for the Arctic and January to April for the Antarctic). The process includes applying weather filtering and coastline processing to the inversion results. Finally, the new fusion algorithm combines AMSR-E and AMSR2 multi-channel radiometer data to produce daily passive microwave sea ice concentration products with a spatial resolution of 25 km for the years 2002-2022.",
