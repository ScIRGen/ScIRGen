            "description": "1) Data content: 200 hPa and 850 hPa zonal wind speeds in Eurasia (reflecting the high and low level westerly winds) under the full forcing, orbital parameter forcing, greenhouse gas forcing and ice sheet forcing factors since 11.5 ka of the Holocene; 2) Data source: four transient climate simulations of the Holocene since 11.5 ka performed with the Earth system model CESM (horizontal resolution is about 2° x 2°), fully and singly forced by time-varying\nboundary conditions of orbital configurations, atmospheric GHGs, and ice sheets. Each simulation is continuously integrated from the Holocene (11.5 ka) to the pre-industrial period (1850 CE), and the monthly zonal wind speed data output by the model. Processing method: annual average; 3) Data application: used for the study of paleoclimate change and dynamic mechanism.",

                    "Answer": "The transient simulation data, generated using the CESM Earth system model, provides insights into how various forcing factors—such as orbital parameters, greenhouse gas concentrations, and ice sheet dynamics—affect the zonal wind speeds at different atmospheric levels over Eurasia. By analyzing these simulations, researchers can infer the dynamic mechanisms and historical climate changes that influence the behavior of Eurasian westerlies during the Holocene, contributing to a deeper understanding of past climate variations and their driving forces.",

These factors determine how well the model can replicate historical wind speed patterns at 200 hPa and 850 hPa in the Eurasian region.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing a dataset with transient simulations that account for different forcings like orbital parameters, greenhouse gas concentrations, and ice sheet changes can potentially enhance the accuracy of simulating Holocene atmospheric circulation patterns. These simulations allow for a comprehensive understanding of how multiple factors interact over time, leading to a more nuanced representation of the dynamics of the westerlies at different atmospheric levels (200 hPa and 850 hPa) across the Eurasian region. This approach helps in isolating the contributions of individual forcings and assessing their combined effects, which is crucial for studying paleoclimate changes and understanding the underlying dynamical mechanisms.",

This is achieved through the application of an Earth system model (CESM) with different forcing scenarios, such as orbital parameters, greenhouse gases, and ice sheets, to analyze their impacts from the Holocene to the pre-industrial period.",

This model is used to conduct transient simulation experiments from the Holocene (11.5 ka) to the pre-industrial era (1850 AD). The simulations include a full-forcing transient simulation considering Earth's orbital parameters, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and ice sheet forcings, as well as three single-forcing transient simulation experiments. The model outputs monthly zonal wind speed data, which are then processed into annual averages for analysis.",
