            "description": "This dataset contains the sequence data of the lake core TOC, CaCO₃, particle size and environmental magnetism parameters from 600 years to 1998 of Yamdrog Yumtso in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau. It is used to study the environmental changes in the Yamdrog Yumtso region in the 1400 years. \nThis data set is obtained from laboratory measurements. The data are obtained immediately after the completion of the instrument or experiment. The samples and data are collected in strict accordance with relevant operating procedures at all stages and comply with the laboratory operating standards. \nThe TOC analysis is undertaken by a CS-344 analyzer, The CaCO₃ content is measured by the general chemical method, the particle size is measured with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser particle sizer, and the environmental magnetism parameters are measured with a Kappa Bridge, DIGICO magnetometer and superconducting magnetometer.\nThe rock core was collected from Chen Co Lake in the Yamdrog Yumtso Basin in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau; the approximate sampling location is 90.49E, 28.93N, and the lake’s elevation is 4420 m.",
