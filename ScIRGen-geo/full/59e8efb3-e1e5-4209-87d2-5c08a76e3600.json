            "description": "The alpine region of Asia is the third pole in the world, and it is called the \"Asian water tower\". Affected by climate warming, glaciers continue to lose money, which has profoundly changed the supply-demand relationship of glacial water resources. In order to systematically understand the response of glaciers to climate change, the project reveals the relationship between the change of glacier material balance and climate factors through the sensitivity of glacier material balance. The data includes two maps: the sensitivity distribution map of material balance to temperature and precipitation and the climate sensitivity zoning.\nIn the past 70 years, there have been significant differences in the evolution sequence of glacier material balance among mountain systems in the high mountain region of Asia. The glaciers in the Karakoram and West Kunlun regions have shown a stable state, and the material balance is a weak positive balance, while the Himalayas, Tianshan and Qilian Mountains have shown an accelerated trend after 1990. This is mainly due to the sensitivity of material balance to temperature and precipitation. The monthly scale material balance model is driven by 0.5 ° resolution era5 temperature and precipitation data, and the material balance calibration parameters of 43 monitored glaciers are 1 ° from 2000 to 2016 × The parameters are spatially constrained by the 1 ° aster material balance data, and the material balance sequences of 95085 glaciers in the high mountain region of Asia from 1951 to 2020 are reconstructed by using the method of extrapolation of spatial parameters. The sensitivity of glacier material balance to temperature (± 0.5K, ± 1K, ± 1.5k) and precipitation (± 10%, ± 20%, ± 30%) is analyzed, In combination with the influencing factors of glacier material balance (distribution of summer temperature, ratio of summer precipitation, distribution of glacier types, distribution of clear sky solar radiation in summer, etc.), the glacial climate sensitivity in the high mountain region of Asia is classified and divided into four categories, as shown in Fig. 4: the main control area of air temperature: the temperature is the main control factor of glacier material balance change, and precipitation occupies a secondary position; Precipitation control area: the glacier is mainly controlled by precipitation, and the temperature in the glacier area is lower than 0 ° C throughout the year; Temperature and precipitation control area of accumulated glacier in winter: refers to that the glacier is mainly supplied by precipitation in winter, and the change of material balance of the glacier is the result of the joint action of temperature and precipitation; Summer cumulative glacier temperature and precipitation control area: refers to the supply mode of glacier is summer precipitation, and the material balance of glacier is the result of the joint action of temperature and precipitation.",

                "High Mountain Asia (HMA) is known as the Asian water tower, as it constitutes the largest concentration of glaciers and ice caps outside the polar regions, accounting for approximately 30% of the total area of all mountain glaciers on Earth. Due to ongoing climate change, most of the glaciers in HMA have suffered remarkable mass loss, becoming vulnerable and unsustainable due to their higher ablation than accumulation in these regions. The mass balance spatial heterogeneity loss has been obvious across HMA in recent decades, with extremely negative mass balance leading to marked glacier thinning in Tian Shan and Hengduan Shan. Nevertheless, the current climate factors do not fully explain the mass balance differences, such as the Karakoram Glacier Anomaly, as numerous gaps remain in our knowledge of regional glacier behavior and the interactions of glaciers with complex topography. Spatial heterogeneity of the mass balance within HMA is driven by different atmospheric circulation patterns, which transform the annual distribution and source of precipitation. It has been pointed out that the currently stable regional mass balance of Karakoram Anomaly glaciers might be attributable to topographic factors. The effect of complex topography on glacier mass balance reflects the influence of topographic shading. By obstructing solar illumination, topographic shading exerts a direct impact on solar radiation reaching the glacier surface and has a significant effect on glacier mass balance."

We calculated the grid topographic shading by ray tracing according to the location between the grid and solar beam. Glacier surface topographic shading was calculated following the workflow shown in Figure 2 using the DEM and glacier outlines dataset. To obtain the glacier slope and aspect data, we transformed the DEM data from geographical coordinates to Asia North Lambert Conformal Conic projection coordinates, which is the projection data used to calculate the slope and aspect of glaciers within HMA. Finally, we obtained hourly glacier topographic shading data for all glaciers within HMA during the ablation period following the above steps."

Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the topographic shading and mass balance in these small north-facing glaciers. This indicates that complex terrain can affect the spatial distribution of the mass balance by altering the solar illumination pattern."

This involves a detailed calculation of glacier surface topographic shading data during ablation periods to assess its impact on mass balance.",

                    "Answer": "The significant differences in glacier mass balance evolution across various mountain systems in High Mountain Asia are mainly attributed to the sensitivity of glacier mass balance to temperature and precipitation. The Karakoram and western Kunlun regions show stable mass balance due to weak positive balance, while regions like the Himalayas, Tian Shan, and Qilian Shan have shown accelerated retreat trends post-1990s. This is primarily due to their mass balance sensitivity to factors such as temperature and precipitation.",

                    "Answer": "There is a lack of systematic assessment in understanding the influence of complex topography on glacier mass balance across High Mountain Asia because current climate factors alone do not fully explain the mass balance differences under similar conditions. Complex topography, including topographic shading, significantly impacts solar radiation reaching the glacier surface, thereby affecting glacier mass balance. The complexity and variability of these topographic influences require more detailed investigation and data collection methods.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial heterogeneity in mass balance within High Mountain Asia is caused by varying atmospheric circulation patterns, which transform the annual distribution and source of precipitation. These patterns affect the mass balance by altering the seasonal accumulation and ablation processes across different regions. Additionally, topographic factors such as shading further contribute to this heterogeneity by affecting solar radiation exposure.",

The grid topographic shading is calculated by ray tracing based on the location between the grid and solar beam. Glacier surface topographic shading is computed using a workflow with DEM and glacier outlines data. The DEM data are transformed from geographical coordinates to Asia North Lambert Conformal Conic projection coordinates to calculate the slope and aspect of glaciers. This approach is used to obtain hourly glacier topographic shading data during the ablation period.",

This involves using a mass balance model driven by ERA5 temperature and precipitation data at a 0.5° resolution, calibrated with mass balance rates from 43 monitored glaciers. The parameters are spatially constrained using ASTER mass balance data from 2000-2016, and spatial extrapolation methods are used to reconstruct the longer-term mass balance sequence for 95,085 glaciers from 1951-2020.",

This analysis allows for the categorization into four main types of climate sensitivity regions: temperature-controlled, precipitation-controlled, winter accumulation type (temperature and precipitation controlled), and summer accumulation type (temperature and precipitation controlled).",

This is because current climate factors do not fully explain mass balance differences at smaller scales under the same climate conditions. Additionally, complex topography, such as topographic shading, affects solar radiation reaching the glacier surface, which must be taken into account.",
