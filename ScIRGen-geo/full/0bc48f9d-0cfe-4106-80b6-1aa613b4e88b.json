            "description": "The alpine and anoxic environment of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is a major challenge for human survival and life. When human beings boarded the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and adapted to the extreme environment of the plateau has always been a hot issue in the academic circles. At present, in the study of prehistoric culture of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, except the northeast, most areas of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau have not established archaeological cultural sequences. Yajiang river basin is one of the areas with dense distribution of human activity relics, but there are few archaeological excavations and studies, and the activity history of the ancients in this area is not clear. Based on the systematic dating of cultural archaeological sites in Linzhi Area, Southeast Tibet, 33 carbon fourteenth age data were obtained.",
