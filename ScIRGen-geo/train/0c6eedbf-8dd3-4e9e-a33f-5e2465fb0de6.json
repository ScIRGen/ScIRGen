            "description": "The dataset is the MODIS Terra surface reflectance products of 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau,each period of data contains 13 files: 7 surface reflectence files, 3 observation angle files, 2 quality control files and 1 time description file. The dataset is download from USGS and its format is converted from .hdf to .tif by GDAL.The sur_refl_qc_500m and sur_refl_state_500m layers are the quality identification documents,which are stored in an efficient bit-encoded manner.The MODIS surface reflectance play an important role in forest, water resources, climate change.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules:the data of land surface reflectance is stored in units of years in a folder named surface_reflectance, and the subfolder's name is presented as \"date\",for example, 2020; the name rule of each file of land surface reflectance result is \"MOD09A1_date_sur_refl_bxx.tif\",for example, MOD09A1_2020017_sur_refl_b02.tif; the name rule of quality identification data is \"MOD09A1_date_sur_refl_qc_500m.tif\" and \"MOD09A1_date_sur_refl_state_500m.tif\"; the name rule of angle data is \"MOD09A1_date_sur_refl_szen.tif\", \"MOD09A1_date_sur_refl_szen.tif\" and \"MOD09A1_date_sur_refl_raz.tif\", which represent the file of solar zenith angle, view zenith angle and relative azimuth angle; and the name rule of date description is \"MOD09A1_date_sur_refl_day_of_year.tif\". 2)How to use the dataset: the dataset can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the surface reflectance data are multiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -28672; the background filling value of band specific quality data (sur_refl_qc_500m) is 4294967295; the background filling value of surface reflectance state(sur_refl_state_500m) is 65535; and the angle data are multiplied 0.01, and the background filling value is 0.",
