One such indicator is the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), a metric for the level of development and quality of life of a municipality. MHDI is derived from the Human Development Index (HDI), a global indicator which is one of the most widely accepted metrics for representing the development status of a country. Like the HDI, the MHDI is composed by three sub-indices: (1) MHDI Education, (2) MHDI Income and (3) MHDI Longevity that, together, offer a detailed view about the development status of a municipality. Conventional knowledge in Brazil states that left-wing parties are the preferred choice for voters residing in less developed regions, where basic needs in education, sanitation, health and food remain unmet, while centrist and right-wing parties tend to be preferred by voters residing in more developed regions, where basic needs usually have been met and the main concerns revolve around employment, security and economic development."
