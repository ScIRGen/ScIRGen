            "description": "This data set includes daily average data on soil temperature, humidity and carbon flux obtained from a station in Southeast Tibet from 2007 to December 2019. \nThe data collection site is the atmospheric environment observation site of the Integrated Observation and Research Station of the Alpine Environment in Southeast Tibet, which is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The site is located at longitude 94°44'18\", latitude 29°45'56\" and is at an elevation of 3326 m. \nThe observation instrument models are as follows:\nSoil temperature: Campbell Co 107;\nSoil humidity: Campbell Co CS616;\nCarbon flux: Collector model: C3000, Measurement interval: 10 seconds;\nThe observations and data collection were performed in strict accordance with the instrument operating specifications, and the data have been published in relevant academic journals. Data with obvious errors were removed, and missing data were replaced with null values.\nObservation of the soil thermal flux was stopped in 2013. In 2015, due to damage to the station probe, soil temperature and humidity data were recorded only for the first two months, the probe was repaired in April 2016.",

Data is collected at 10-second intervals and processed for daily averages. Observations are conducted following strict instrument operation guidelines, with any obvious errors being removed. In the event of instrument malfunction, as occurred in 2015, data collection is paused until repairs, such as probe replacement, are completed. Missing data is left blank, and the data is validated through publication in academic journals.",

Other reasons could include harsh environmental conditions affecting equipment reliability, human errors during data collection, or the exclusion of erroneous data points identified through quality checks.",
