            "description": "Provenance of Cretaceous-Miocene sedimentary rocks in the Nepalese Lesser Himalayas is significant for understanding the timing and pattern of the India-Asia collision and tectonic evolution of the Himalaya orogen. This research analyses the provenance of Cretaceous-Miocene sedimentary rocks in two representative sections (Butwal section and Kalya section) in Nepalese Lesser Himalaya, which constrain the timing and pattern of the India-Asia collision and reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the Himalayan orogen. An ATL 193 nm ArF excimer laser ablation (LA) system coupled with an Agilent 7700X inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrument was adopted to complete detrital zircon U-Pb dating of ten samples; A Geolas HD LA system coupled with a Neupane Plus multi-collector ICP-MS instrument were used to complete zircon in-situ Hf isotope analysis. Analytical results of detrital zircon U-Pb-Hf indicate that the timing of the India-Asia collision was no later than the early-middle Eocene in the central Himalayas, and the Greater Himalayas exposed to the surface by the early Miocene.",

Techniques such as U-Pb dating of detrital zircons using laser ablation systems connected to mass spectrometers are utilized to achieve precise chronological constraints. Additionally, in-situ Hf isotope testing of zircons is performed to further understand the provenance and tectonic settings.

This also aids in reconstructing the tectonic evolution history of the Himalayan orogeny, suggesting that the collision in the central Himalayas occurred no later than the early to middle Eocene, and that the High Himalayas were exposed to the surface by at least the early Miocene.",
