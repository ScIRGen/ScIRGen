            "titleEn": "Upscaling scheme for global urbanization products",
            "description": "The upscaling scheme is to convert the targeted global urbanization products into surface input data with a desired resolution of 0.9°×1.25° for the Community Land Model (CLM), and further adjust the converted data to obtain the corresponding global urban proportion data for CLM climate modelling. The conversion is accomplished via the Urban Properties Tool (UPT) in the Toolbox for Human-Earth System Integration and Scaling (THESIS) provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The adjustment is because the UPT-converted data may differ from CLM historical data in terms of urban distribution and urban areas. To avoid the abrupt change in CLM simulation results between historical and future time, the converted data needs to be adjusted. The adjustment includes the following steps: 1) Adjust the proportion of urban subgrid; 2) Adjust the proportion of vegetation and cropland subgrids; 3) Re-assign urban density types; 4) Linearly interpolate the subgrid proportion for the remaining years. The upscaling scheme has been successfully applied to the 1 km resolution global urbanization product (2020~2070) developed by Beijing Normal University. The new product obtained by the upscaling scheme shows significantly increased global urban area compared to original data. Its global urban area and temporal trend are also reasonably consistent with other publicly-shared global urbanization products. The upscaling scheme has provided an example for customizing CLM's urban parameterization, so that in the future, researchers can use other urban-related data of different sources, convert them into CLM-supported format, and perform exclusive climate simulations.",
            "instructions": "File naming: The upscaling scheme consists of three MATLAB scripts (file extension “.m”). “BNUadj1_2020.m” is to adjust the UPT-converted 2020 data of Beijing Normal University's 1 km global urbanization product. “BNUadj2_20x0.m” is to adjust the data for the years 2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, and 2070. “BNUadj3_20xx.m” is to adjust the data for the remaining years during 2020~2070.\nApplication method: All scripts can be directly opened, edited, and executed by MATLAB.",

                    "Answer": "The process using the Urban Properties Tool involves converting specified global urbanization products into a format that meets the requirements of the CLM model, followed by adjustments to reconcile differences with historical CLM data. This method includes specific adjustments like subgrid proportion adjustments, vegetation and cropland proportion adjustments, reallocation of urban density types, and linear interpolation for other years. Compared to other methods, this approach provides a detailed framework for user-customizable urban parameterization, and has been shown to result in a significantly increased global urban area with reasonable temporal trends when applied to a 1 km resolution global urbanization product.",

                    "Answer": "The data conversion process using THESIS, specifically the Urban Properties Tool (UPT), is critical as it transforms global urbanization products into a resolution compatible with the Community Land Model (CLM) for climate simulations. This process could introduce discrepancies in urban distribution and area compared to historical CLM data, impacting the accuracy of climate predictions. Therefore, adjustments are necessary to align the converted data with CLM's historical data, which involves modifying subgrid proportions and urban density types, and applying linear interpolation over time. Such steps help mitigate sudden shifts between historical and future simulation results, enhancing the reliability of the data for climate modeling.",

This discrepancy can lead to abrupt changes between historical and future simulation results, necessitating adjustments to ensure continuity and accuracy. Steps involved include adjusting the proportion of urban sub-grid areas, vegetation and farmland sub-grid proportions, redistributing urban density types, and performing linear interpolation of sub-grid proportions for remaining years.",

The upscaling process involves converting global urbanization products to a compatible resolution and adjusting them to prevent abrupt changes in simulations between historical and future projections. This can result in a significant increase in the total urban area representation in the dataset, providing a more realistic input for climate simulations.",

This process, facilitated by tools like the Urban Properties Tool from THESIS, ensures that the urban data aligns with the historical data used in CLM, preventing abrupt changes in simulation results between historical and future scenarios. The ultimate goal is to provide a more accurate and reasonable global urbanization dataset for climate modeling, which can then be adjusted and customized for specific research needs. This approach exemplifies how urban parameters can be tailored within CLM models, offering a framework for other researchers to convert various urban data sources into CLM-compatible formats for targeted climate simulations.",
