            "description": "The dataset based on synthesized data from 1114 sites across the Tibetan permafrost region which report that paleoclimate is more important than modern climate in shaping current permafrost carbon distribution.A new estimate of modern soil carbon stock to 3m depth on Tibetan permafrost region was derived by machine learning algorithm, including factors such as climate (paleoclimate and modern climate), vegetation, soil (soil thickness and soil physical and chemical properties, etc.) and topography. This dataset shows that ecosystem models clearly underestimated the Tibetan soil carbon stock, due to the absence of paleoclimate effects in the model. Future modelling of soil carbon cycling should include paleoclimate .",

                    "Answer": "Soil carbon stock estimation in the context of permafrost regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau refers to the process of quantifying the amount of carbon stored in soils up to a depth of 3 meters. This includes considering factors such as past and present climate conditions, vegetation, soil characteristics, and topography. The estimation is conducted using machine learning algorithms to reassess the soil carbon reserves, emphasizing the role of paleoclimate. This approach addresses the underestimation of carbon stocks by current terrestrial ecosystem models, which often overlook the impact of ancient climate influences.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of paleoclimate data is crucial for assessing soil carbon stocks in permafrost regions as it considers historical climate conditions that have influenced soil carbon accumulation. This integration can refine existing models by addressing the underestimation of soil carbon stocks, as current models may not account for the historical influence of climate on soil properties. Including paleoclimate data allows for a more comprehensive understanding of soil carbon dynamics, potentially leading to more accurate predictions of carbon storage and release under changing climate conditions.",

                    "Answer": "Current land ecosystem models often underestimate the soil carbon storage in the Tibetan Plateau due to the lack of consideration for the influence of paleoclimate. This underestimation is significant as the models do not incorporate the impact of ancient climate conditions, which are crucial in assessing the soil carbon reservoir in permafrost regions. The integration of climate (both paleoclimate and modern conditions), vegetation, soil properties, and topographical factors using machine learning algorithms helps in reassessing the soil carbon storage more accurately.",

                    "Answer": "The estimation of soil carbon storage in the Tibetan Plateau is enabled by integrating a comprehensive dataset of soil survey data from 1,114 sampling points, which takes into account factors like paleoclimate, modern climate conditions, vegetation, soil properties (such as soil layer thickness and soil physical and chemical attributes), and topography. These factors are analyzed using machine learning algorithms to reassess the soil carbon storage estimates and address the underestimation by current terrestrial ecosystem models which often neglect the impact of paleoclimate.",
