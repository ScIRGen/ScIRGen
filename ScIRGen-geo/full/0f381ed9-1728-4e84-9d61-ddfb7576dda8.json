            "description": "Fluoride (F) is widely distributed in natural environment and is closely related to human health.Tibetan Plateau is one of the most severe area in China suffering for endemic fluorosis. Meanwhile,  water ingestion is an important ways to fluoride enters human body. It is of great important to the prevention and control of  endemic fluorosis in the Tibetan Plateau that obtaining water fluoride concentration and human health risk data. The dataset contains fluoride concentration and helth risk data in 3 cities in  the Tibet autonomous region (Lhasa, shannan, nyingchi). The data present in TXT format. A total of 355 water samples were sampled between 2019-2022, Augest - October each year. The sample collection method is based on GB12997-91. During sampling, the unused polyethylene bottle was cleaned 2-3 times with water samples, then the bottle was filled with water samples and acidified with high-purity concentrated nitric acid, refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for immediate filtration and testing.  Fluoride in water was analyzed by fluoride ion selective electrode method (GB7484-87). The relative standard deviation of parallel sample determination was 0.3%.  The sample sites basically covered representative natural water bodies, such as the main and tributaries of typical rivers, important lakes, hot springs and well water in the research area. ",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method involves sampling natural water sources such as rivers, lakes, hot springs, and wells on the Tibetan Plateau. Challenges may arise due to the remote and high-altitude location, which can affect logistics of sample collection, preservation, and transportation. The use of specific techniques like the fluoride ion selective electrode method also requires careful calibration and handling, which can introduce variability if not meticulously performed. The method of sample acidification with high-purity concentrated nitric acid and the need for immediate filtration and testing in the laboratory further highlight potential areas of difficulty in ensuring consistent and accurate measurements.",

This method ensures precise readings of fluoride levels in water samples, which are crucial for assessing human exposure risks and informing public health strategies. However, potential consequences might include limitations in detecting extremely low concentrations or interference from other ions present in the water.",

This is crucial because the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is one of the most severely affected areas in China by endemic fluorosis, and drinking water is a significant route of human fluoride exposure.",

The methodology for sample collection followed the GB12997-91 standard. Initially, unused polyethylene bottles were rinsed 2-3 times with the water sample.
