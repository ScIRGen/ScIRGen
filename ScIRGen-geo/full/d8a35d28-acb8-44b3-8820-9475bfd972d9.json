            "description": "Monthly average daytime as well as nighttime data of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) for 354 cities in China. The time range of the data is from January 2012 to December 2021, with a temporal resolution of month-by-month. The spatial resolution is 1 km.\nThe data is mainly based on the MYD07 atmosphere profile dataset and MYD11 land surface temperature dataset provided by MODIS, and incorporates the wind speed provided by ERA5 reanalysis data. The urban boundary is demarcated according to the 2018 data provided by Global Urban Boundary-GUB dataset. All the data are resampled to 1 km, in order to maintain the uniform spatial resolution.\nWith the rapid urbanization and global warming, the data are useful for studying the spatiotemporal patterns of urban thermal comfortable and related analysis.",
            "instructions": "File name: the data is stored in TIF format. The name of the file is \"china_yyyy_ddd.txt\", where yyyy represents the year and DDD represents the date of Julian. For example, 2005001.txt represents the TIF file describing the spatial distribution of the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) in China during the daytime in January 2012.\nData reading method: all TIF files in the data set can be directly opened with available ArcGIS for image display, and the main content is UTCI value.",

                    "Answer": "The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) is a data value calculated to assess urban thermal comfort. It is derived from integrating various datasets, such as MYD07 atmospheric profile data, MYD11 surface temperature data from the MODIS dataset, and wind speed data from ERA5 reanalysis data. This index provides a measure of thermal comfort for 354 cities in China, with data spanning from January 2012 to December 2021. The UTCI acknowledges the impact of global warming and rapid urbanization, helping to analyze the temporal and spatial variations in urban heat comfort.",

                    "Answer": "The methodologies using MODIS-based atmospheric profile and surface temperature data along with ERA5 reanalysis wind speed data provide a comprehensive approach by integrating satellite and reanalysis data, allowing for high spatial resolution and broad coverage, particularly useful in urban settings. This contrasts with other methods that may rely solely on ground-based measurements, which can offer higher temporal resolution and direct observation but lack the extensive spatial coverage and consistent data continuity offered by satellite and reanalysis data integration.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of data sources such as MODIS and ERA5 for calculating the Universal Thermal Climate Index in urban areas is influenced by the requirement for comprehensive atmospheric profile data, surface temperature data, and wind speed data. MODIS provides the necessary atmospheric and surface temperature data through its MYD07 and MYD11 datasets, while ERA5 offers high-resolution reanalysis data for wind speed. These sources are chosen to ensure accurate and reliable calculations of thermal comfort across diverse urban environments.",

This can enhance the accuracy and reliability of urban heat climate indices by providing a detailed spatiotemporal understanding of thermal comfort levels across 354 cities in China from 2012 to 2021, especially considering the uniform 1km spatial resolution achieved through resampling techniques.",

The spatial resolution is standardized to 1km, using data from Global Urban Boundary-GUB to define urban boundaries.
