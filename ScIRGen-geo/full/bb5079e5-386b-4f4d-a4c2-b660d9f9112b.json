            "description": "Through the investigation in selinco basin and Datong River and the excavation of sugE site, the basic information of longitude and latitude, distribution range, topographic characteristics, altitude, cultural attributes and cultural relics of 11 Paleolithic Mesolithic sites are obtained; In addition, the artificial relics, animal and plant remains and soil samples during the site excavation were scientifically collected, extracted and analyzed in the laboratory, and a batch of radiocarbon dating data, stone product measurement data and environmental test data were obtained. The data set enriches the information of Paleolithic sites on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, provides an important basis for the construction of temporal and spatial framework and cultural sequence, and provides data support for the further study of prehistoric human activities and career patterns in the hinterland of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The distribution patterns of archaeological sites, alongside the analysis of cultural relics, provide insights into how prehistoric humans adapted to the challenging environment of the Tibetan Plateau. The data on site locations, elevation, and cultural attributes suggest strategies for survival and resource utilization, reflecting adaptations to the high-altitude and climate conditions. The preservation of plant and animal remains, as well as soil samples, further assists in understanding the subsistence methods and environmental interactions of these populations.",

The process also entails scientifically collecting and extracting artifacts, plant and animal remains, and soil samples during excavation. Laboratory analysis follows, yielding radiocarbon dating data, measurements of stone tools, and environmental testing results. These steps provide a foundational basis for constructing spatiotemporal frameworks and cultural sequences, aiding in the study of prehistoric human activity and subsistence strategies in the Tibetan Plateau.",
