            "description": "With a depositional history spanning the early Aptian to early Albian (~19 mys), the Lower Cretaceous Xinminpu Group in Jiuquan, NW China provides abundant animal and plant fossils. This area is the represented study area of the Lower Cretaceous in China. The absence of a comprehensive stratigraphical framework for this area however limits the degree to which the unit can be interpreted relative to coeval sections and the geological records in genera. This investigation from July 9 to July 11 focuses on the Lower Cretaceous in this area, and collected abundant fossil and rock samples for biostratigraphic and stratigraphic analysis. This dataset includes: stratigraphic column of the Chijinpu Formation in the East Xiagou outcrop, and photographs of outcrops and represented fossils; stratigraphic column of the Xiagou Formation in the Changma outcrop and a photo of bird-bearing outcrop.",

                    "Answer": "The slow progress in paleontological and stratigraphic research of the Lower Cretaceous in the Jiuquan region is likely due to a lack of a high-precision stratigraphic framework and comprehensive paleontological studies. These limitations can affect data collection methods as they may require more detailed geological surveys, collection of fossil and rock specimens, and advanced biostratigraphic research to build a robust dataset.",

This includes the identification and documentation of stratigraphic columns, photographing outcrops, and gathering representative fossils. The surveys conducted from July 9-11, 2020, in the Jiuquan region, focused on gathering such data from the Xiagou and Changma sections, which are crucial for creating a comprehensive biostratigraphic framework.",
