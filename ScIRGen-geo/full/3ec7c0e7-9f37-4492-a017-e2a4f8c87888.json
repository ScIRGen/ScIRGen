                    "Answer": "In the context of climate data collection, '100m×100m spatial resolution' refers to the size of each grid cell within which climate average monthly precipitation data is collected and analyzed. It means that each data point or value represents the average precipitation over an area of 100 meters by 100 meters. This resolution allows for detailed spatial analysis of precipitation patterns in relation to geographic and topographic factors in the middle and upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin.",

                    "Answer": "The method described involves using high-precision DEM data to statistically analyze the relationship between climate average monthly precipitation and geographical terrain factors, resulting in a 100m spatial resolution dataset for the middle and upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin. This approach provides a detailed spatial resolution that might offer more localized insights compared to other methods that might use coarser resolution data or different terrain modeling techniques.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of climate average monthly precipitation data collection in the mid-upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin is influenced by the precision of the DEM data used, the spatial resolution of the data, which is 100m x 100m, and the relationship between climatic precipitation patterns and geographic topographical factors. The use of single precision floating-point data and the management of invalid values, represented as -9, also contribute to the overall accuracy of the dataset.",

                    "Answer": "Using high-resolution DEM data can enhance the accuracy and reliability of precipitation data by providing detailed insights into the topographical influences on precipitation patterns. This allows for a more precise spatial resolution (100m x 100m), which can capture localized variations in precipitation due to terrain features. However, challenges such as data processing complexity and increased computational requirements may arise. The use of DEM data can also help mitigate errors associated with low-resolution data, leading to a more accurate representation of the average monthly precipitation in the river basin.",

This results in a dataset with 100m spatial resolution. The integration process includes assigning spatial grid points with corresponding longitude, latitude, and monthly precipitation data, all formatted in txt files. The data uses an equidistant latitude and longitude projection system, with units in degrees for coordinates and millimeters for precipitation, stored as single-precision floating-point numbers, with a placeholder value of -9 for invalid data.",
