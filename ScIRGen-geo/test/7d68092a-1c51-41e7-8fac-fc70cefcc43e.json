China's 1:100000 land use data is constructed in three years based on LANDSAT MSS, TM and ETM Remote sensing data by means of satellite remote sensing, organized by 19 research institutes affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the national macro survey and dynamic research on remote sensing of resources and environment, a major application project of the eighth five year plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Using a hierarchical land cover classification system, this data divides the whole country into six first-class categories (cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, urban and rural areas, industrial and mining land, residential land and unused land), and 31 second-class categories. This is the most accurate land use data product in China, which has played an important role in the national land resource survey, hydrological and ecological research.",

In the context of land use data collection, it involves a hierarchical system that classifies land into primary categories such as cultivated land, forest, grassland, water bodies, urban areas, industrial and mining areas, residential areas, and unused land. This system helps in systematically analyzing satellite remote sensing data to produce detailed and accurate land use information, as demonstrated by the use of Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM remote sensing data in China.",
