                "The shortness of the satellite record limits our ability to quantify the possible contribution of anthropogenic forcing and internal variability to the observed Antarctic sea ice variability. Satellite observations have shown that sea ice in the Arctic has been declining rapidly over the last 40 years, which is consistent with the expectation of amplified Arctic warming due to ice-albedo feedback. In contrast, the total sea ice extent (SIE) in the Antarctic showed a slight but significantly increasing trend from 1979 to 2015, although this trend did not continue in recent years (2016–2018), during which anomalously low ice cover was observed. Coupled climate models have had limited success in correctly simulating fundamental aspects of the observed annual cycle and the long-term trends. Multiple factors contribute to the observed trends of Antarctic SIE. The cooling of surface waters in the Southern Ocean due to the observed strengthening of the westerly winds and upward trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) might be another factor resulting in the positive trend in Antarctic SIE. The satellite data record in the Antarctic is quite short; it begins in the late 1970s, and the discrepancies between observations and model simulations limit our understanding of Antarctic sea ice variability and its links to regional climate over longer periods, especially at the multi-decadal scale. Using paleoclimate archives is the best approach for reconstructing the past sea ice state. Several studies have reconstructed past changes in Antarctic sea ice using various proxy data extracted from ice cores. Reconstructions of sea ice around Antarctica from regional to continental scales are essential to estimate the contribution of internal and external forcings in Antarctic sea ice variability and evaluate climate model simulations."

To improve projections for the coming decades, an understanding of the interactions of teleconnections and local feedback mechanisms at longer time scales is needed. In this study, we use ice-core-based reconstructions to examine the regional and overall changes in Antarctic SIE during the past 100–200 years. We also discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for the identified variations in the context of climate variability at the multi-decadal scale."

Coupled climate models have had limited success in correctly simulating fundamental aspects of the observed annual cycle and the long-term trends. The discrepancy between climate models and observations likely stems from climate forcing, rather than sea ice physics. Although these estimates of sea ice changes are generally in agreement, the considerable uncertainties arise from the individual proxies and different indicators employed, and the aforementioned reconstructions and their unified quantization require further validation."

The NLSIE in BS was reconstructed using the annual net accumulation record from the Bruce Plateau ice core extracted from the Antarctic Peninsula, covering the period of 1900–2009. The NLSIE in AS was reconstructed using SOFI series, given its significant negative correlation with the averaged NLSIE in the 90°–140°W longitudinal band. The NLSIE in RS was reconstructed using the MSA concentration derived from the Ferrigno and Erebus Saddle ice cores. The NLSIE in IndWPac was reconstructed using MSA records obtained from the LGB69 and Law Dome ice cores. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to verify the reconstruction results, and the transfer function in each sector was demonstrated to be valid."

The MSA concentration in the Ferrigno ice core was shown to be a robust proxy for winter SIE in RS for the period of 1703–2010.

For the entire Antarctic, our composite NLSIE shows a decreasing trend (-0.03°/decade, 99% confidence level) during the 20th century, with a rapid decline in the mid-1950s. A comparison with major climate indices shows that the long-term linear trends in all five sectors are largely dominated by the changes in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The multi-decadal variability in WS, BS, and AS is dominated by the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, whereas that in the IndWPac and RS is dominated by the SAM."

In the Bellingshausen Sea (BS), the annual net accumulation record from the Bruce Plateau ice core is used. For the Amundsen Sea (AS), the SOFI series is utilized due to its significant negative correlation with the averaged NLSIE in the 90°–140°W longitudinal band. The Ross Sea (RS) uses MSA concentration derived from the Ferrigno and Erebus Saddle ice cores, while the Indian and western Pacific Ocean (IndWPac) relies on MSA records from the LGB69 and Law Dome ice cores. The leave-one-out cross-validation method is applied to verify the reconstruction results, ensuring the validity of the transfer function in each sector.",

This process is repeated for each data point, allowing for the assessment of the model's predictive power and accuracy. The results from the cross-validation are used to validate the transfer function applied in each sector, ensuring that the reconstruction model is robust and reliable.",

There is also a discrepancy between climate models and observations, likely due to climate forcing rather than sea ice physics. Considerable uncertainties arise from individual proxies and different indicators used. These challenges can be addressed by further validating reconstructions and unifying quantization methods. Using paleoclimate archives is a crucial approach for reconstructing past sea ice states, allowing for more accurate estimations of internal and external forcings in Antarctic sea ice variability.",
