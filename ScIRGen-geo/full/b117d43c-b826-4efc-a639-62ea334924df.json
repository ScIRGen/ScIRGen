            "description": "This dataset contains daily land surface evapotranspiration products of 2018 in Qilian Mountain area. It has 0.01 degree spatial resolution. The dataset was produced based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method by fusing six satellite-derived evapotranspiration products including RS-PM (Mu et al., 2011), SW (Shuttleworth and Wallace., 1985), PT-JPL (Fisher et al., 2008), MS-PT (Yao et al., 2013), SEMI-PM (Wang et al., 2010a) and SIM (Wang et al.2008). The input variables for the evapotranspiration products include MODIS products and China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (He Jie, Yang Kun. China Meteorological Forcing Dataset. Cold and Arid Regions Science Data Center at Lanzhou, 2011. doi:10.3972/westdc.002.2014.db).",
