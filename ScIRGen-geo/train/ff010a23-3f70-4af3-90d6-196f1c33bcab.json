                "Mid-latitude Alpine snow cover is characterized by rapid seasonal changes and large spatial variations, which play important roles in energy changes, climate, water resources and ecological processes (Dozier and Painter2004). Known as Asia’s water tower, the glaciers and snowpack over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) provide the headwater for several major rivers in Asia (Xu, Ramanathan, and Washington2016). The water supplied by this region affects approximately 50–60% of the world’s population in China and parts of Asia (Barnett, Adam, and Lettenmaier 2005). Snow cover maps provide information about the spatial extent of the snow cover and are very useful for snow-related research. The snow cover on the plateau has important influences on the atmospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere but also directly affect the climatic and eco-environmental evolution of China (Qin, Liu, and Li2006). Due to the remoteness, topographic complexity and the relative sparsity of meteorological observation over the QTP, remote sensing is the most practical tool for monitoring a snow-covered area over the QTP. Although the snow algorithm developed by the MODIS data group can separate snow from the most obscuring clouds, daily MODIS data still have a relatively high cloud-covered fraction (as high as 47.3% over the QTP according to Tang et al. (2013). The first cloud-free snow cover products were derived from the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System of the NOAA/NESDIS (Brown et al.2014). The other three snow cover products (MOD-SSM/I, MOD-B, TAI) are essentially produced by MODIS snow cover data."

Based on the assessment, an I-TAI (Improvement of Terra–Aqua–IMS) snow product was proposed, which can improve the accuracy to some extent."

                "However, the algorithms of the MODIS series products show instability when identifying wet snow and snow under forest cover over the QTP. The snow misclassification is an important limitation of MODIS snow cover products and requires additional improvements. Although the snow algorithm developed by the MODIS data group can separate snow from the most obscuring clouds, daily MODIS data still have a relatively high cloud-covered fraction (as high as 47.3% over the QTP according to Tang et al. (2013). Cloud cover can significantly limit the application of MODIS snow products (López-Burgos, Gupta, and Clark2013; Parajka and Blöschl 2006; Wang et al.2009)."

When the cloud pixels were at elevations higher than 5800 m, they could also be assigned to a snow-covered pixel. The fourth step was based on the spatial combination of adjacent pixels. Four direct‘side-bordering’ adjacent pixels of the cloud pixel were examined. If at least three of four pixels are defined as snow, then the cloud pixel was also assigned to snow. The last steps adopt the model of the snowline. The aim of this step was to identify the minimum elevation where snow exists and the snow-covered elevation where all pixels above this level were covered by snow. Next, these elevation lines are set as threshold elevations to remove the cloud pixels. The first step consists of the Terra/Aqua combination described above, and the second step is the combination of MODIS images and IMS data."

The Khat values of the IMS, MOD-SSM/I, MOD-B and TAI products were 0.084, 0.463, 0.428 and 0.526, respectively.
