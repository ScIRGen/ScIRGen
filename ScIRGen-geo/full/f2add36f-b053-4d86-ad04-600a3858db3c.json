            "description": "Tree cores of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) in central and eastern Qilian Mountains were collected. The samples were measured using the Velmex measuring system with a precision of 0.001 mm. To ensure the accuracy of dating, the results were tested with CHFECHA and TASP program. The computer program ARSTAN was used for detrending and for calculating the tree-ring chronologies. Conventional straight lines and negative exponential curves were used to detrend most of the tree-ring series, but a cubic smoothing spline with a 67% of the series length was used in a few cases if the previous two curves did not provide a good fit. Finally, tree-ring chronologies were obtained.",
            "instructions": "The tree-ring chronologies are saved in Sheets in an excel file according to the site name, such as LCHS chronology kept in Sheet LCHS. In each Sheet, the \"year\" for years, and the \"STD\" for the standardized tree-ring width chronology. \nMethod of data read: the file can be opened with Excel and other software.",

These objectives influence the choice of data collection and analysis methods by necessitating precise measurement techniques, such as using the Velmex width measurement tool to achieve millimeter-level accuracy, and employing cross-dating verification with programs like CHFECHA and TASP to ensure the accuracy of the dating process. Additionally, the use of ARSTAN for detrending data with negative exponential or linear functions, and employing spline functions for poorly fitting samples, are critical to achieving reliable and consistent results that align with the research goals.",

These samples are then subjected to laboratory processing, which involves fixing, sanding, and preliminary cross-dating of the cores. Tree-ring widths are measured using a Velmex measuring system at a precision of 0.001 mm. The CHFECHA and TASP programs are used for cross-dating and measurement validation to ensure accuracy. Finally, detrending is performed using the ARSTAN program with negative exponential or linear functions, and for poorly fitting samples, a spline function with a span of 67% of the series length is used to establish a chronology for each sampling site.",
