            "description": "This data set is composed of principal and trace element analysis data of different particle size components of stari slankamen loess comprehensive profile in Serbia. There are two sets of particle size samples in total. One set is divided according to the Uddin Wentworth particle size standard. A single sample is divided into six particle size samples, which are < 2 μ m、2-4  μ m、4-8  μ m、8-16  μ m、16-32  μ M and 32-63 μ M component, 102 samples in total; The other set divides a single sample into < 10 μ M and 10-63 μ M two components, a total of 52 samples. The contents of major and trace elements in each sample were determined by Axios wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) manufactured by panalytical company and nexion300d inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) manufactured by Perkin Elmer company, The experimental analysis was completed in the Key Laboratory of Cenozoic geology and environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of analysis and testing, Beijing Institute of geology, China nuclear industry. The data can be applied to determine the particle size effect of element geochemical indexes of loess in the westerly affected area, and has important guiding significance for loess provenance discrimination and paleoclimate research by using element geochemical indexes.",

This enables researchers to study the grain size effect on geochemical indicators and aids in determining the provenance of loess materials and reconstructing paleoclimate conditions.",
