            "description": "This data set includes SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating and O isotope data of Banpo Yakou ophiolite in the eastern part of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and western Yunnan. The data are from the research team of Zhai Qingguo, Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The formation and evolution history of the ancient Tethys suture zone in western Yunnan has always been the focus of Tethys research. In recent years, with the support of the second scientific research project, the team has carried out a detailed field geological survey of Banpo Yakou ophiolite in Lancang Puer area, western Yunnan. On this basis, based on high-precision (ion probe) U-Pb dating and O isotope analysis of zircon in gabbro and plagiogranite, The formation age of ophiolite in this area (313~305 Ma) has been recovered, and its O isotope is a typical depleted mantle source area（ δ 18O value is about 5.5 ‰). On this basis, combined with the whole rock geochemical study, it is considered that the ophiolites in this area are of typical back arc basin origin, and the Late Carboniferous Paleo Tethys trench arc system has been reconstructed. In addition, the data further include zircon Hf isotope of Banpo ophiolite and zircon U-Pb geochronology of Mengku Shuangjiang ophiolite recently obtained by the project team. These data were obtained by using high-precision secondary ion probe (SHRIMP II) at the Beijing Ion Probe Center, and zircon Hf isotope data were obtained by (MC) - LA-ICP-MS multi receiver plasma mass spectrometry. The data quality is excellent, and can be used for the comparative study of the formation and evolution of Tethys on the Tibetan Plateau and the evolution of the oceans.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing high precision ion probe U-Pb dating and O isotope analysis on zircon minerals can lead to a more accurate determination of ophiolite formation ages, which in the case of the studied region are identified as 313 ~ 305 Ma. This approach also provides insights into the O isotope characteristics, indicating a typical depleted mantle source (with δ18O values around 5.5‰), which helps in reconstructing the tectonic history and understanding the genesis of the ophiolites as back-arc basin origins. This data can be used in broader comparisons of Tethys evolution and oceanic processes.",
