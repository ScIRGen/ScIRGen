            "description": "Soil freeze depth (SFD) is essential for assessing water balance, surface energy exchange, and biogeochemical cycles in permafrost regions. It serves as an important indicator of climate change in the cryosphere, with significant implications for both seasonal and perennially frozen ground. Due to the influence of climate warming, the permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau has undergone notable changes, characterized by increased ground temperatures, degradation of perennially frozen ground, and reduced SFD. The future decrease in SFD will have significant impacts on the ecological environment, hydrology, and engineering infrastructure of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the Stefan equation and the downscaled CMIP6 datasets under different scenarios (Historical, SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) derived from multiple models (such as BCC-CSM2-MR, CanESM5, CESM2, CMCC-ESM2, and CNRM-CM6-1), the annual soil freeze depth datasets of the Tibetan Plateau from 1950 to 2099 are obtained, with a spatial resolution of 0.25°.The datasets play a supportive role in predicting changes in permafrost, disaster prevention and control, and environmental assessment.",
            "instructions": "The datasets are stored as follows: there are separate folders for each model, and within each model folder, the datasets for five different scenarios (Historical, SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) are stored. Within each folder, the datasets are organized by year, with each file named as SFD_yyyy.nc, where yyyy represents the year. The datasets are in NetCDF format and can be opened and read using the ArcGIS software.",
