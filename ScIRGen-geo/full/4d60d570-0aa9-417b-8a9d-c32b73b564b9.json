            "description": "The dataset of LAI measurements was obtained by LI-3000, the protractor and the ruler in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas on May, 20, 24, 25, 28 and 31, Jun. 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 21 and 27, Jul. 2 and 9, 2008.\n     The maximum leaf length and width of maize and wheat, the leaf angle, length and width of each section (one leaf was divided into 3 sections) were measured. And also the plant height, leaf base height, the crop spacing, the canopy height, row spacing and ridge spacing were measured. Two representative plants would be taken back for indoor observation for the stem length, stem width, stem circumference, and leaf area by LAI3000. Data were archived in Excel format.",

Accurate LAI retrieval is always a key task of such remote-sensing applications, and it is also a precondition of crop-yield estimation, vegetative evapotranspiration calculation and the energy-exchange evaluation of terrestrial vegetation (Badhwar et al., 1986; Townshend et al., 1988; Baret et al., 1991; Wood et al., 1993; Bonan, 1995; Bicheron et al., 1999; Buermann et al., 2001; Kamalesh et al., 2008). In general, there are three categories of LAI retrieval methods. The first category is experiential inversion method based on Vegetation Index (VI), such as retrieving LAI according to the correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LAI (Turner, 1999; Brown et al., 2000; Haboudane et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005). Although such an approach is simple and widely-used, its accuracy is very low, and some VI can easily get saturated. The second category can be called the reflectance model inversion method, by which the anisotropic effect caused by sun-object-sensor geometry can be removed, but the effect caused by background variations cannot be avoided, especially within mixed pixels. The complex background inhibits accurate LAI retrieval (Li et al., 1986; Nilson et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1997; Xu, 2005)."

It is used to quantify the amount of biomass produced within an ecosystem over a unit of time, regardless of the amount of respiration. The seasonal difference of GPP and ecosystem respiration (Re) determines the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between the atmosphere and forest ecosystems and is important for understanding global carbon cycle climate change research. The eddy covariance (EC) technique is one of the best micrometeorological methods for the estimation of CO2, water, and energy exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing provides consistent and systematic land surface observations and has played an increasing role in characterizing vegetation structure and estimating GPP. The fundamental methodology of GPP estimation is based on Monteith’s equation: GPP ¼ LUE /C2 fAPAR /C2 PAR, where LUE is the light use efficiency, often in units of mol CO2 per mol photosynthetic photon flux density (mol CO2 mol−1 PPFD), and fAPAR represents the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Many models and methods using the LUE basis have been proposed for GPP estimation from ground measurements and satellite remote sensing data."

The limitation of LUE models, however, is that they require meteorological inputs that are often not available at sufficiently detailed temporal and spatial scales, resulting in substantial errors in the outputs.
