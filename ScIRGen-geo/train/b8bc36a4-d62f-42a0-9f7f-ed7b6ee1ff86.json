                "Atmospheric aerosols are composed of solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles are directly emitted into the atmosphere or formed through gas–particle transformation with diverse shapes and sizes, optical properties, and components. Most atmospheric aerosols are concentrated in the troposphere, especially in the boundary layer, with a high concentration near emission sources, and a small portion are distributed in the stratosphere. Atmospheric aerosols severely impact the atmospheric environment and human health. Aerosols are inextricably linked to climate change. Atmospheric aerosols alter the Earth’s energy budget and affect the climate. Tropospheric aerosols are considered the second-largest forcing factor for global climate change, and they reduce the warming attributable to greenhouse gases by −0.5 °C. However, aerosols are also regarded as the largest contributor to the uncertainty of present-day climate change attribution. Therefore, it is crucial to have sufficient aerosol observations. AOD is an important physical quantity for estimating the content, atmospheric pollution, and climatology of aerosols. AOD data usually come from ground-based and satellite-borne remote sensing observations. Ground-based remote sensing observations supply aerosol loading data (such as AOD) by measuring the attenuation of radiation from the top of the atmosphere to the surface. Satellite remote sensing is a space-based method that can provide aerosol properties worldwide. Satellite remote sensing overcomes the limitations of spatial coverage. To overcome these limitations and enrich aerosol data, alternative observation data could be utilized to derive AOD. Atmospheric horizontal visibility is a suitable alternative because it has the advantages of long-term records with a large number of stations worldwide. These studies have enriched AOD data regionally and have also enriched aerosol data to some extent.",
                "The core problems of the regression tree that need to be solved are to find the optimal split variable and optimal split point. A regression tree corresponds to a split in the feature space and the output values on the split domains. When the partition of the input space is determined, the square error can be used to represent the prediction error of the regression tree for the training data, and the minimizing square error is used to solve the optimal output value on each domain.",
                "Ground-based 15 min AOD observations are available from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3.0 Level 2.0 product at 395 sites, which can be downloaded from https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov (last access: 9 July 2024). The AERONET program is a federation of ground-based remote sensing aerosol networks established by NASA and PHOTONS, including many subnetworks. AERONET has three levels of AOD products: Level 1.0 (unscreened), Level 1.5 (cloud screened), and Level 2.0 (cloud screened and quality assured). The monthly AOD (550 nm) dataset of Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) from 1980 to 2021 is a NASA reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625°.",

Dust and biomass burning have an influence on AOD. The AOD level at the regional scale shows significant differences from 1980 to 2021, which is strongly related to the aerosol emission source types, transportation, and implementation of laws and regulations for pollution control."

In this study, we propose a machine learning method to derive AOD, where satellite AOD is the target value and visibility and other related meteorological variables are the predictors. This study is aimed at supporting the research of aerosols in climate change detection and attribution.",

            "challenges": [
                "Global ground-based AOD observations are sparsely distributed, and satellite AOD retrievals have a low temporal frequency as well low accuracy before 2000 over land. However, ground-based remote sensing observations only provide aerosol properties with low spatial coverage. Many studies have only investigated the trends and distributions of aerosols after 2000 because of the lack of long-term and global-cover AOD products, which is a bottleneck for aerosol climate change detection and attribution. The two physical quantities of visibility and AOD have similarities and differences that make it challenging to retrieve AOD from visibility. Obtaining the vertical structure of aerosols is the greatest challenge, as it is not a simple hypothetical curve in complex terrain and circulation conditions.",
                "When the aerosol loading is low, the error is significant. When the AOD at 440 nm wavelength is less than 0.2, the error is 0.01, which is equivalent to the error of the absorption band in the total optical depth. When dealing with imbalanced datasets, because of the tendency of machine learning algorithms to perform better on the majority class and overlook the minority class, the model may be underfit."

The ground-based hourly meteorological data from 1959 to 2021 are collected from 5032 meteorological stations at airports over land. The daily average visibility is calculated using the harmonic mean. The hourly boundary layer height (BLH) data from 1980 to 2021 are available from the Fifth Generation Reanalysis of the European Medium-Range Weather Forecast Center (ERA5) with a resolution of 0.25° ×0.25°.",

We set X=[x1x2,...,x N] as the predictors: xi =(x1 i,x2 i,...x n i ), i=1,2,3...,N , where n is the feature number and N is the length of sample. We set a training dataset as D= [(x1,y1)(x2,y2),..., (xN,yN)]. A heuristic method is used to split the feature space. After each split, all values of all features in the current set are examined individually, and the optimal one is selected as the split point based on the principle of the minimum sum of the square errors. For the training dataset, we recursively divide each region into two subdomains and calculate the output values of each subdomain; then, we construct a binary decision tree. We use the optimal split variable xj and the optimal split point s to split the feature space and calculate the corresponding output value: ˆc1 =ave(yi|xi ∈R1(j,s)), ˆc2 =ave(yi|xi ∈R2(j,s)). We traverse all input variables to find the optimal split variable xj, forming a pair (j,s). We divide the input space into two regions accordingly. Next, we repeat the above process for each region until the stop condition is met. The regression tree is generated.",
                "The F test is used to search for the optimal feature subset in the predictor, aiming to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features and select truly relevant features, which helps to simplify the model’s input and improve the model’s prediction ability.
