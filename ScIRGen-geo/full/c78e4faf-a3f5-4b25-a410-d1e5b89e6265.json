Remote sensing has become widely used as a macro-observing system for land-cover mapping, which can substitute for plant functional type (PFT) as the baseline. Several moderate to fine resolution global land-cover datasets, which are presented in detail in Table I, based on different satellite sensors are available from different research groups. These land-cover datasets listed in Table I have large variability for three reasons: 1) the data quality and properties are different; 2) there is no standard approach for classifying continuous vegetation cover into discrete categories; and 3) they are not consistent with the Earth System Model’s (ESM) requirements, because the concept of PFT, whose traits represent a combination of spectral relationships, and climatic, ecological, and theoretical assumptions, used in ESMs cannot be mapped directly using remote-sensing land-cover datasets. In addition, the classification accuracies of land-cover datasets vary and are hardly suited for land-process modeling and applications at a river basin scale. The highest uncertainty in land-cover classification from optical remotely sensed imagery occurs most frequently between the cropland and grassland categories and in dryland systems among the shrub, grassland, and forest categories because of differences in the minimum threshold required for forest cover. For the HRB, most are distributed over an arid region, so the vegetation classification in the HRB based on current land-cover datasets would cause very large uncertainty and may cause great error or even the failure of eco-hydrological and land-process modeling."

Although several moderate to fine resolution global land cover datasets have been publicly released and they show strong consistency at the global scale, they have large deviations at the regional scale; furthermore, high-quality land cover datasets from before 2000 are not available and the classification consistency among different datasets is not very good. Remote sensing has become widely used for global land cover mapping, as it can capture the changes of land cover quickly. Until now, several moderate to fine resolution global land cover datasets have been publicly released and the spatial resolutions of these products are between 1 km and 30 m. They show strong consistency at the global scale, but they have large deviations at the regional scale. The main problems include: (1) most of the land cover datasets have a relatively low resolution (500 m and lower) and their accuracies are usually lower than 75%; among the released datasets, GlobeLand30 and FROM-GLC30 have a spatial resolution of 30 m, and their overall accuracies are 80% and 72% respectively; (2) the classification accuracy of these released datasets at the regional scale is much lower than the claimed accuracy, especially at heterogeneous areas, which is difficult to meet the modeling requirements, and (3) all the datasets are after 2000 and do not have long time series and therefore cannot support the analysis of long-term climate, environmental, and ecological changes."
