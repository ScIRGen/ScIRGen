            "description": "This data is the geochemical data of trace elements and U-Pb ages of zircons from Dexing porphyry Cu deposit, Jiangxi Province. The samples are granodiorite from Tongchang and Fujiawu mines. Zircons include magmatic zircons and inherited zircons. Zircon U-Pb ages and trace element data were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS in Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The above data have been published in the high-level SCI Journal (Geochimica et Cosmochimica ACTA), and the data are true and reliable. The oxygen fugacity of magmatic zircons and inherited zircons with different ages can be calculated by the zircon age and trace element data, so as to study the reason for the change of redox conditions in Dexing copper mine. The source of Cu in the copper mine can be further inferred by the influence of oxygen fugacity on partial melting.",
            "instructions": "The data is stored in Excel file and can be opened directly in Excel workbook. The file named \"Zrn_Tra\" represents the trace element geochemical data of zircon, \"Zrn_UPb\" represents zircon U-Pb age data.",
