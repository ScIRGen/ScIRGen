            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in No.2 quadrate of the A'rou foci experimental area on Oct. 17, 2007 during the pre-observation period. \n    The Envisat ASAR data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 23:04 BJT. The quadrate was divided into 3×3 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. 25 sampling points were chosen, including centers and corners of each subsites.\n      Simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected, soil volumetric moisture by ML2X; soil volumetric moisture, soil conductivity, soil temperature, and the real part of soil complex permittivity by WET soil moisture sensor; the surface radiative temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer; soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3). Meanwhile, vegetation parameters as height, coverage and water content were also observed. Surface roughness was detailed in the \"WATER: Surface roughness dataset in the A'rou foci experimental area\".\n    Those provide reliable ground data for retrieval and validation of soil moisture and freeze/thaw status from active remote sensing approaches.",

In contrast, ML2X and WET instruments are ground-based, capturing detailed soil volumetric moisture content, electrical conductivity, soil temperature, and dielectric constant at specific sample points within a 3Grid×3Grid area, allowing for direct measurement and validation of satellite data.",

In the Aruo sampling site, synchronized with the Envisat ASAR satellite pass, soil volumetric moisture content is measured using ML2X and WET soil moisture rapid measurement instruments. Additional parameters such as electrical conductivity, soil temperature, and the real part of the soil complex dielectric constant are also measured. Surface radiative temperature is obtained using a handheld infrared thermometer. Soil samples are collected using a 100cm^3 ring knife for drying to obtain weight moisture content, soil bulk density, and volumetric moisture content. Vegetation parameters like height, coverage, and water content are surveyed. Surface roughness information is documented separately. These procedures collectively provide a comprehensive dataset for validating remote sensing algorithms.",
