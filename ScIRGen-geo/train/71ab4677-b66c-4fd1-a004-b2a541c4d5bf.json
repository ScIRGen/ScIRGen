            "titleEn": "1-km monthly mean temperature dataset for china (1901-2023)",
            "description": "This dataset includes the monthly mean temperature data with 0.0083333 arc degree (~1km)  for China from Jan 1901 to Dec 2023. The data form belongs to NETCDF, namely .nc file. The unit of the data is 0.1 ℃. The dataset was spatially downscaled from CRU TS v4.02 with WorldClim datasets based on Delta downscaling method. The dataset was evaluated by 496 national weather stations across China, and the evaluation indicated that the downscaled dataset is reliable for the investigations related to climate change across China. The dataset covers the main land area of China, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions, and excluding islands and reefs in South China Sea. WGS84 is recommended for data coordinate system.",
            "instructions": "Stored in NC format, the file name is \"tmp_yyyy. nc\", where yyyy is the year. Each NC file contains 12 time points, representing January to December. To reduce storage capacity, all files have been compressed and stored, such as tmp_yyyy.rar. The nc format can be opened using the ArcGIS multidimensional data tool, or Matlab, R, and so on. Note: Each NC file has 12 layers. If opened in ArcMap, you can select the time dimension. Selecting 1 represents January, selecting 7 represents July, and so on; If the time dimension is not selected by default, when the data is opened, it defaults to the first layer, which is January. The nc file can be opened in the Make NetCDF Raster Layer tool under the Multidimensional Tools in the ArcMap toolbox. After the dialog box opens, you can select time under Dimension Values (optional), and click on the value to see a list of values 1-12. Select one of the months to complete the process; Alternatively, after opening the nc file by default, the first layer (January) will be displayed. Then, under the layer properties, click on the NETCDF property card and select the value list for the time dimension, which will show 1-12. Choose one of the months to complete the process. If performing grid calculations and other operations in ArcMap, it is recommended to export as a grid data entity and store it on the hard drive after selecting the month, as the loaded nc data is still a temporary data in memory. After exporting as a raster data entity, it is recommended to provide the WGS84 coordinate system before starting the analysis operation. When giving WGS84, find the exported raster data entity in the Catalog, click on its properties, find the Spatial Reference property, click on Edit to open the coordinate system option, find World in Geographic Coordinate Systems (i.e. geodetic coordinate system), and select WGS 1984 under it. Afterwards, the projection system and other operations can be assigned, if necessary.",

                    "Answer": "The need for spatial downscaling arises because global climate datasets, such as those from CRU and WorldClim, are typically at a coarser resolution (0.5°) and do not capture the finer spatial variations in temperature at a local level. To generate a high-resolution dataset with approximately 1km resolution, a Delta spatial downscaling method was used, which allows for more detailed representation of temperature variations across China's diverse geographical regions.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of developing a high-resolution temperature dataset for China with a spatial resolution of 1km over an extended period from 1901 to 2023 is to provide detailed climate information that can be used for various research and practical applications. This includes understanding climate change patterns, supporting agricultural planning, and aiding in ecological and environmental management. The dataset aims to enhance the resolution of existing global datasets through spatial downscaling techniques, making the data more applicable for localized studies and decision-making processes.",
