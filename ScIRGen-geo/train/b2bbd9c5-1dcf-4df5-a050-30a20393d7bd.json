            "description": "The dataset of surface roughness measurements was obtained in the reed plot A, the saline plots B and C of the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jun. 7, 18 and 25, 2008. \n    All the quadrates were divided into 4×4 subsites, with each one spanning a 120×120 m2 plot. With the roughness plate 110cm long and the measuring points distance 1cm, the samples were collected from south to north and from east to west, respectively.\n    The coordinates of the sample would be got with the help of ArcView; and after geometric correction, surface height standard deviation (cm) and correlation length (cm) could be acquired based on the formula listed on pages 234-236, Microwave Remote Sensing, Vol. II.\n    The original photos of each sampling point, surface height standard deviation (cm) and correlation length (cm) were included this dataset. The roughness data were initialized with the sample name, which was followed by the serial number, the name of the file, standard deviation and correlation length. Each .txt file is matched with one sample photo and standard deviation and correlation length represent the roughness. In addition, the length of 101 needles is also included for further checking.",

                "Radar remote sensing has demonstrated its applicability to the retrieval of basin-scale soil moisture. The mechanism of radar backscattering from soils is complicated and strongly influenced by surface roughness. Surface soil moisture (mv) is important in agronomic, hydrological, and meteorological processes at all spatial scales. The ability of inferring mv using both active and passive microwave techniques has been intensively demonstrated. It is well known that space-borne microwave radiometers and scatterometers possess the advantage of high revisit capacity but are deficient in coarse spatial resolution. On the contrary, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors have the capability to provide finer spatial resolution, on the order of tens of meters, meeting most spatial requirements for watershed management and hydrological applications. The advanced IEM (AIEM) improves the calculation accuracy of scattering coefficient by keeping the absolute phase term in Greens function which was neglected by IEM. In the IEM and AIEM, surface roughness is an essential input, thus, if only a single configuration (e.g., one polarization, one frequency) of radar data is available, roughness parameters should be known as a priori information in order to retrieve soil moisture using these models."

Then, the deduced roughness parameters were used for the retrieval of soil moisture in association with the AIEM.

During the field campaigns conducted in the intensive observation period (IOP) from May to August 2008, five experimental sites (ESs), each 360 × 360 m 2 in size, were established.
