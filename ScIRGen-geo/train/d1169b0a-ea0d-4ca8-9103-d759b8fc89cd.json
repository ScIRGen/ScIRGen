            "description": "This dataset is based on the sixth edition of the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index  product (2001-2014) jointly released by NASA EOSDIS LP DAAC and the US Geological Survey USGS EROS. The NDVI has a time resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution of 0.05 degree. First,the NDVI data products were re-sampled from the spatial resolution of 0.05 degree to 0.5 degree, then the time series of every year was smoothed by the double-logistic method, and the smoothed curvature was calculated. The maximum curvature of spring was selected as the returning green stage of the vegetation in Spring. This data can be used to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of the Holarctic vegetation phenology in Spring.",

                "Vegetation phenology is the study of the seasonal life cycle of plants controlled by seasonal and interannual climate change. A shift in phenological timing has been documented in the past half century in response to ongoing climate change. The 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesized multiple studies to conclude that spring greenup (SG), the time at which plants begin to grow leaves in northern mid- and high-latitudes, has advanced at a rate of between 1.1 and 5.2 days decade-1 over different periods and regions. Temperature has long been recognized as the dominant factor that alters SG, and that its effects differ between plant species. Accurate representation of phenological processes in climate models is essential to predict mass and energy exchange between land and the atmosphere and the response of surface exchange processes to climate change."

The main objectives of this work are to explore, across biomes and in observations and ESMs: (1) the preseason when climate exerts significant control on the SG, (2) the sensitivity of the SG to preseason temperature and precipitation, and (3) historical trends in the SG and their associated climate controls."

Multiple studies indicate that land surface schemes used in current ESMs do not place sufficient emphasis on accurately modeling seasonality of ecosystem processes that affect vegetation phenology. The discrepancies in preseason climate and its spatial and temporal trends indicate that constraints on spatial and temporal variations of preseason climate are weak."

We compared these observed responses to the simulated SG responses to preseason climate inferred from the Earth System Models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) over 1982-2005. We used the first ensemble member from 11 ESMs to infer SG from monthly leaf area index (LAI) between 1982 and 2005, which we chose to be consistent with the period of GIMMS NDVI data. We regridded GIMMS NDVI3g data to half-degree resolution using a bilinear method to match the spatial resolution of the CRU-NCEP reanalysis. We determined the preseason following the method of Shen et al. (2014), but with a different climate reanalysis product and method for calculating the SG."

The daily mean temperature (Tm) and cumulative precipitation (Pc) are calculated from 6-hourly, half-degree resolution CRU-NCEP (Climate Research Unit-National Centers for Environmental Prediction) v6 reanalysis to analyze the preseason climate associated with SG derived from GIMMS NDVI."

Most ESMs, except BCC-CSM1, GFDL-ESM2G, and NorESM1-M, predicted advanced the SG north of the mid-latitudes, although the ESMs tended to predict larger SG advances than those from the GIMMS retrievals. The GIMMS-derived zonal mean SG advances throughout most of the 35-80°N latitude range. The GIMMS-derived SG indicates that the deciduous broadleaf forest biome has experienced the largest SG advance (3.1 days decade-1)."

                "Vegetation phenology plays an important role in regulating land-atmosphere energy, water, and trace-gas exchanges. As the time spanned by satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products has increased to longer periods, several studies have used NDVI to derive spring greenup time (SG) at regional and global scales. Several changes in SG have been documented in the past half-century in response to ongoing climate change. The Northern Hemisphere SG has advanced in the range of 0-12 days per decade as inferred by NDVI. The wide range of SG shifts stem from studies covering different periods and regions, and different methods and datasets that have been applied to derive phenology metrics. Many factors associated with the obtaining of satellite data—e.g., drift of satellite orbits, calibration uncertainties, inter-satellite sensor differences, bidirectional and atmospheric effects—may cause uncertainties in satellite-derived data time series and thereby the uncertainties in interpreting the vegetation dynamics. Four NDVI products have been published based on radiances collected by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments carried by programs of NOAA/NASA Pathfinder (PAL): Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS), Land Long Term Data Record (LTDR) version 3 (V3) and Fourier-Adjustment, Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated Reconstructed (FASIR). Each of these records extends back to the year 1981. Because of their long time span, the AVHRR NDVI products have been applied in numerous regional to global vegetation phenology studies. Advantages are recognized for GIMMS NDVI over the other AVHRR NDVI products to represent the temporal variation of NDVI."

In the regions with advanced SG, GIMMS inferred much weaker advancement whereas in the regions with delayed SG, GIMMS inferred much stronger delay than MODIS. This resulted in a GIMMS SG delay in both North America and Eurasia. MODIS data show no significant SG shift in North American for spatial heterogeneity in SG shift, but dominant SG advancement in Eurasia. The SG advancement inferred from MODIS is associated with a stronger coupling between SG and temperature and a stronger sensitivity across biomes as compared to GIMMS. The main uncertainty in the SG trend and SG-temperature sensitivity are in northern high latitudes (>50°N) where GIMMS and MODIS show different magnitude and sign of the annual SG anomalies."
