Data content: This data includes hourly hemisphere surface temperature data of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau region calculated based on the Fengyun-4A satellite, as well as quality identification data. The time range is from January 2015 to December 2023, providing long-term 0.01 ° resolution hemisphere surface temperature data. 2. Data source and processing method: The data source is the website of the National Satellite Meteorological Center, which is a dataset processed through angle correction, cloud temperature reconstruction based on machine learning and energy balance, and hybrid downscaling methods. 3. Data quality description: For quality control data QC, when QC=0, the pixel represents clear sky temperature, and when QC=1, the pixel represents cloud temperature. 4. Data application achievements and prospects: This data and method have not been published yet.",
