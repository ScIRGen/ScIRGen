            "description": "Known as the \"Asian water tower\", the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is the source of many rivers in Southeast Asia. As an important and easily accessible water resource, the runoff provided by it supports the production and life of billions of people around it and the diversity of the ecosystem. The glacier runoff data set in the five river source areas of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau covers the period from 2005 to 2010, with a time resolution of every five years. It covers the source areas of the five major rivers in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (the source of the Yellow River, the source of the Yangtze River, the source of the Lancang River, the source of the Nujiang River, and the source of the Yarlung Zangbo River). The spatial resolution is 1km. Based on multi-source remote sensing, simulation, statistics, and measured data, GIS methods and ecological economics methods are used, The value of water resources service in the cryosphere in the source area of the river and river is quantified, and all its data are subject to quality control.",

The GIS and ecological economics approach integrates multiple data sources such as remote sensing, simulations, statistics, and actual measurements, enabling a spatially distributed analysis with a high resolution of 1 km. This method provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of water resource values, which may not be as easily captured by traditional methods that might focus more on localized or point-specific data collection.",
