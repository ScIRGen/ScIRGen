            "description": "This dataset contains land cover products in Qilian Mountain Area in 2018. The dataset was produced by two steps. Firstly, land cover product in 2015 is produced using time series Landsat-8/OLI data. In view of the different NDVI time series curves of various land features with time variation, the knowledge of different land features is summarized, the extraction rules of different land features are set, and the land cover classification map in 2015 is obtained. The classification system refers to IGBP and FROM_LC classification system. It is divided into 10 categories: cultivated land, woodland, grassland, shrub, wetland, water body, impermeable surface, bare land, glacier and snow cover. According to the accuracy evaluation of Google Earth high-definition image and field survey data, the overall accuracy of land cover classification products in 2015 is as high as 92.19%. Secondly, taking the land cover classification products in 2015 as the base map, a large number of samples are selected according to the proportion of different types. Based on the Landsat series data and powerful data processing ability of Google Earth Engine platform, the random forest classifier is selected to train the band information and NDVI, MNDWI, NDBI and other indices by using the idea of in-depth learning. The land cover of 2018 is produced. It is concluded that the land cover classified products based on Google Earth Engine platform have good consistency with those based on time series method. In conclusion, the land cover data set in the core area of Qilian Mountains has high overall accuracy, and the method based on sample training of Google Earth Engine platform can expand the existing classification products in time and space, and the frequency of every five years can reflect more land cover type change information in long time series.",

The advantage of HJ-1/CCD data in land cover/use classification makes it a reference for new remote sensing satellite or sensor development. Overall, a new land cover/use classification method using HJ-1/CCD data based on time series analysis is developed and this method does improve the classification accuracy compared with the method using single remote sensing data. In addition, the introducing of the very high spatial resolution data within Google Earth can also improve the sampling accuracy and lower the cost of data purchasing and field campaigns."

The land cover classification method using time series HJ-1/CCD data includes six steps, which are detailed as follows: (1) Constructing the time series HJ-1/CCD data. In order to take advantages of HJ-1/CCD data for land cover mapping, the composite of experimental areas is made using multi-scenes of HJ-1/CCD images, and 12 composites corresponding to 12 months in 2010 are made, which are made up the time series images of the experimental areas yearly. (2) Data preprocessing. After the data are prepared, the data pre-processes including geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction need to be done to make a “perfect” time series HJ-1/CCD data composite. (3) NDVI calculating. Instead of time series of HJ-1/CCD data, time series of NDVI are used as the input of SVM for classification. (1) Sampling. The classifier used in this study is SVM, which needs a good sample set for training purpose. (2) SVM classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a robotic learning method developed from statistics learning theory and optimization theory in the 1990s. (3) Post-classification. Some of the land cover types are very difficult to separate, so some extra work needs to be done to improve the classification accuracy."

Remote sensing has become widely used as a macro-observing system for land-cover mapping, which can substitute for plant functional type (PFT) as the baseline. Several moderate to fine resolution global land-cover datasets, which are presented in detail in Table I, based on different satellite sensors are available from different research groups. These land-cover datasets listed in Table I have large variability for three reasons: 1) the data quality and properties are different; 2) there is no standard approach for classifying continuous vegetation cover into discrete categories; and 3) they are not consistent with the Earth System Model’s (ESM) requirements, because the concept of PFT, whose traits represent a combination of spectral relationships, and climatic, ecological, and theoretical assumptions, used in ESMs cannot be mapped directly using remote-sensing land-cover datasets. The highest uncertainty in land-cover classification from optical remotely sensed imagery occurs most frequently between the cropland and grassland categories and in dryland systems among the shrub, grassland, and forest categories because of differences in the minimum threshold required for forest cover."

Radiometric calibration: Converting the DN values of the HJ-1/CCD images to top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance with given calibration coefficients. Atmospheric correction: Removing the atmospheric effects of remote-sensing images to obtain the surface reflectance. This correction was achieved with a spatial extension method developed by [44].
