            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with EO-1 Hyperion was obtained in the Yingke oasis foci experimental area from Sep. 5 to Sep. 10, 2007 during the pre-observation period. It was carried out by the 3rd and 2nd sub-projects of CAS’s West Action Plan along Zhangye city-Yingke oasis-Huazhaizi, and on the very day of 10, one scene of Hyperion was captured.\n\nsampling plot\ttime\tnorth latitude\teast longitude\televation\tnotes\n1\t9:58\t38°53′53.2″\t100°26′09.7″\t1500\tcauliflower land east to the road \n2\t10:51\t38°52′39.8″\t100°25′33.1″\t1510\tcabbage land east to the road \n3\t11:35\t38°52′39.0″\t100°25′34.6″\t1510\teast to No. 2 sampling plot, maize and intercropping wheat reaped\n4\t12:24\t38°51′53.0″\t100°25′08.0″\t1510\tmaize seed\n5\t13:08\t38°51′54.2″\t100°25′09.5″\t1520\tnorth to No. 4 sampling plot, maize and intercropping wheat reaped\n6\t14:40\t38°51′23.5″\t100°24′45.0″\t1510\twest to the road, maize seed, serious blights (red spider)\n7\t15:40\t38°49′26.6″\t100°23′23.7″\t1540\t intercrop land of sea buckthorn and beet\n8\t16:18\t38°49′06.9″\t100°23′30.5″\t1540\ttomato land, rich of amaranth weeds\n9\t16:18\t38°49′06.4″\t100°23′30.8″\t1540\tbeet land\n10\t16:18\t38°49′06.9″\t100°23′30.5″\t1540\ttomato land with less weeds\n11\t10:30\t38°48′28.3″\t100°24′11.4″\t1540\tsea buckthorn seedling land west to the road\n12\t11:24\t38°48′09.3″\t100°24′10.1″\t1550\tsun flower land east to the road, intercropping wheat reaped\n13\t12:38\t38°46′16.3″\t100°23′14.2″\t1600\tdry rice land\n14\t12:45\t38°46′16.2″\t100°23′14.0″\t1600\trape land\n15\t12:54\t38°46′15.6″\t100°23′13.8″\t1600\tbuckwheat land\n16\t14:52\t38°45′55.5″\t100°23′00.1″\t1610\tmaize (without intercrop)\n17\t15:28\t38°45′57.5″\t100°22′28.3″\t1630\tmaize (without intercrop)\n18\t16:20\t38°43′17.3″\t100°22′53.4″\t1730\tgobi  (Bassia dasyphylla and margarite dominate)\n19\t17:40\t38°42′31.8″\t100°22′56.8″\t1780\tgobi  (Bassia dasyphylla and Sympegma regelii dominate)\n20\t10:27\t38°36′25.1″\t100°20′33.2″\t2260\twheatgrass dominates\n21\t11:10\t38°36′24.4″\t100°20′38.1″\t2260\tabandoned composite land\n22\t11:30\t                \t\t2260\t near site 22, wheatgrass and composite cenosis\n23\tbare land\t\t\t\t\n24\t13:09\t38°38′46.3″\t100°23′08.5″\t2030\talfalfa land\n25\t14:39\t38°44′30.8″\t100°22′41.0″\t1660\tpoplar\n26\t9:47\t38°58′11.4″\t100°26′18.3″\t1460\trice land\n     Observation items included:\n     (1) quadrat surveys\n     (2) LAI by LAI-2000\n     (3) ground object reflectance spectra by ASD FieldSpec Pro (350-2500nm)from Gansu Meteorological Administration\n     (4) the land surface temperature and the canopy radiative temperature by the hand-held thermal infrared sensor\n     (5) the photosynthesis rate by LI-6400\n     (6) the radiative temperature by ThermaCAM SC2000\n     (7) Atmospheric parameters by CE318 to retrieve the total optical depth, aerosol optical depth, Rayleigh scattering coefficient, column water vapor in 936 nm, and various parameters at 550nm to obtain horizontal visibility with the help of MODTRAN or 6S codes\n     (8) chlorophyll consistency by portable SPAD\n     Those provide reliable ground data for developing and validating retrieval meathods of biophysical parameters from EO-1 Hyperion images.",
