            "description": "Hourly spatially complete land surface temperature (LST) products have a wide range of applications in many fields such as freeze-thaw state monitoring and summer high temperature heat wave monitoring. Although the LST retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing observations has high accuracy, it is spatially incomplete due to the influence of cloud, which heavily limits the application of LST. LST simulated by land surface models (LSM) is with high temporal resolution and spatiotemporal continuity, while the spatial resolution is relatively coarse and the accuracy is poor. Therefore, fusing the remote sensing retrieved LST and the model simulated LST is an effective way to obtain seamless hourly LST. The authors proposed a fusion method to generate 0.02° hourly seamless LST over East Asia and produced the corresponding data set.\nThis dataset is the 0.02 ° hourly seamless LST dataset over East Asia (2016-2021). Firstly, the iTES algorithm is employed to retrieve the Himawari-8/AHI LST. Secondly, the CLDAS LST is corrected to eliminate its system deviation. Finally, the multi-scale Kalman filter is employed to fuse Himawari-8/AHI LST and the bias-corrected CLDAS LST to generate 0.02 ° hourly seamless LST. The in situ verification results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the seamless LST is about 3k.\nThe temporal resolution and spatial resolution of this dataset are 1 hour and 0.02°, respectively. The time period is 2016-2021 over (0-60°N, 80°E-140°E).",

                "Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter controlling the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the surface in land surface processes and has been widely used in various disciplines, such as climate change, evapotranspiration, agriculture, hydrology, and urban climate studies. Typically, LST is obtained from ground measurements, satellite remote sensing, and land surface modeling. Thermal-infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an effective tool for obtaining LST at a large scale. TIR observations from polar-orbiting satellites, such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat series, and geostationary satellites, such as Fengyun-4A, Himawari-8, and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) have already been explored to generate LST products. Specifically, polar-orbiting satellites provide TIR observations with relatively fine spatial resolution and coarse temporal resolution, which hinders the application of LST in numerous fields, such as soil freeze/thaw status discrimination, diurnal variation in Earth-atmosphere system parameters modeling, and land surface hydrological process simulation. Geostationary satellites can achieve a temporal resolution up to 2.5 min, which can compensate for the deficiencies in the temporal continuity of polar-orbiting satellites. However, the TIR observations of both polar-orbiting satellites and geostationary satellites are spatially incomplete because TIR signals cannot penetrate clouds and obtain LST information underneath clouds. Microwave (MW) remote sensing can obtain cloudy sky LST. Unfortunately, both the accuracy and spatial resolution of MW LST under clear-sky conditions are inferior to TIR LST thus far. Recently, a large number of methods for estimating cloudy-sky LST have been proposed and significant progress has been achieved. These methods can be roughly categorized as spatial interpolation methods, surface energy balance (SEB) methods, machine learning methods, and spatiotemporal data fusion methods."

Therefore, this method cannot be fully duplicated to AHI/Himawari-8."

The bias and RMSE of the fused LST at the coarse scale (0.06°) are −0.46 K and 3.11 K, respectively. This accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of all-weather LST derived by various methods reported in the published literature. In addition, we obtained the consistent LST images across different scales. The seamless finer LST data over East Asia can not only reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of LST during different seasons, but also exactly present the diurnal variation of the LST."
