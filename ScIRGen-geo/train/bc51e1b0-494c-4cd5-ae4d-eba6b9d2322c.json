            "description": "Quantifying terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture dynamics accurately is vital for a comprehensive understanding of the global water cycle and surface energy balance.This is a novel, long-term dataset of global land ET and soil moisture obtained from the newly developed Simple Terrestrial Hydrosphere model version 2 (SiTHv2). This ecohydrological model is driven by multi-source satellite observations and hydrometeorological variables from reanalysis data, offering daily ET-related estimates (e.g., total ET, plant transpiration, soil evaporation, intercepted evaporation) and soil moisture dynamics at a 0.1° spatial resolution. Validation with in-situ measurements and comparisons with other mainstream products demonstrate the SiTHv2-derived dataset has strong performance in both magnitude and temporal dynamics of ET and soil moisture at different scales. The comprehensive water path characterization in the SiTHv2 model renders this seamless dataset particularly useful for studies requiring synchronized water budget and vegetation response to water constraints. The satellite-based SiTHv2 dataset, featuring long-term and high spatiotemporal resolution, will be sustained to support analyses related to the global water cycle, drought assessment, and ecosystem health.",
            "instructions": "Files with different temporal resolutions are organized in separate directories at TPDC. Filenames follow the structure “SiTH.v2.<VV>.<XXXX>.<YYYY>.nc”, where “VV” represents the variable name (e.g., ET -- Evapotranspiration), “XXXX” indicates the temporal resolution (e.g., Daily, Monthly, Annual), and “YYYY” denotes the four-digit year.",

                    "Answer": "An example of a data collection method for measuring global land evapotranspiration and multi-layer soil moisture is the use of satellite remote sensing combined with ground-based weather station data. This approach often involves integrating satellite observations with climate models to derive estimates of evapotranspiration and soil moisture at different depths. These datasets typically cover large temporal and spatial scales, allowing researchers to analyze trends and variability in land surface processes over the decades from 1982 to 2020.",
