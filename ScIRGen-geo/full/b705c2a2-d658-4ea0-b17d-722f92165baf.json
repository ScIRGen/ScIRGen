            "description": "This dataset includes 3 tree-ring width sequences and 1 tree-ring chronology in Kaiken River Basin, Xinjiang. Based on tree-ring cores collected from three sampling\nsites in Kaiken River basin near Tien Shan, a regional tree-ring width chronology were developed. The correlation analysis showed that the runoff of Kaiken River from previous August to current June was significantly correlated with the regional chronology, and the high correlation coefficient was 0.661 (p < 0.01). Based on the regional chronology, the August-June runoff of Kaiken River has been reconstructed over the past 422 year, and it accounted for 43.7% of actual runoff variance during\nthe common period 1983–2013. The reconstruction model is reliable, and the trend of observed and reconstructed data is relatively consistent. The results of multi-taper spectral analysis for the runoff reconstruction indicated some remarkable cycles for the past 422 years; the 11.5-year cycles correspond to the solar cycle and is found widely in runoff reconstructions in Central Asia. This may imply a solar influence on the hydroclimate variations of Tien Shan. The runoff reconstruction of Kaiken River compares well with runoff reconstructions the Urumqi River and Manas River, and implies that there is a common driving factor for the runoff in central Tien Shan, China.

                "Economic development, as well as urbanization and the increasing population, raises doubts over the supply of water resources to meet the growing needs of society in semiarid and arid areas around the world. However, instrumental hydrological records over Central Asia are short and sparse in spatial distribution, especially in Tien Shan, China. High-resolution hydrology proxy records, such as history records and tree rings, are needed to interpret the Central Asian hydrological changes. The Kaiken River basin is located in the northern slope of Tien Shan, Central Asia. During the historical period, the Kaiken River is always the most important water source for irrigation for the Qitai Oasis agriculture, and until 2004, the irrigation water still accounted for more than 97.6% of the utilization of water resources, which affected agricultural and animal husbandry production in Qitai. At the same time, the Kaiken River and the neighboring Manas and Urumqi rivers are the main sources of fresh water for the Central Asian largest urban agglomeration, included Shihezi and Urumqi. Tree rings are playing an increasingly vital role in revealing past climatic and environmental change. Nevertheless, runoff reconstructions are still insufficient in the vast areas of Central Asia for interpreting the recent hydrological variability in a long-term perspective."

                    "Answer": "Tree-ring samples are collected from three different sites in central Tien Shan. Two cores per tree are obtained from relatively old spruce trees at breast height. After drying, mounting on wooden holders, and polishing with sandpaper, annual ring widths of all cores are measured using a manual Henson micrometer with 0.01 mm precision. Cross-dating of tree-ring series is checked with the COFECHA program, and the regional tree-ring width chronology is developed using ARSTAN software. Individual ring-width series are detrended by fitting a negative exponential curve.",

                    "Answer": "Tree-ring based runoff reconstructions from different rivers in the Tien Shan region might show similar patterns or driving factors because the runoff reconstruction of the Kaiken River compares well with the Urumqi and Manas rivers. This implies that there is a common driving factor for runoff in central Tien Shan, which could be influenced by solar cycles as indicated by the presence of an 11.5-year cycle found widely in the region's runoff reconstructions.",
