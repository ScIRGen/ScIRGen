Zircon Sims zircon U-Pb dating was performed on the cameca ims-1280 secondary ion mass spectrometer, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. For zircon U-Pb dating, the instrument uses O2 - as the primary ion beam, focusing 20-30 in Gaussian mode or parallel light mode μ The ZrO +, UO2 +, uo +, U +, Pb +, and tho + ions in the samples were extracted by bombarding the surface of the solid samples with the beam spot of m diameter. In U-Pb isotopic dating, zircon reference sample Qinghu was used as internal standard and plese as external standard for isotope fractionation correction. Isoplot software was used to draw age concordance chart. The data have been published in international SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable.",

                    "Answer": "SIMS zircon U-Pb dating is a data collection method used in geological research to determine the age of zircon crystals. It involves using a Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrument, such as the CAMECA IMS-1280, to analyze isotopic compositions. The method employs O2- as a primary ion beam to focus on and bombard a solid sample surface with a Gaussian or parallel light mode, extracting ions like ZrO+, UO2+, UO+, U+, Pb+, and THO+. Zircon standards such as Qinghu are used for internal calibration and Plese for external calibration to correct for isotopic fractionation, with data being processed using software like Isoplot to create concordia diagrams for age determination.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using SIMS zircon U-Pb dating involve the use of a secondary ion mass spectrometer, specifically the CAMECA IMS-1280, which utilizes O2- as a primary ion beam to bombard the sample surface. This method focuses on zircon samples with a 20-30μm diameter beam spot, extracting ions like ZrO+, UO2+, UO+, U+, Pb+, and THO+. In terms of precision and data quality, SIMS offers high spatial resolution and is effective for analyzing small sample areas, providing detailed isotopic information. It uses Qinghu zircon as an internal standard and Plese as an external standard for isotopic fractionation correction, ensuring reliable data. Comparatively, other zircon dating methods, such as LA-ICP-MS, may offer faster data collection and require less sample preparation but might not achieve the same spatial resolution or precision as SIMS. Additionally, data processing with software like Isoplot enhances the accuracy of age concordia plots in SIMS methods, which might differ from processing workflows in other techniques.",
