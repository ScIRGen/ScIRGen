            "description": "The data are the railway density of countries along the \"the Belt and Road\" in 2010. It is the total length of actual railway operation divided by national area in each country in that year, and it is also an important index to measure a country's transportation capacity. The data come from the world bank and their length unit is kilometers per million square kilometers. These data can directly reflect the transportation capacity of countries along the \"the Belt and Road\" route, and can also reflect the economic development status and development demand of each country from the side. These data set play an important reference role in the common development of China and countries along the \"the Belt and Road\". Driven by the railway economy, China is closely linked with other countries today and we can do nothing without railway transport, so the railway data are crucial.",
            "descriptionCn": "数据为“一带一路”沿线国家2010年铁路线长度密度资料。它是每个国家当年实际铁路运营的总长度除以该国面积的结果，同时也是衡量一个国家交通运输能力的重要指标。数据来源于世界银行，铁路密度单位为每百万平方公里铁路公里。该数据可以直接地反映出“一带一路”沿线国家的交通运输能力，也能在侧面映射出各个国家的经济发展状况，发展需求。该数据集在中国同“一带一路”沿线各国家的共同发展中起到了一个重要的参考作用。由铁路带动经济，在中国同各国密切联系的今天，离不开铁路的运输，而铁路数据就显得至关重要。",
