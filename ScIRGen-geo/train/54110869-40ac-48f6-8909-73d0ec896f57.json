            "description": "Hanging coffin burial is a kind of burial custom in which the coffin is placed on the cliff, cave and crevice. Hanging coffin burials are widely distributed in the Yangtze River Valley and the south of China, as well as in Southeast Asia and even the Pacific Islands. With the natural weathering and man-made destruction, there are fewer and fewer such relics. As a kind of peculiar and ancient archaeological cultural remains and funeral custom, hanging coffin culture has been widely concerned by archaeologists.\nDating method: the wood samples on the hanging coffin were sent to beta analytical testing laboratory in Miami, USA for C14 determination. Methods: 4 in house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers (AMS) and 4 thermo IRMSS under strict chain of custom and quality control using ISO / IEC 17025:2005 testing accreditation pjla accreditation protocols\nResults: the dating results show that the earliest hanging coffin burial site is located in Wuyishan area of Fujian Province, 3600 years ago, which is equivalent to the Shang and Zhou dynasties in China. Wuyishan area in Fujian Province is considered to be the birthplace of the hanging coffin burial custom, which later spread to other areas in South China, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Located in the Jinsha River Valley of South Sichuan and Northeast Yunnan, the hanging coffin burial is the latest cultural remains of hanging coffin burial in mainland China (late Ming Dynasty), and also the West pole of the distribution of hanging coffin burial sites in China. There is a hanging coffin group in the mountainous area of Northwest Thailand, 2100-1200 years ago.",

                    "Answer": "C14测定 refers to the process of radiocarbon dating, which is a method used to determine the age of an archaeological sample by measuring the amount of carbon-14 it contains. In the context of the data collection methods mentioned, it involves sending wood samples from hanging coffin sites to a laboratory for analysis using accelerator mass spectrometers and infrared mass spectrometers, ensuring strict quality control and adherence to accreditation protocols.",

                    "Answer": "The radiocarbon dating results indicate that the earliest suspended coffin burial sites are located in the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian Province, dating back 3,600 years to the Shang and Zhou periods of China. This suggests that Fujian's Wuyi Mountains could be the origin of the suspended coffin burial customs, which later spread to other parts of southern China, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific islands. The latest dated sites, from the late Ming Dynasty, are found in the Jinsha River basin in southern Sichuan and northeastern Yunnan, marking the westernmost distribution in mainland China. Additionally, a group of suspended coffin burials in high-altitude regions in northwestern Thailand dates back 2,100-1,200 years, indicating a wide geographical spread and variation in the practice over time.",

                    "Answer": "The factors contributing to the challenges of accurately dating human bone remains in hanging coffin burial using C14 measurement include the natural weathering and human destruction of these sites, which can limit the availability and condition of samples. Additionally, the precision of dating can be affected by the preservation state of the wooden samples used for C14 analysis, and the requirement for strict chain of custody and quality control protocols to ensure accurate results.",

                    "Answer": "Using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) for carbon dating provides precise age estimations, which is crucial for archaeological sites like悬棺葬 where samples might be scarce or deteriorated due to natural weathering and human destruction. The impact of using AMS includes improved accuracy and reliability of dating results, which helps in understanding the chronological development and spread of the悬棺葬 tradition. However, challenges may still arise from the quality and preservation state of samples, which can affect the results.",

By dating these sites, researchers aim to understand the historical timeline, establish connections with other regions, and analyze the evolution of this burial custom, contributing to broader archaeological and cultural insights.",

The laboratory utilizes 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers (AMS) and 4 Thermo IRMSs, operating under strict chain of custody and quality control protocols according to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation PJLA #59423. This ensures accuracy and reliability in the dating results, contributing to understanding the chronological framework of the hanging coffin burial sites.",
