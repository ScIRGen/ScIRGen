Especially for surface solar radiation (SSR), the earliest studies can date back to the 60s of the last century (Fritz, Rao, & Weinstein, 1964). Besides large and continuous spatio-temporal coverage, another main advantage of the satellite remote sensing technique over other approaches (e.g., discrete surface observation or reanalysis modelled products) is that it can accurately capture the spatial distributions and dynamic changes of cloud, which is regarded as a superior modulator of SSR (Forman & Margulis, 2009). Up to now, over decades of rapid development, estimation of SSR based on satellite remote sensing technique has become increasingly mature, and many products have already been produced (Liang, Wang, Zhang, & Wild, 2010; Pinker & Laszlo, 1992; Pinker et al., 2003; Posselt, Mueller, Stockli, & Trentmann, 2012; Zhang, Liang, Zhou, Wu, & Zhao, 2014; Zhang, Rossow, Lacis, Oinas, & Mishchenko, 2004)."

The current study demonstrates that wildly fluctuating representativeness errors exist which are strongly contingent on the time and space scales of remote sensing products, as well as instant atmospheric conditions. The errors caused by the poor representativeness of surface sites, likely significantly contribute to the large differences between measurements and products."

                "In this study, the MSD is the variance of representativeness error in time-space domain, which measures the overall variability of representativeness error. During the matrix experiment, all measurements were carried out carefully with continuous supervision. Spirit levels and glass domes of the 17 radiometers were checked weekly to guard against any perceptible instrument tilting and possible soiling of the sensors. A thermal offset correction, a calibration correction, a leveling correction and a correction on soiling error were initially devised to perform in order. The recording cycle of raw SSR was 10 min, and data gaps nearly did not exist during the experiment. The corrected data at the 16 sites would be utilized for the following analyses. Representativeness error of point-scale measurements with respect to grid-level surrounding include two levels of errors, namely detailed error from point to kilometer scales and macroscopic error from kilometer to grid scales."

On timescales longer than or equal to one day, representativeness errors do not need to be considered for validations of kilometer-level products, but on shorter timescales representativeness errors will affect the validation results to some extent. For instantaneous products with 5 km resolution, our study indicates over 13% of errors can be attributed to the inherent representativeness error, and 30-minute surface measurements are recommended for a routine validation. However, for validations of grid-level products, representativeness errors basically cannot be neglected regardless of timescales."
