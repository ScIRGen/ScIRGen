            "description": "This data includes Re Os isotopic data of molybdenite, zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, trace element geochemistry and Hf isotopic data of intrusive rocks, and major and trace geochemical and Sr Nd isotopic data of whole rock. The samples were collected from sangbugala skarn Cu Au deposit in Zedang area, Gangdise belt, southern Tibet, and Kru skarn Cu Au deposit in Shannan area. The lithology includes diorite and biotite granodiorite. The U-Pb geochronology, trace element geochemistry and Hf isotope data of zircons were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Re Os isotopic data of molybdenite and Sr Nd isotopic data of rocks were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Based on the data obtained, it is determined that the Mesozoic large-scale magmatic activities in Gangdise belt also formed Cu Au deposits, and the differences of oxygen fugacity and source area between ore-forming magma and non ore-forming magma are clear.",

                    "Answer": "Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a technique used to analyze the isotopic composition and trace element geochemistry of zircon samples in geological data collection. It involves using a laser to ablate a small portion of the sample, which is then ionized in an inductively coupled plasma and analyzed using a mass spectrometer. This method provides precise measurements of U-Pb isotopic dating, trace elements, and Hf isotopic data.",

                    "Answer": "Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is used for obtaining zircon U-Pb isotopic data, which is effective for precise age determination and geochemical analysis of trace elements. This method is particularly useful for understanding the timing and duration of geological events. On the other hand, multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) is used for molybdenite Re-Os isotopic measurements, which provides high precision in dating mineralization processes through the Re-Os decay system. The differences between these methods lie in the isotopic systems they target and the specific geological questions they address, with LA-ICP-MS being more versatile in geochronology and geochemistry, while MC-ICP-MS offers more precise isotopic dating for direct mineralization events.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of isotopic analysis techniques, such as U-Pb zircon dating, Re-Os molybdenite isotopic measurement, and Sr-Nd isotope analysis, is influenced by the need to accurately determine the age, source, and oxidation conditions of the magmas. These techniques help identify the contrasting characteristics between ore-forming and non-ore-forming magmas, such as differences in oxygen fugacity and source region.",

                    "Answer": "Using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) allows for precise in-situ analysis of zircon U-Pb isotopes and trace elements, providing detailed geochemical data. This can lead to more accurate dating and characterization of geological events compared to traditional methods, which may lack the resolution and specificity offered by LA-ICP-MS. The detailed geochemical and isotopic data help in distinguishing between ore-forming and non-ore-forming magmas based on differences in oxygen fugacity and source characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "To analyze and interpret isotopic and geochemical data from Cu-Au mineral deposits in the Gangdese Belt, the procedural steps include: collecting samples of skarn-type Cu-Au deposits, including diorite and biotite granodiorite, from locations like the Zedang and Kelu areas; using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to obtain zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, trace element geochemistry, and Hf isotopic data; employing X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for whole-rock major and trace element geochemical data; analyzing molybdenite Re-Os isotopic data and rock Sr-Nd isotopic data through multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; and finally, interpreting the data to understand the large-scale Cretaceous magmatic activity in the Gangdese Belt and its role in forming Cu-Au mineral deposits, while identifying differences in oxygen fugacity and source regions between mineralizing and non-mineralizing magmas.",
