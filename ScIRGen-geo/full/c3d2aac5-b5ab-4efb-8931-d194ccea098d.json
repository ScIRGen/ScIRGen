                    "Answer": "Using high-resolution spatial datasets derived from Anusplin interpolation likely enhances the accuracy of simulating spatiotemporal patterns of ecosystem services like ecosystem production, carbon fixation, hydrological regulation, and soil retention. A higher spatial resolution can provide more detailed insights into the variations across the landscape, potentially leading to more precise modeling of changes in ecosystem services over time and space.",
