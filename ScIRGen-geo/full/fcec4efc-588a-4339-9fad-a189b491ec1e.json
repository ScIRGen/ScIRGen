The data sheet includes Lake core sample number, laboratory sample number, sample depth, 14C results, dating error and corrected results. The chronological framework of Lake cores is the basis for paleoclimate reconstruction. 2) All 14C data are completed in beta analytical Inc, and the laboratory operation is in strict accordance with the standard process. 3) The quality of the 40 dating data is good. 4) The data have been published, which provides basic data for the study of paleoclimate in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The use of radiocarbon (14C) dating is essential in constructing the age framework for lake sediment cores because it provides a reliable method to determine the age of organic materials within the sediments. This is crucial for paleoclimate reconstruction, as it allows researchers to establish a chronological timeline of sediment deposition, which is foundational for interpreting past climate changes. The precision and accuracy of 14C dating help ensure that the sediment core data accurately reflect historical climate conditions. Additionally, the data's quality and the rigorous standards followed in the laboratory processes, as carried out by testing centers like Beta analytic inc, contribute to the reliability of the results.",

These samples undergo radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the sediments using 14C isotope analysis. The dating is performed in a controlled laboratory setting following standardized procedures. The results include raw 14C dating results, measurement errors, and corrected age results, providing a chronological framework essential for paleoenvironmental reconstruction.",
