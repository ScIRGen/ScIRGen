                "In mountainous areas, different altitudes exhibit distinct vertical zonation due to variations in water (precipitation) and heat (temperature) components. The Sejila Mountain in southeastern Tibet has a pronounced mountain vertical zonation feature: from the foot of the mountain to the summit, the vegetation types include broadleaf forest, mixed coniferous and broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, shrubs, and moss. The vegetation types in Sejila Mountain are rich, and the longevity of trees is notable (Lu et al., 2015). The tree line at 4390 m is one of the highest forest tree lines in the world, making it a hotspot for tree-ring and forest ecology research (Wang et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018). Currently, there is limited research on the vertical gradients of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain (Liang et al., 2011). Most studies by some scholars on the changes in temperature and precipitation vertical gradients in this region and its vicinity are based on the Baji Station (formerly Linzhi Station) and the nearby Bomi Station, focusing on the vertical temperature lapse rate across the entire Tibetan Plateau (Jiang Jingchao et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2001, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) and precipitation gradients (Guo et al., 2016)."

This not only deepens the understanding of the influence of slope orientation on the vertical gradient changes of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain but also helps to better understand the physiological and ecological characteristics of plant and animal distribution with altitude changes. Additionally, it provides reliable data support for future hydrological simulations in this region."

Based on the geographical locations of these stations, the stations in the Sejila Mountain area are divided into two natural geographical units according to their slope orientation: the western slope (south slope) and the eastern slope (north slope), with the Sejila Mountain Pass station belonging to both the western and eastern slopes.
