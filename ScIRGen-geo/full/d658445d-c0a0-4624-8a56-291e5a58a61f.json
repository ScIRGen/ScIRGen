            "description": "This data set is the oxygen isotope data ( δ 18O) and its temperature reconstruction from the Chongce ice cores, in western Kunlun Mountains, Northwestern Tibetan Plateau. The Chongce ice cores were dated back to 7 ka BP by a two-parameter flow model (2p model) constrained by the AMS 14C ages. The  δ 18O measurements were performed at Nanjing University by a Wavelength Scanned Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (WS-CRDS, model: Picarro L2120-i), with the analytical uncertainty of less than 0.1‰. Our reconstructed temperature record shows a long-term warming trend until ~2 ka BP,  followed by an abrupt change to a relatively cool period until the start of the industrial-era warming. In addition, the record shows that temperatures during the recent decades are almost the highest during the past 7 ka BP, highlighting the unusual warming forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases.",

This ratio is used as a proxy to infer past temperatures and climate conditions. The Chongce ice core data set includes δ18O measurements performed using a Wavelength Scanned Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer, with an analytical uncertainty of less than 0.1‰, to reconstruct temperature records over the past 7000 years.",

                    "Answer": "The oxygen isotope measurements from the Chongce ice cores using a Wavelength Scanned Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (WS-CRDS) offer high analytical uncertainty of less than 0.1‰, which may provide more precise isotope data compared to traditional methods. This method allows for a detailed reconstruction of temperature records over the past 7000 years, capturing long-term warming trends and abrupt changes in temperature. Other data collection methods might vary in precision, temporal resolution, and sensitivity to environmental conditions, potentially affecting the accuracy and detail of the temperature reconstruction.",

This method helps establish a more robust chronological framework, which is crucial for understanding long-term climate trends and variations, such as the warming and cooling phases identified over the past 7,000 years in the dataset.",
