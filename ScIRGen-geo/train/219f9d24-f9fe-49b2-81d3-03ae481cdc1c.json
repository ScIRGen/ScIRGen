Observation items included (1) physical quantities by direct observations: resonant frequency, the rate of attenuation and 3db bandwidth; (2) physical quantities by indirect observations: snow density, snow complex permittivity (the real part and the imaginary part), snow volumetric moisture and snow gravimetric moisture. 13 files are archived, and the user guide of the sampling plot and observation background is included too.",

Rather than using field measurements, remote sensing (RS) is now more widely used in modelling snow because of its unique advantages in obtaining large-scale ground information (Seidel and Martinec, 2004). The snow cover area (SCA) can be observed with higher spatial resolution at near-infrared and visible wavelengths (Hall and Riggs, 2006). The spatial and temporal variations in the snow are fundamentally driven by the energy and mass balance. However, the main disadvantage of the MODIS sensor is that it is unable to record observations in cloud-covered regions (Gafurov and Bardossy, 2009)."

As described above, spatial and temporal SWE distribution can be retrieved effectively using MODIS data and the energy balance method. The simulation results indicate that almost half of MODIS image waste could have been avoided in the Binggou watershed in the snow season of 2008. The results indicate that in the alpine region without abundant ground gauges, it is practical and relatively accurate to simulate spatial and temporal snow distribution using snowcover information from RS data and observations from several local weather stations."
