            "description": "The data are the main and trace data of whole rock, zircon trace and U-Pb dating data, and multi-metal element data of borehole samples of podaoling porphyry granodiorite porphyry, quartz syenite and granite in Guichi area, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Eastern China. The data of major elements were obtained by XRF analysis, trace elements by ICP-MS analysis, zircon U-Pb dating by LA-ICP-MS analysis, trace Au by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, as, Sb, Bi by atomic fluorescence spectrometry, other metal elements by atomic absorption spectrometry and ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the obtained data, the geological characteristics of the deposit can be summarized in detail. Combined with the comprehensive study of chronology and geochemistry of magmatic rocks in the area, the deposit types can be discussed, and the genesis of magmatic rocks related to gold and copper gold deposits can be clarified. The regional magmatic metallogenic model in baodaoling area is established.",
