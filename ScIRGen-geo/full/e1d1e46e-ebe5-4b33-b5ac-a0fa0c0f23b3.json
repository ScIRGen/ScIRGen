            "description": "This data is the data of major and trace elements and fluid inclusions of scheelite bearing granodiorite porphyry in southern Anhui Province. The data of major elements in the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the data of trace elements were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the temperature of fluid inclusions was measured by Linkam thmsg 600 cold and hot station. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the data obtained, petrological and cathodoluminescence (CL) observation, major and trace element analysis and fluid inclusion study were carried out for Dongyuan and zhuxiling deposits, and the contribution of magmatism, metasomatism and alteration to W content was discussed. The mineralized and non mineralized rocks in the granodiorite porphyry are collected and compared. The movement and metallogenic mechanism of W and its geological significance are discussed.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of geochemical studies of granite porphyry, XRF and ICP-MS are used to obtain data on major and trace elements, respectively. XRF is typically employed for major element analysis due to its ability to handle bulk samples and provide rapid results, making it suitable for high-throughput analysis. However, it may be less sensitive for detecting trace elements compared to ICP-MS. ICP-MS, on the other hand, is highly sensitive and capable of detecting trace elements at much lower concentrations, providing detailed compositional information crucial for understanding trace element distribution. Both methods are complementary, with XRF providing a broad overview and ICP-MS offering detailed insights into trace elements, which is important for understanding the geochemical characteristics and mineralization processes in granite porphyry.",

                    "Answer": "The geochemical patterns observed in a dataset of granodiorite porphyry can reveal insights into magmatic processes through the analysis of main and trace elements obtained via XRF and ICP-MS. These analyses, along with fluid inclusion studies, can indicate how magmatic differentiation, alteration, and metasomatism contribute to tungsten content. By comparing mineralized and non-mineralized rocks, researchers can infer the movement and mineralization mechanisms of tungsten and their geological significance.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing XRF and ICP-MS analysis for collecting geochemical data on granodiorite porphyry allows for detailed characterization of both major and trace elements, helping to elucidate the roles of magmatic processes, metasomatism, and alteration in contributing to tungsten content. This comprehensive data aids in comparing mineralized and non-mineralized rocks, which can reveal insights into the movement and deposition mechanisms of tungsten and their geological significance.",
