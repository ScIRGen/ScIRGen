            "description": "Daily and Monthly evapotranspiration (5km x 5km spatial resolution) for global land area was derived from satellite data and a surface energy balance method (EB). The global 5 km daily and monthly ET dataset is produced with the revised SEBS algorithm in Chen et al. 2019 JGR and Chen et al. 2013 (JAMC). For how to obtain seamless daily evaporation data by thermal infrared, please refer to Chen et al. 2021 JGR. This paper also compares different evaporation products. The results show that this product is significantly better than Landflux, GLEAM, MOD16, GLDAS and ERA-Interim products in irrigation area. The downscaling of reanalysis forcing data is detailed in this paper. MODIS LST, NDVI, Global forest height, GlobAlbedo, GLASS LAI have been used in this ET calculation. The ET dataset will be updated to near-present with the availability of input dataset. The global 5 km sensible heat flux, net radiation, latent heat flux will be open with the email contact with Dr. Xuelong Chen. \n\nDaily ET File name: 20001201-ET-V1.mat, 2000-year, 12-month,01-day, ET-Evapotranspiration, V1-version 1;unit: mm/day (unit8 need transfer to single or double and should be divided by 10);data type: unit8 was used to save the disk space, 255 is used for ocean and water body pixels.\nMonthly ET File name: ETm200012-ET-V1.mat, 2000-year, 12-month, ET-Evapotranspiration, V1-version 1;unit: mm/month (int16 need transfer to single or double and should be divided by 10);data type: int16 was used to save the disk space, 0 is used for ocean and water body pixels.\n\nThe daily ET dataset is produced with a similar method and satellite data as in Chen, X., et al., 2014: Development of a 10 year (2001–2010) 0.1° dataset of land-surface energy balance for mainland China, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 13097–13117, doi:10.5194/acp-14-13097-2014. The calculation of roughness length and kB_1 for global land were updated by the method in Chen, X., et al, 2019, A Column Canopy‐Air Turbulent Diffusion Method for Different Canopy Structures, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 2019.01.15, 124. Most of the satellite input data were from MODIS. Meteorological data was from ERA-Interim. Global canopy height information was derived from GLAS and MODIS NDVI. \n\nThe daily ET has a mean bias (MB) of 0.04 mm/day, RMSE is 1.56 (±0.25) mm/day.",

                "Because of the elevation of the Tibetan Plateau, energy and water are exchanged between the surface and the middle troposphere above it. The growing interest in the interaction between atmosphere and plateau surface is driven by the realization that the thermal effects of the plateau may influence atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (Tao and Ding 1981; Wang et al. 2011). Conventional meteorological techniques that employ point measurements to estimate the components of the surface energy balance represent work on a local scale (Su et al. 2006). Remote sensing enables us to estimate surface fluxes from local to regional scales and offers the possibility to derive the regional distribution of land surface heat fluxes over little-instrumented and sparsely populated areas. Recent studies have explored remote sensing approaches to estimate the regional distribution of surface heat fluxes (Ma et al. 2003, 2008b, 2011). The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) developed by Su (2002) can estimate turbulent heat fluxes from point to continental scale with reasonable accuracy using satellite and meteorological data (Su et al. 2005; Oku et al. 2007, etc.). The roughness height for heat transfer z0h needs to be determined to accurately calculate the sensible heat flux by means of the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) and SEBS. The scalar roughness height for heat transfer can be derived from z0h = z0m/exp(kB21), where z0m is the roughness height for momentum transfer and kB21 is the excess resistance for heat transportation, with k again being the von Kármán constant and B21 being the Stanton number. SEBS has been widely used to estimate the surface energy balance and evapotranspiration in different areas; further analysis of the uncertainties has been limited, however."

In this study, we first tested at four different land cover units whether SEBS driven by boundary layer meteorological measurements, as opposed to tower-based flux measurements, can be used to derive items of surface energy balance over the Tibetan Plateau. Then, we evaluated the impact of varying parameters on H estimates from SEBS and used this information to try to identify the causes of SEBS’s biases. We then improved the turbulent heat parameterization in SEBS—to be specific, the equation for kB21."

                "The lack of observational datasets on the interactions between the whole plateau and the atmosphere above makes it difficult for us to quantitatively analyze the variation in energy and water exchanges in this region. Although significant progress has been made, further efforts are needed to improve the accuracy of SEBS over the Tibetan Plateau regions (Su et al. 2006). Few formulas are able to describe the observed diurnal variation in kB21 over the Tibetan Plateau (Ma et al. 2009). The sensitivity of sensible heat flux estimates from SEBS has not yet been fully examined."

The TK2 software package (Mauder and Foken 2011) was used here to process the turbulent data of QOMS/CAS, Nam Co, and Linzhi. The spike-detection algorithm of Vickers and Mahrt (1997) was used to remove physically or electronically unfeasible values in the high-frequency turbulent data. The time delay between sonic-anemometer (CSAT3) and gas-analyzer (LI-7500) signals was eliminated by maximizing covariance. Tilt correction was done with the planar-fit method (Wilczak et al. 2001). Correction of spectral loss was done according to the Moore (1986) method. The sonic temperature was converted into actual temperature. The Webb–Pearman–Leuning (WPL) corrections (Webb et al. 1980) were also performed in the process. The SEBS model was run to produce accurate sensible heat flux results, which was achieved by using available observational variables."
