            "description": "This data is the in-situ analysis data of trace elements, strontium isotopes and sulfide S-Pb isotopes of Scheelite from shiweidong tungsten copper deposit in Dahutang giant ore field. In situ trace elements of scheelite were analyzed by la-icp-ms. in situ Sr and S-Pb isotopes of sulfide were analyzed by la-mc-icp-ms. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the obtained data and the geochemical data of other tungsten deposits in Dahutang ore field, a new understanding of the origin, hydrothermal mineralization, fluid evolution history and genesis of the shiweidong tungsten deposit is provided.",

                    "Answer": "In situ analysis refers to the technique of analyzing minerals directly at the sampling site without needing to extract and process them extensively. In the context of geochemical data collection for mineral deposits, it involves using methods such as LA-ICP-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS to obtain microelement and isotope data directly from mineral samples like scheelite, providing insights into the source, hydrothermal processes, fluid evolution history, and genesis of the mineral deposits.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of specific isotopic analysis techniques like LA-ICP-MS and LA-MC-ICP-MS in the geochemical study of tungsten-copper deposits is influenced by the need for precise and accurate in-situ analysis of trace elements and isotopes. These methods enable researchers to obtain detailed data on micro-scale variations within minerals, which is crucial for understanding the geological history and fluid evolution processes of the mineral deposits.",

                    "Answer": "The in-situ geochemical data, including trace elements, strontium isotopes, and sulfide S-Pb isotopes, provide crucial insights into the source, hydrothermal mineralization processes, fluid evolution history, and genesis of the tungsten-copper deposits. These data help in developing a comprehensive understanding of the mineralization processes, thereby contributing to the broader knowledge of geological and geochemical phenomena in the Dahutang giant ore field.",

These methods yield reliable data that help explore the origin, hydrothermal mineralization, fluid evolution history, and genesis of the ore deposit.",
