            "description": "Zircon, rses reference sample sl13 and TEM were placed in epoxy resin target, then polished, cleaned and gilded (Xu et al., 2007). The internal structure of zircon was studied by reflected light, transmitted light and cathodoluminescence (CL), and the suitable testing position was marked on the zircon before testing (Fig. 5). Zircon U-Pb composition analysis was performed on shrimp Ⅱ of Beijing ion probe center. The reference zircon TEM (417 MA) was used for isotope fractionation correction (black et al., 2003A), and sl13 (572 Ma, u content: 238 MA) was used × The contents of u, th and Pb in zircons were calibrated (black et al., 2003b). In order to ensure the accuracy of the analysis, the zircon to be measured and the reference zircon were cross measured by TEM. The data were processed by isoplot program of Ludwig (Ludwig, 1999, 2001). Ordinary lead is corrected according to the 204Pb content measured in the test. The data will be available in 2020. Since the age of diabase dikes is Mesozoic and younger, 206Pb / 238U ratio is used for age calculation.",

                    "Answer": "Zircon U-Pb composition analysis in geochemical data collection refers to the method of determining the age and isotopic composition of zircon minerals using the U-Pb dating technique. This involves analyzing the ratios of uranium (U) to lead (Pb) isotopes within zircon crystals, which are typically done using a sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP). The process includes preparing the zircon samples by embedding them in epoxy resin, polishing, cleaning, and gold-coating them, followed by examining their internal structure through reflected and transmitted light, as well as cathodoluminescence, to identify suitable test locations. The analysis is cross-verified using reference zircons for isotopic fractionation correction and calibrated for elemental concentrations using known standards. The data is processed with software like ISOPLOT to ensure accuracy, with corrections for common lead based on measured 204Pb levels.",

                    "Answer": "Inaccuracies in zircon U-Pb dating using ion probe techniques may arise from several factors, such as the precision of the SHRIMPⅡ ion probe, the effectiveness of isotopic fractionation correction using the reference zircon TEM, the calibration of U, Th, and Pb content with SL13, and the accuracy of common lead correction based on measured 204Pb content. Additionally, factors like the selection and marking of appropriate test positions on zircon grains before analysis and the processing of data using Ludwig's ISOPLOT program can also contribute to potential inaccuracies.",

                    "Answer": "Using SHRIMPⅡ for zircon U-Pb analysis allows for high precision and accuracy in determining the geological age of rocks, such as the diabase dykes in Hainan Province. This is achieved through the isotopic fractionation correction using a reference zircon TEM and the calibration of U, Th, and Pb contents using SL13. The method ensures precise age calculations, especially useful for younger formations like those from the Mesozoic era, by focusing on the 206Pb/238U ratio.",
