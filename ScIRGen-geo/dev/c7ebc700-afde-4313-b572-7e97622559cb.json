            "description": "This dataset includes the maximum normalized vegetation index (NDVI)  data from 1982 to 2015, the maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data from 2000 to 2020, and the land cover change (LUCC) data from 2001 to 2019 in the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC). Among these, NDVI data was extracted from GIMMS satellite data with a resolution of 8 km; EVI and LUCC data were extracted from MODIS satellite data (MOD13A3 and MCD12C1) with a resolution of 1 km and 5 km, respectively. The dataset adopted a filter scheme based on the land cover types and the continuity of the remote sensing data to eliminate the outliers or missing values in the original data, which is of higher quality than the source data. Outlier and missing value are set to -3000 in EVI data set. Besides, we adopted the maximum value composite (MVC) method to process NDVI and EVI data to obtain the annual maximum NDVI and EVI, which can better reflect the vegetation distribution and change in CMREC over the past several decades. The spatio-temporal changes of vegetation and land use  extracted from satellite remote sensing data will provide scientifical guidance for the risk control and prevention of the ecological environment change in CMREC.",

Mountainous regions are sensitive to the impacts of climate change. Located in the southeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and spanning the first and the second terrain ladders of China, HMR (Hengduan Mountains Region) lies in the high gradient zone of geological conditions, climate, and vegetation, resulting in the complex disaster-prone environment with mountain disasters the most developed, active, complete, and severe. Beyond the combined influence of the East Asia Monsoon and the South Asia Monsoon, the HMR is also frequently affected by several mesoscale systems, such as the southwest vortex, plateau vortex, shear line, and mesoscale convective system. The above-diversified factors lead to the unique vertical zonality of climate and vegetation distribution in HMR."

The new scheme first constructs the regionalization index system, fully considering the extraordinarily complicated geomorphic pattern of mountains and valleys, the scarcity of meteorological observations, and the remarkable differentiation of climate and vegetation in HMR. Specifically, the stepwise downscaling pane division method is initially proposed to determine the zoning boundary, alleviating the excessive dependence of the traditional zoning method on subjective experience."
