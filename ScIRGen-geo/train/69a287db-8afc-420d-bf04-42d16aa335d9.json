            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Hydrometeorological observation network obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Huangcaogou station between 7 June, 2013, and 31 December, 2013. The site (100.731° E, 38.003° N) was located on a cold grassland surface in the Huangcaogou village, E’bao town, Qilian County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3137 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45D; 5 m, north), wind speed and direction profile (03001; 10 m, north), air pressure (CS100; in the tamper box on the ground), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), four-component radiometer (CNR1; 6 m, south), two infrared temperature sensors (IRTC3; 6 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFT3; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (AV-10T; 0, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), and soil moisture profile (ECh2o-5; -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m; RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The data of wind direction were missing during 12 June, 2013 and 24 September, 2013. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2013-9-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Li et al. (2013) (for hydrometeorological observation network or sites information), Liu et al. (2011) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for meteorological elements at a high-altitude grassland site involve specific placements and orientations of sensors, such as air temperature and humidity sensors at 5m facing north, and wind sensors at 10m, which may differ from methods in lowland agricultural areas where different environmental conditions and vegetation might require alternative sensor heights, orientations, and types.",

                    "Answer": "Data quality issues in high-altitude regions like Qinghai Province can arise due to several factors, including sensor malfunctions, harsh weather conditions affecting equipment, and environmental factors such as snow cover or ice formation impacting sensor readings. For example, wind direction sensor issues were reported between June 12 and September 24, 2013, leading to missing data. Quality control measures, such as marking doubtful data in red and removing data beyond physical limits or instrument range, are crucial to address these challenges.",

                    "Answer": "Implementing a standardized quality control process can lead to more accurate and reliable data by ensuring that data gaps are identified and marked, duplicate records are removed, and data that exceed physical or instrument limits are deleted. This can also help in maintaining consistent data format and naming conventions, which are crucial for data integrity and usability in remote high-altitude regions.",

Additionally, issues such as the malfunctioning of the wind direction sensor from June 12 to September 24, 2013, are noted, which led to data loss during that period.",
