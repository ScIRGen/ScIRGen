            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with EO-1 Hyperion was obtained in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas on May 25, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) Atmospheric parameters on the ICBC resort office roof by CE318 (produced by CIMEL in France). The total optical depth, aerosol optical depth, Rayleigh scattering coefficient, column water vapor in 936 nm, particle size spectrum and phase function were then retrieved from these observations. The optical depth in 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm and 440nm were all acquired by CE318. Those data include the raw data in k7 format and can be opened by ASTPWin. ReadMe.txt is attached for detail. Processed data (after retrieval of the raw data) in Excel format are on optical depth, rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. \n     (2) Ground object reflectance spectra f new-born rape and the bare land in Biandukou foci experimental area by ASD FieldSpec (350~2500 nm) from BNU. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro), and pre-processed data on reflectance were in Excel format.\n     (3) Soil moisture (0-40cm) by the cutting ring and the soil temperature (0-40cm) by the  thermocouple in Huazhaizi desert No. 1 plot and the windbreak forest; and soil moisture and the soil temperature (0-100cm) in Yingke oasis maize field. Data were archived in Excel format.\n     (4) LAI. The maximum leaf length and width of each alfalfa and barley were measured. Data were archived in Excel format.\n     (5) Coverage of maize and wheat in Yingke oasis maize field, of vegetation (Reaumuria soongorica) in Huazhaizi desert No. 1 and 2 plots by the self-made coverage instrument and the camera (2.5m-3.5m above the ground). Based on the length of the measuring tape and the bamboo pole, the size of the photo can be decided GPS date were also collected and the technology LAB was applied to retrieve the coverage of the green vegetation. Besides, such related information as surroundings environment was also recorded. Data included the primarily measured image and final fraction of vegetation coverage.",

                    "Answer": "The CE318 sun photometer measures atmospheric parameters by capturing direct solar radiation, allowing the derivation of optical thickness, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor content. This method involves specific wavelengths and complex data processing using software like ASTPWin. In contrast, soil moisture and temperature measurements involve direct sampling and thermocouples, with data processed in Excel. The photometer's accuracy relies on precise spectral measurements and atmospheric models, whereas soil measurements depend on physical sampling and environmental conditions. Both methods require different data processing techniques, with the photometer needing specialized software and soil measurements processed with more straightforward tools.",

                    "Answer": "The atmospheric conditions, including the presence and concentration of aerosols, can be inferred from the optical thickness and aerosol optical depth data. By measuring direct solar radiation and applying retrieval algorithms, one can determine the optical thickness of non-water vapor channels, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, and water vapor content in the atmospheric column. This information, along with horizontal visibility derived from the data, provides a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric state at the time of measurement.",

                    "Answer": "The CE318 sun photometer is used to directly measure solar radiation, which allows for the retrieval of optical thickness, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor content in the atmosphere. The procedure involves placing the CE318 on a rooftop, where it measures direct solar radiation across five bands (1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm, and 440nm). The data is stored in a proprietary *.k7 format, which can be opened with ASTPWin software. The data is then processed to calculate optical thickness, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical thickness, horizontal visibility, and near-surface atmospheric temperature. This processing also involves calculating the sun's azimuth and zenith angles, earth-sun distance correction factors, and atmospheric mass. The processed data is saved in Excel format for further analysis.",
