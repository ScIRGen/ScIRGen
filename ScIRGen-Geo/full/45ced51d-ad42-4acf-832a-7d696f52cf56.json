            "description": "In various glacial lake outburst floods, the commonly reported disaster impacts include damage to buildings, hydropower projects, farmland, roads, and bridges. We use these indicators to quantify the exposure of glacial lake outburst floods. Except for water and electricity information, all exposed structural features come from the revised and supplemented OpenStreetMap（ https://www.openstreetmap.org/ ）. OpenStreetMap has limited land cover for the entire Qinghai Tibet Plateau. We examined these structures along the simulated 1499 high risk glacial lake outburst flood paths, and found that a large number of buildings, farmland, roads and bridges had not been drawn, especially the villages located in the ravines, such as Xizang, Hindu Kush Mountains and Central Asia, where there were serious gaps. Except for Nepal, the coverage in other regions of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is optimistically estimated to be less than 5%. Therefore, we artificially supplemented the potential exposed structures of the entire Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Considering the uncertainty of the model flood zone boundary, we set a 200 meter buffer zone around the area that may be submerged by glacial lake outburst floods when extracting exposed features from high-precision Maxar Premium images. Finally, we identified a total of 520610 buildings, 1996 square kilometers of farmland, 98630 kilometers of roads, and 6035 bridges within these buffer zones. The reconstructed structural features can accurately reflect the construction level of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau from 2016 to 2020.",
            "descriptionCn": "在各种冰湖溃决洪水事件中，通常报告的灾害影响包括对建筑物、水电项目、农田、道路和桥梁的破坏。我们采用这些5项指标来量化冰湖溃决洪水影响的下游暴露度问题。除水电信息外，所有暴露结构特征来自修正补充后的 OpenStreetMap（https://www.openstreetmap.org/）。OpenStreetMap 对整个青藏高原的地物覆盖度有限。我们沿着模拟的1499个高危险冰湖溃决洪水路径检查了这些结构，结果发现大量建筑物、农田、道路和桥梁没有被绘制，尤其是位于沟壑中的村庄，例如西藏、兴都库什山脉和中亚等地区，缺漏严重。除尼泊尔的覆盖度较高外，青藏高原其他地区的覆盖度乐观估计不足 5%。因此，我们对整个青藏高原的潜在暴露结构进行了人工补充。考虑到模型洪泛区边界的不确定性，我们在从高精度 Maxar Premium 图像中提取建筑物、农田、道路和桥梁暴露要素时，在冰湖溃决洪水可能淹没的区域周围设置了 200 米的缓冲区。最后，我们识别了这些缓冲区内共 520,610 栋建筑物、1,996 平方公里农田、98,630 公里道路和 6,035 座桥梁。重建的结构特征可以准确反映 2016 年至 2020 年青藏高原的建设水平。",

The coverage is particularly low, estimated optimistically at less than 5% outside of Nepal, where coverage is higher. This necessitated manual supplementation of exposure structures across the region.",
