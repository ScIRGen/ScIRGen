            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Jingyangling station eddy covariance system (EC) in the upstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2020. The site (101.1160E, 37.8384N) was located in the Jingyangling, near Qilian County in Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3750 m. The EC was installed at a height of 4.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3B & Li7500DS) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. Due to the malfunction of instruments, data during March 7-16, May 31 to July 17, August 12-20, and September 24 to October 7 were missing.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al.

                    "Answer": "An eddy covariance system is a scientific instrument setup used to measure and analyze the exchange of gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. It typically includes devices like a sonic anemometer for wind speed and direction, and gas analyzers for measuring concentrations of specific gases. In meteorological observations, it is used to collect high-frequency data (e.g., 10Hz) and process it into averaged flux data over a set period (e.g., 30 minutes) to study surface-atmosphere interactions.",

                    "Answer": "The data quality assessment process using Eddypro software involves steps like outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic virtual temperature correction, and density correction. It also evaluates the quality of flux values based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics. Data is further screened by excluding erroneous instrument data, data around precipitation events, and high missing rates in original data. Quality markers for heat, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes are classified into nine levels, with levels 1-3 indicating good quality and level 9 indicating poor quality.",

These processes help in eliminating erroneous data points and correcting systematic errors, ensuring that the final dataset more accurately reflects the true environmental conditions. However, there is also a risk of over-correction, which might lead to loss of potentially valuable data or introduce biases if not carefully managed. The quality of the final dataset is assessed through quality ratings, which categorize the data into different levels of reliability, offering users insights into the trustworthiness of the data for further analysis.",

Additionally, quality evaluation of flux values is performed based on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data is further filtered by excluding data during instrument errors, excluding data one hour before and after precipitation, and removing 30-minute intervals with more than 10% missing data from the original 10Hz data.",
