            "description": "The dataset of LST (land surface temperature) observed by the thermal camera (ThermaCAM SC2000 and ThermaCAM S60) at 24°×18° was obtained in the Yingke oasis, Huazhaizi desert steppe and Linze grassland foci experimental areas on May 20, 24,28 and 30, Jun. 1, 4, 16 and 29, Jul. 7, 8 and 11, 2008. Meanwhile, the optical photos were acquired in Yingke oasis maize field, Huazhaizi desert No. 1 and 2 plots, Huazhaizi desert maize field and Linze grassland. The dataset of ground truth measurement was synchronizing with WiDAS (Wide-angle Infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner), OMIS-II, Landsat TM and ASTER.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives of collecting surface radiation temperature data using thermal imagers in various environmental settings such as oases, deserts, and grassland areas are to understand the thermal properties and energy exchange processes of different land cover types. This data collection aims to provide insights into how these environments respond to climatic factors, which can be crucial for modeling ecological and hydrological processes. The data also supports the calibration and validation of airborne and satellite-based remote sensing instruments.",
