            "description": "Due to human activities and climate change, the habitats of ungulate species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have been greatly affected in recent decades. In this study, the distribution patterns of 19 ungulate species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were identified using the MaxEnt model based on circuit theory. Ecological corridors were identified and analyzed using Circuitscape 4.0 software. Finally, a total of two ecological network datasets for typical agricultural and pastoral areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1990 and 2015 were obtained. The results showed that the MaxEnt model could well predict the distribution of hoofed species, and most of the hoofed species were mainly distributed in the southeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The key protected areas identified by the zoning model were mainly located in the southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. The existing nature reserves can effectively protect suitable habitats for Tibetan antelope, Tibetan wild ass and wild yak. This study can provide a scientific basis for reconciling the contradiction between development and conservation and promoting biodiversity conservation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

By employing electric circuit theory and the MaxEnt model, researchers were able to identify distribution patterns of ungulates for both past (1990) and present (2015) timeframes. The integration of Circuitscape4.0 software for ecological corridor analysis further enhanced the understanding of habitat connectivity and conservation needs.",
