            "description": "As the “third pole” of the world, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is extremely ecologically sensitive and fragile while facing increasing human activities and overgrazing. In this study, eight types of spatial data were firstly selected, including grazing intensity, Night-Time Light, population density, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) density, the ratio of cultivated land, the slope of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), distance to road, and distance to town. Then, the entropy weight method was applied to determine the weight of each factor. Finally, the five-year interval human activity intensity data in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 were made in the agricultural and pastoral areas of QTP through the spatial overlap method. By preparing the historical spatial datasets of human activity intensity, our study will help to explore the influence of human disturbance on the alpine ecosystems on the QTP and provide effective support for decision-making of government aiming at regional ecosystem management and sustainable development.",

                "In remote sensing application research, nighttime light remote sensing has become an important and rapidly developing branch that has garnered increasing attention from both natural science and socio-economic fields in recent years. Unlike traditional optical remote sensing satellites that acquire radiative information of surface objects, nighttime light remote sensing captures information on visible light and near-infrared electromagnetic waves emitted from the Earth's surface under cloud-free conditions at night. Compared to ordinary remote sensing satellite images, the nighttime light images record surface light intensity information that more directly reflects human activity differences, and thus are widely used in studies of urbanization processes, impervious surface extraction, spatial estimation of socio-economic indicators, assessment of major events, and ecological environment evaluation. Thanks to the capability of nighttime light remote sensing images for large-scale, long-term observation of the Earth's surface, their open data products can effectively support research on human activities and urbanization processes. In recent years, with the continuous enrichment of light remote sensing data products, particularly the emergence of the new generation of nighttime light data NPP/VIIRS (National Polar-Orbiting Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), the shortcomings of DMSP/OLS nighttime light data in terms of spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and radiometric resolution have been effectively addressed, greatly expanding the research directions and application fields of nighttime light data."

As nations around the world started to develop their economies based on fossil fuel consumption, the stage was set for global warming and global environmental change. Electric power stations consume mostly fossil fuels and the night-time light emitted by human activity increases the consumption of electric power.

                "Diabetes is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases among the older adults worldwide. The 2017 China Diabetes Prevalence Survey showed that the prevalence of diabetes in the older adults aged ≥ 60 years was 30.0%, and China has the largest number of older adults with diabetes in the world. Various acute and chronic complications caused by diabetes seriously affect the health status and quality of life of the older adults. Frailty, an emerging global health burden, is a common geriatric syndrome. A meta-analysis of 21 studies from Western high-income countries showed the prevalence of frailty among community-dwelling older adults ranges from 4 to 59%, with an average prevalence of 11%, the pooled prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty among community-dwelling older adults in China were 10 and 43%, respectively, leading to an increased risk of falls, disability, hospitalization, and death, as well as an independent predictor of higher healthcare expenditure among older adults. As populations age, diabetes and frailty are frequently co-occurring health outcomes, and both frailty and diabetes increase the risk of adverse outcomes in older adults. A meta-analysis showed that older adults with diabetes with frailty had significantly increased risks of hospitalization, disability, and death compared with older adults with diabetes who were not frail. Studies have shown that frailty was an important factor affecting the target level of blood glucose management in the older adults with diabetes. The International Position Statement on Frailty in Diabetes emphasized that the identification and assessment of frailty should be part of the routine management of people with diabetes. Compared with developed countries, the research on frailty in the older adults in China started relatively recently, there were few comprehensive studies on the prevalence and associated factors of frailty and pre-frailty among older adults with diabetes nationwide."
