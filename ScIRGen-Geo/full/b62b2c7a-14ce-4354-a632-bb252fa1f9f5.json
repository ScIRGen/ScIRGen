(2020). Asymmetric impacts of dryness and wetness on tree growth and forest coverage. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 288-289, 107980. doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.107980.\nIn this paper the researchers took forests in the semi-arid area of the Colorado Plateau in the southwest USA as the research object, comprehensively applied a large amount of tree ring width data, combined with remote sensing forest coverage data, they explored the legacy effect under the influence of the interannual water deficit by designing \"natural experiments\" at the regional scale, and compared the similarities and differences of the effect of the interannual water status changes on the tree ring width and forest coverage. The study found that the water status in the year when the tree ring was formed can significantly affect the duration and intensity of the legacy effect, and the response of the tree ring width and forest coverage to the interannual water status is different. \nThis data contains ring-width indices (RWI) of 357 sample sites in 111-hydrological year (i.e., for 1902–2012) and annual water deficit anomaly (Dya) that matched to RWI.\nThe tree-ring database used in this research was composed of 357 standard chronologies of three major species (Pinus edulis Engelm., Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex C. Lawson and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the study region, spanning from 1902 to 2012, resulting in a total of 29,969 site-years. A total of 357 tree-ring width chronologies of three major tree species were obtained from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/tree-ring). To transform tree-ring width data into ring-width indices (RWI), long-term trends caused by aging and increasing trunk diameter were mostly removed by negative exponential curves using the ARSTAN program (Cook, 1985). After performing standardization, all chronologies were scaled to a standard mean (RWI = 1000) with a comparable variance to reduce the spatial heterogeneity among these tree-ring sites.\nIn this research, researchers used annual water deficit anomaly (Dya) to explore the impact of water deficit variability on tree radial growth and growth legacies. They matched gridded Dya to RWIs. For tree-ring chronologies within the same grid, they averaged them for each year to reduce bias caused by the rough resolution of climate data.\nThe data is 1 Excel workbooks, Ring-width indices and annual water deficit anomaly (1902-2012), which contains 3 worksheets as follows:\nraw_data\nprocessed_data\nvariables\nThe data contains the following fields:\nsitename: the name of tree-ring sampled site\nYear: the tree-ring formation year\nRWI: ring-width indices\nlatitude: the latitude of tree-ring sampled site\nlontitude: the lontitude of tree-ring sampled site\naltitude: the altitude of tree-ring sampled site\nlon Grid no.: the lontitude grid number of tree-ring sampled site\nlat Grid no.: the latitude grid number of tree-ring sampled site\nDya_3: water deficit anomaly of the 3rd year before the tree-ring formation year (i.e. \"Year\" column) \nDya_2: water deficit anomaly of the 2nd year before the tree-ring formation year (i.e. \"Year\" column) \nDya_1: water deficit anomaly of the 1st year before the tree-ring formation year (i.e. \"Year\" column) \nDya_curr: water deficit anomaly of the tree-ring formation year (i.e. \"Year\" column) \nDya_std: the standard  deviation of 111-hydrological year (i.e., for 1902–2012) averaged annual water deficit of the grid",

                "The prevalence of legacy effects, especially in drought-prone forests, makes the accurate assessment of forest dynamics under frequent climate fluctuations challenging. Forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly vulnerable in the face of climate change, especially in semiarid regions. Intensified drought stress, now generally agreed upon as the most widespread and frequent threat to many forests, has led to recent higher tree mortality rate and forest die-off episodes. Although a meteorological water budget can be constantly monitored, its impacts on tree growth and forest dynamics are quite uncertain. One important reason is the pervasive existence of legacies (i.e. the lagged responses to extreme events) in forest ecosystems. Observational research generally revealed 1- to 4-year long legacies recorded in tree-rings at regional to global scales and presented the recovery process of tree growth after droughts. Similarly, the enhancement of radial growth after extreme wetness could also be observed for 1 to 5 years. So far, most related studies focused on lagged impacts of past extreme years or events on current growth; however, current water condition immediately influence current growth, which may alter or offset the ecological impacts of past extremes. In addition, despite the abundance of evidence on the significant legacy effects recorded in tree-rings, whether these growth legacies could be upscaled to the level of a whole forest have not been fully discussed."

We hypothesized that the temporal pattern of legacy effect changes when effects from multiple years are superimposed on top of one another. We also hypothesized that the response of tree growth to the shift of interannual water deficit condition is rapid and intense, but forest coverage does not have obvious changes in a short period."

Furthermore, our results revealed that growth dynamics observed in tree rings were not fully consistent with the dynamic of forest coverage. Wetness enhanced growth pronouncedly, whereas normal to wet conditions only barely maintained the stability of forest coverage, suggesting that tree growth is more sensitive to wetness than forest coverage. In addition, the impact of consecutive dry years on tree radial growth showed no significant difference from that of a single dry year, but the decline of forest coverage accelerated after consecutive droughts."

                "AnswerEn": "To account for spatial heterogeneity, standard mean scaling of tree-ring chronologies to comparable variance could be employed. Additionally, averaging tree-ring indices within grid cells and designing regional-scale natural experiments can help understand the legacy effects on forest coverage dynamics.",

                "AnswerEn": "Standardizing tree-ring data is crucial to eliminate long-term trends caused by aging and diameter growth, allowing for a more accurate analysis of climate effects on growth. The ARSTAN program is used, which applies a negative exponential curve to transform tree-ring width data into ring-width indices (RWI), helping to reduce spatial heterogeneity among different sites.",

To address these uncertainties, it is suggested to update metadata with details like the tree's diameter at breast height and microenvironment information, which could provide a clearer context for interpreting the data.",
