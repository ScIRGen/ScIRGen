The reconstructions of OR and Ridge are highly variable in amplitude because of the high sensitivity to noises in proxies, which may produce spurious estimates.

The CatBoost reconstruction has the highest correlation coefficient (R = 0.93, p < 0.01) with the NAM index over the instrumental period and is able to better fit the magnitude and peak-to-valley variability of the NAM index. The positive shift of NAM from 1950 A.D. to 2000 A.D. is unprecedented in the past 1000 years. We further found that prior to 1850 A.D., the multi-decadal variability of NAM was mainly influenced by the global mean temperature, with warm periods corresponding to an enhanced NAM and cold periods corresponding to a weakened NAM. While after 1850 A.D., the multi-decadal changes of NAM tend to coincide with sea ice extent in the Barents-Kara Sea."

These proxies are essential for understanding long-term changes and mechanisms of atmospheric circulation modes like the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) when direct observational data is unavailable.",

This process may include selecting relevant proxies, removing missing and anomalous data, and applying correlation analysis to identify relationships that help refine the dataset used for reconstructing climate variables such as the NAM.",

It involves dividing the data into calibration and validation periods to test how well the model can generalize to new, unseen data. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the reconstructed climate indices, as indicated by the correlation and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) results.",
