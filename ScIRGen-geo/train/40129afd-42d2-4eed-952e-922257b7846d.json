            "description": "The data set includes: longitude and latitude, lithological information, chronological data and O isotopic composition, major and trace elements and Sr Nd isotopic composition of Early Cretaceous high Mg diorite and granodiorite samples from Tengchong block, Yunnan Province. The chronological data of rock samples are determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of magmatic zircon separated from single rock ore. during the testing process, Qinghu standard zircon is used as the monitoring sample to monitor the reliability of the whole analysis and testing process. The main elements were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) by melting the rock powder into a glass sheet which can be tested on the computer. The analytical accuracy of the standard materials gbw-07111, gbw-123, gsr-1, gsr-2 and gsr-3 was better than 2%; Trace elements were analyzed by Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the process of analysis and test, USGS reference materials (bhvo-2, avg-2, gsr-1, gsr-2, gsr-3, gsd-9 and sarm-4) were determined. As the external test standard, the element content of the test sample was more accurate than 3%. The oxygen isotope data are obtained by SIMS of detrital zircon. The external accuracy of the multiple determination results of Penglai standard sample is better than 0.30 ‰ (2 σ，  n = 24)。 The SR Nd isotopic compositions of rocks were determined by the Neptune multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) using nbs987 (87Sr / 86Sr = 0.71025) and shin Etsu jndi-1 (143Nd / 144Nd = 0.512115) as reference materials. The data obtained are used to identify early Cretaceous high Mg diorite related to subduction sediments in the eastern margin of Tengchong block, which provides evidence for the southeastern extension of Bangong Nujiang suture zone. The research results are published in the international well-known Journal LITHOS.",

                    "Answer": "Using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for zircon dating allows researchers to obtain precise geochronological data, which is crucial for understanding the formation history and geochemical characteristics of early Cretaceous plutonic rocks. This method provides reliable age determinations by measuring isotopic compositions in zircon minerals, which are resistant to alteration and provide a robust record of the crystallization age. In this context, the SIMS technique helps identify the relationship between high-magnesium diorite and granodiorite samples and subducted sediments, providing evidence for tectonic processes at the southeastern extension of the Bangong Lake-Nujiang suture zone.",

                    "Answer": "To accurately measure the geochemical composition and isotopic data of early Cretaceous igneous rock samples in the Tengchong region of Yunnan, several procedures and instruments are utilized. The age of rock samples is determined using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on magmatic zircon, with Qinghu standard zircon as a control for reliability during analysis. Major elements are measured using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) on rock powder melted into glass beads, with an analytical precision better than 2% for standard materials such as GBW-07111, GBW-123, GSR-1, GSR-2, and GSR-3. Trace elements are analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), with a precision better than 3% using USGS standards like BHVO-2, AVG-2, GSR-1, GSR-2, GSR-3, GSD-9, and SARM-4. Oxygen isotope data is obtained from detrital zircon using SIMS, where the external precision from multiple measurements of the Penglai standard is better than 0.30‰ (2σ, n = 24). Sr-Nd isotopes are measured by dissolving the rock powder in acid and analyzing the solution on a Neptune multi-collector ICP-MS, using NBS987 and Shin Etsu JNdi-1 standards as controls.",
