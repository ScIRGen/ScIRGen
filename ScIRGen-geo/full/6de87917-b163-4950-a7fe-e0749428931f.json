            "description": "The single mineral dating data set of magmatic rocks in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is mainly zircon dating in some areas of the Hoh Xil Lhasa plate, with 34 zircon dating samples. The samples are mainly from baohu, guoganjianianshan and Dugur areas of South Qiangtang, Saga county and narusongduo areas of Lhasa plate. The rocks are mainly quartz monzonite, granite and diorite. The zircon dating methods include Sims and LA-ICPMS. The data comes from published articles or in the acceptance stage. The data were published in SCI or Ni journals, including geology, BSA bulletin and Journal of petroleum, and the data results were true and reliable. The main testing unit is Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data set can be used to study the age of magmatic rocks in different areas of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",
