            "description": "PML-V2(China) terrestrial evapotranspiration and total primary productivity dataset, including five elements: gross primary product (GPP), vegetation transpiration (Ec), soil evaporation (Es), vaporization of intercepted rainfall (Ei) and water body, ice and snow evaporation (ET_water). The dataset has a spatial-temporal resolution of daily and 500-meter from Feb.26, 2000 to Dec.31, 2020.\n\nCompared with the global version, the simulation accuracy of the PML-V2(China) product has been greatly improved, which has the following improvements and innovations:\n\nI. Compared with the 8-day temporal resolution of the global version, the new product is daily; \nII. The observation data are from 26 eddy flux stations in China, which are with 9 underlying surface types including deserts with sparse vegetation, and used for the parameter calibration of the model (there are only eight stations located in China for calibrating the global PML-V2, covering only five vegetation types); \nIII. China meteorological forcing dataset for 2000-2018 and the global land surface data assimilation system GLDAS-2.1 meteorological dataset with bias correction for 2019-2020 are used to replace the original 0.25 ° GLDAS meteorological inputs;\nIV. The ERA5-Land as the input surface temperature instead of air temperature to calculate the outgoing longwave radiation; and\nV. Taking the MODIS leaf area index by the improved Whittaker filter as the model input, the new product provides new insights into monitoring crop water consumption and reveals the characteristics of the planting system.\n\nPlease note that the dataset does not include the South China Sea.",

                    "Answer": "A daily time resolution allows for more accurate and detailed monitoring of rapid changes in land surface processes such as evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity. This increased temporal resolution can capture daily variations in weather conditions and plant physiological responses, leading to a more precise simulation of these processes compared to an eight-day resolution.",

                    "Answer": "The improved simulation accuracy in the China region is attributed to several factors: increasing the temporal resolution from eight days to daily, using observational data from 26 eddy covariance flux stations across diverse vegetation types, employing higher-resolution regional meteorological data for 2000-2018, and bias-corrected GLDAS-2.1 meteorological data for 2019-2020, replacing air temperature with ERA5 land surface temperature for input in calculating longwave radiation, and using an improved Whittaker-filtered MODIS leaf area index as a model input.",

                    "Answer": "Improving the temporal resolution from eight days to daily enhances the accuracy and detail of land evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity estimates. This higher resolution allows for more precise monitoring of daily variations in these processes, capturing short-term changes and extremes that might be missed with coarser temporal granularity. This can lead to better understanding and management of water resources and ecosystem productivity at finer temporal scales.",

                    "Answer": "The objectives behind developing a dataset focusing on daily land surface processes in China likely include improving simulation accuracy for regional climate models, agricultural planning, and water resource management. These goals are reflected in the choice of data collection methods, such as using observations from 26 eddy covariance flux towers across diverse vegetation types, employing high-resolution meteorological inputs, and integrating advanced data assimilation systems. These strategies aim to enhance the precision and applicability of the dataset in understanding and managing regional land-atmosphere interactions.",

                    "Answer": "The enhancement of temporal resolution from an eight-day to a daily interval in a dataset is achieved through the integration of high-frequency observational data from flux stations and the recalibration of models with localized data. In this specific context, data from 26 eddy covariance flux stations across China, covering diverse vegetation types, are utilized to calibrate the model for higher accuracy. Additionally, the use of ERA5 land surface temperature data replaces air temperature as input, further refining the temporal detail and accuracy.",
