            "description": "Land Surface Temporature (LST) is a key parameter in global change research, and it has important for ecosystems and biogeochemistry. At present, Landsat thermal infrared series satellite data (including Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI thermal infrared bands) is an important data source for land surface temperature estimation. Taking the key nodes of Dhaka as the research area, using the data of Landsat TM/ETM+/TIRS series with good quality (less than 20% cloud) from 2000 to 2016 as inputs, the single channel algorithm (SC) was used to predict the land surface temperature. At the same time, reflectance correction based on NDVI sources was considered to allow for more accurate LST estimation of different regions and conditions. Finally, the annual quarterly (approximate) land surface temperature data of Dhaka key node area during 2000 and 2016  was obtained. Note: Because the data in this area was seriously interfered by the cloud cover, the LST data was cloud masked.",

Cloud interference can obscure the satellite's view of the Earth's surface, resulting in missing or distorted data. To mitigate this, cloud mask processing is applied, which helps to filter out cloud-contaminated data, improving the reliability of the temperature estimates despite these challenges.",
