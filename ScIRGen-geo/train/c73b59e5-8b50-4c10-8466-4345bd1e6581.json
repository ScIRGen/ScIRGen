            "description": "This dataset includes new stable isotope data from the Han Dynasty Huangwan tombs in central Gansu. The central part of Gansu was the key node of the Han and Xiongnu empires. The stable isotope analysis of C and N was carried out in the Key Laboratory of Western Environment of the Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University, and the detection of C% and N% was commissioned by the State Key Laboratory of Functional Organic Molecular Chemistry, Lanzhou University. After the bone and tooth samples were pre-processed, the C and N stable isotope data sets were obtained by isotope ratio mass spectrometer tests connected to the Thermo Finnigan DeltaPlus, and the C% and N% data sets were obtained by the vario EL cube element analyzer tests. According to plant remains and stable isotope data, millet cultivation is a typical agricultural activity of Han people in Central China, and also the main lifestyle of Huangwan people in central Gansu Province. More importantly, this is fundamentally different from the agricultural practices of the Gansu Corridor during the Bronze Age, which were based on a variety of crops such as wheat, barley, and millet. This significant shift in Huangwan's self-production can be linked to a broader historical context in which the Han Empire showed an increasing political and military presence in the Gansu corridor, suggesting that local indigenous nomads followed the Han lifestyle (e.g., millet cultivation) and/or Han immigrants maintained millet cultivation.",

In the context of the Han dynasty central Gansu, it helps understand the shift in agricultural practices, indicating a move from diverse grain cultivation to millet-based agriculture, reflecting changes in lifestyle influenced by broader historical and cultural contexts.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods for obtaining stable C and N isotopes from skeletal samples involve isotopic ratio mass spectrometry, which provides detailed insights into the dietary habits of ancient populations by analyzing bone and tooth samples. This method is particularly effective in revealing shifts in agricultural practices, such as the transition to millet cultivation. In contrast, analyzing plant remains typically involves archaeological and botanical techniques that provide direct evidence of the types of crops cultivated, such as identifying seeds or pollen. While isotopic analysis offers a broader picture of dietary patterns and changes over time, plant remains analysis provides concrete evidence of specific crops, potentially offering greater specificity in identifying agricultural practices.",

It provides insights into the significant shift in agricultural practices towards millet cultivation, which was a typical activity of the Han Chinese and different from the Bronze Age practices in the Gansu corridor.",

This represents a significant shift from the Bronze Age agricultural practices in the Gansu Corridor, which were based on diverse crops like wheat, barley, and millet. This change can be linked to the increasing political and military presence of the Han Empire in the Gansu Corridor, suggesting that local indigenous nomads adopted Han lifestyles, such as millet farming, or Han immigrants continued millet cultivation.",
