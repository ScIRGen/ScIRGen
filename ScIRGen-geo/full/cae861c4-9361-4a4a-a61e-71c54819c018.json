            "description": "With the rapid global warming in recent decades, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has suffered severe impacts, such as glacier retreat, glacial lake expansion, and permafrost degradation, which threaten the lives and properties of the local and downstream populations. Regional Reanalysis (RR) is vital for TP due to the lack and limitations of observations. In this work, a 62-year (1961-2022) long atmospheric regional reanalysis with spatial resolution of 9 km and temporal resolution of 1 hour over the TP (TPRR) was developed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, combined with re-initialization method, spectral nudging (SN), and several optimizations. TPRR is forced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global reanalysis ERA5 data at hourly intervals. The cumulus parameterization is switched off at gray-zone scale (9 km). Compared to ERA5, TPRR captures more realistically both the climatological characteristics and seasonal variations of precipitation and air temperature at 2m above ground level (T2m). Moreover, TPRR better reproduces the frequency and intensity of precipitation, as well as the diurnal cycle of precipitation. This study also quantifies the wetting trend of 0.0071 mm/year over the TP in the background of global warming using TPRR.",

Based on the previous studies over the TP, the following physical parameterization schemes were used in this study: RRTMG longwave and short-wave radiative transfer scheme, the Unified Noah land surface model (NOAH), Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 2.5 (MYNN2.5) planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization and Thompson microphysics parameterization scheme. In this study, the initial fields of SD and SWE in ERA5 are replaced by those from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), which is closer to in-situ observations and IMS. In this study, the re-initialization strategy was adopted, and the spectral nudging (SN) method which is considered as an indirect assimilation method and can prevent the simulation from drifting away from the forcing, was applied to wind fields above planetary boundary layer (PBL)."
