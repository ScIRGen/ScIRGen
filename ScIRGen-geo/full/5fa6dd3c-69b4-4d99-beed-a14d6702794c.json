            "description": "This data is the chronological, grain size and bulk density data of loess-paleosol sequence in Wenchuan (WCH) in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We measured the median grain size and bulk density data of the profile (10m) at intervals of 2.5cm and 5cm respectively. The OSL dating experiment was carried out in the Luminescence Dating Laboratory of the Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education) in Lanzhou University. AMS 14C measurements  were carried out at Peking University. The experimental analysis of environmental indicators was also completed at the Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education) in Lanzhou University. The OSL ages were determined by an automated Risø TL/OSL DA-20 reader. The grain size data were measured by a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer; the bulk density data were determined by the oil-soaked method. This data provides the detailed chronological data of loess-paleosol sequence and the variation characteristics of grain size and bulk density since the last glacial period in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and provides an important data reference for understanding paleoclimate evolution and dust accumulation history in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.",
