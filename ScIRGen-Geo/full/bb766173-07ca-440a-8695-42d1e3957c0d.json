Mass balance is glacier surface algebra and the amount of accumulation and ablation, reflects the dueling glacier surface per unit area on the end of a material balance, material balance of the average ice changes in status. According to the field observation data, the flower stem observation was a single point of material balance: bn = bs + bi + bsi, bn, bi, bs, bsi, representing a single point of material balance, glacial ice, snow and additional ice equilibrium value and the calculated results indicated on large scale ice figure and topographic map, draw the scope contour for 50 m spacing ablation, accumulated value.In addition, the 4700 m observation point was calculated, monthly flower stem and accumulation of snow melting pit water equivalent. Respectively of accumulation and ablation area between every two adjacent contours, and then calculate the glaciers are melting area gradually glacier melting pure accumulation of C and pure quantity and material balance value B. By using the spatial interpolation method, Arcgis software product contour map, glacier mass balance calculation was realized. The glaciers annual net mass balanceB is 𝐵=Σ𝑏𝑖（𝑠𝑖/S𝑛i）, si for two adjacent contour projection area;Bi for si average net balance;N is the total number of si;S for the total area of the glacier.\n3.Data quality description: Flowers rod with a tape measure different positions in the observation of exposed height value, and the height of the rod, the additional section thickness of ice, snow and dirt layer depth, etc. The unit is mm water equivalent w.e.

During the period of observation, some flower rod dumping or covered by snow, unable to obtain valid data.\n4.Data application results and prospects: The data can provide parameter calibration and verification for the study of glacier dynamics model and simulation.",

                "Glaciers have long been classified as “temperate” and “polar” glacier (Ahlmann, 1935) or “temperate”, “sub-continental” and “polar continental” glacier in terms of geophysical properties (Shi, 2005), a temperate glacier being one that is at the melting point throughout except for a thin surface layer subject to seasonal cooling. A temperate glacier reacts very sensitive to air temperature than a sub- and polar continental glacier. The thermodynamic state of a glacier ice is subject to both seasonal and long-term climatic changes (Zagorodnov et al., 2006) and strongly determines their behavior (Blatter, 1987). Generally, a glacier’s active-layer temperature (ALT) depends on air temperature, accumulation, firn density, solar radiation, clouds (long wave radiation), surface albedo, wind (speed and direction), melt water runoff, percolation and refreezing of melt water, ice flow, the surface net energy balance and other parameters (Salamatin, 2000; Paterson, 1994; Harrison, 1972). The glacier’s ALT studies at home and abroad began in 1930s (Nye, 1953), while the deep borehole temperature in the late 1950s (Budd et al., 1976). Since the 1970s, most research of borehole temperatures focused on the continental and polar glaciers, especially in Antarctica, Greenland, Alps, Rockies, Svalbard and Himalayas, etc. (Sobota, 2011; Han et al., 1995; Haeberli and Funk, 1991; Blatter and Kappenberger, 1988). Most researchers emphasize four different contents: (a) firn temperatures measured in shallow holes (Alean et al., 1983); (b) heat exchange and thermal conductivity in the active layer (Xie et al., 1998; Funk et al., 1994); (c) temperature gradients and heat fluxes at the glacier base (Wegmann et al., 1998; Oeschger et al., 1977); and (d) the relationship between air temperature and the active-layer temperature (Zagorodnov et al., 2006). There are also detailed studies of spatial distribution of borehole temperature, especially in ice cap and the tongue of glacier (Robin and De, 1995; Haeberli and Alean, 1985). However, as of now, relatively few studies concentrated on the thermal regime of temperate glaciers except for several glaciers in the earlier period (Li et al., 2007; Mikhalenko, 1997; Huang et al., 1982)."

                "Due to many ice crevasses everywhere in summer and autumn and large solid precipitation in winter and spring, the temperature profiles are often either buried for several months or some thermistors are damaged, which brought greater difficulties and challenges for continuous boreholes temperature monitoring. However, automatic weather station (4 750 m a.s.l.) is completely buried by snowfall with about 2 500 mm, and all meteorological data cannot be gained during this period. At the same time, ice crevasse distributes all over glacier surface in the ablation period, while the borehole was buried by snow for several months in the accumulation period. Some heat-sensitive temperature probes are damaged seriously and data observation is delayed by these factors, resulting in the loss of some probes and data."

In the study, the A, B and C borehole temperatures are monitored by temperature measurement system, which includes thermistors (heat-sensitive probes), wires and ammeter. All borehole thermistors are soldered to individual two-conductor cables and waterproofed by heat-shrink tubing. All thermistors were installed in the boreholes with a vertical spacing varying each 1 m using a heat-sensitive attached to a cable. The resistance was directly measured by Digital Multimeter True RMS189 Fluke Company produced in the United States. Finally, the measured resistance is converted to temperature by Steinhart-Hart equation. In September, 2009, an automatic weather station nearby the borehole C with an altitude of 4 750 m a.s.l. was installed."

The decrease amplitude of ALT in the accumulation period was far below its increase magnitude in the ablation period. At the same time, the mean glacier ice temperatures at 10 m depth (T10) in A, B and C profile were obviously higher than most of glaciers previously studied. Measured data also showed that the mean ALT increased by 0.24 °C in 0.5–8.5 m depth of the C profile during 28 years from July 11, 1982 to July 10, 2009."
