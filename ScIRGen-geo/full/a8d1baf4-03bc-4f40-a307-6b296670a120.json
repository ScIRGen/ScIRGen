            "description": "The ecological environment in the arid regions of central Asia is fragile and sensitive to global climate change, receiving increasing attention from paleoclimatologists. Previous research has mainly focused on the northwest region of China to the east of the region, while climate proxy records in Central Asia are scarce, especially in the absence of reliable quantitative reconstruction of precipitation. This limits the understanding of regional water and heat allocation and prevents a deeper understanding of the relationship between climate change and the Silk Road civilization. In this study, the collected lake rock cores were divided into samples with a spacing of 1 cm, freeze-dried, and then tested. The samples were placed in a 50 ml test tube, and 1 stone pine spore piece was added as an indicator for calculating pollen concentration. The conventional HCl NaOH HF method is used to remove carbonates, humus, colloids, and silicides from the sample. Add sulfuric acid acetic anhydride, remove the surface protoplasm of pollen, and centrifuge with water until neutral. Introduce a small test tube, drop 2-3 drops of glycerol, seal and store. Under the framework of six AMS14C epochs, spore pollen analysis was conducted on Sasikul Lake in the Pamir Plateau. Based on current representative soil spore pollen data, the WA PLS method was used to quantitatively reconstruct the precipitation change history of the arid region in central Asia over the past 2500 years. The research results show that the herbaceous pollen represented by Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae in the pollen assemblage is absolutely dominant, with a content mostly higher than 80%. The vegetation type is mainly grassland landscape. Among them, during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the drought tolerant Chenopodiaceae pollen reached the highest level in the research section, with an average annual precipitation of 115 mm, which is about 15% lower than modern precipitation, and the climate is relatively dry; During the Little Ice Age (LIA), the pollen content of Artemisia and spruce and fir that prefer cold and humid conditions is relatively high, with an average annual precipitation of 160 mm (up to 210 mm), which is about 20% higher than modern precipitation. The climate is cold and humid. On this basis, combined with high-quality regional temperature records and archaeological data, the possible impact of climate change during historical periods on the evolution of the Silk Road civilization was explored. We believe that the temperature conditions in the water and heat allocation have the most important impact on human activities and the evolution of the Silk Road civilization in the arid regions of central Asia. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, under the warm climate background, the melting water of ice and snow significantly increased, the intensity of human settlement significantly increased, and the Silk Road civilization flourished and developed; In the Ming Dynasty, under cold climate conditions, due to the lack of freshwater input, the intensity of local human settlement was weakened, and the Silk Road civilization significantly declined. So, in the context of global warming and increased precipitation, there are new development opportunities for agriculture and socio-economic development in the arid regions of central Asia.",

Recent palaeoclimatological studies have mainly focused on northwestern China, which is located on the eastern side of the region. Holocene palaeoclimate records from the western region of ACA are scarce, thus hindering the exploration of the relationship between climate change and Silk Road civilization. The climate is mainly controlled by the westerly circulation, and the region is characterised by fragile ecosystems and water resources that are sensitive to global climate change. The ACA is a key component of the Silk Road, which is an important pathway for human migration and cultural diffusion between Europe and China. The history of East-West exchanges along the Silk Road can be traced back to prehistoric times. In recent years, pollen-based quantitative palaeoclimatic reconstructions combined with modern pollen databases have significantly improved our understanding regarding past precipitation histories and environmental changes in East Asia."
