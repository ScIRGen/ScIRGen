            "description": "The Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) played a crucial role in shaping the biodiversity in Asia during the Cenozoic. However, fossil records attributed to insects are still scarce from the QTP, which limits our understanding on the evolution of biodiversity in this large region. Fulgoridae (lanternfly) is a group of large planthopper in body size, which is found primarily in tropical regions. The majority of the Fulgoridae bear brilliant colors and elongated heads. The fossil records of Fulgoridae span from the Eocene to Miocene in the Northern Hemisphere, and only a few fossil species from Neogene deposits have been reported in Asia so far. Here, we report a new fossil record of Fulgoridae from the middle Eocene Lunpola Basin, central QTP. The specimen is in lateral compression, with complete abdomen, thorax, and part of the wings preserved, while most of the head is missing. It belongs to the “lower Fulgoroidea” judging by several strong lateral spines on the hind tibia and a row of teeth at the apex of the second metatarsomere. This fossil specimen is assigned to Fulgoridae by comparison with nine families of the “lower Fulgoroidea”. The specimen represents the earliest Fulgoridae fossil record in Asia and was considered a new morphotaxon based on the peculiar legs and wings. Based on the modern distribution of fulgorid and other paleontological evidence, we suggest a warm climate with relatively low elevation during the middle Eocene in the central QTP. Therefore, this new fossil record not only provides important information on insect diversity in the middle Eocene, but also gives new evidence on the paleoenvironment in the core area of the QTP from the perspective of an insect.",

                    "Answer": "The scarcity of insect fossil records on the Tibetan Plateau is likely due to a combination of factors, including the geological and climatic history of the region, which may have limited the preservation of such fossils. This scarcity restricts the understanding of biodiversity evolution because it provides limited direct evidence of past species and ecosystems, making it challenging to reconstruct the ecological history and biodiversity changes over time. The discovery of the earliest Eocene planthopper fossils in the central Tibetan Plateau provides crucial evidence that could help fill this gap in knowledge, suggesting that the mid-Eocene climate was warm with relatively lower altitudes in the region.",

This can help reconstruct the historical biogeographic patterns and ecological dynamics of the area, potentially offering insights into how biodiversity has been shaped by geological and climatic changes over time.",
