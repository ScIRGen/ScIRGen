            "description": "The dataset of the truck-mounted dual polarized doppler radar observations (time-continuous 10-minute on the 250m×250m horizontal grid) was obtained in A'rou (39.06°N, 100.44°E, 3002m, typical of complex terrain in high altitude), Qilian county in the upper stream of Heihe river from Mar. 14 to Apr. 14, 2008.   \n     The aim was to explore and retrieve precipitation type and intensity by radar in cold regions, with the precipitation particle drop size analyzer and ground intensive measurements occurring simultaneously, thus making it possible to produce a high resolution precipitation dataset.  \n     The 714XDP X-band dual-linear polarization Doppler weather radar was with a horizontal resolution of 150 m, an azimuth resolution of 1, VCP from 10-22 layers and the scanning cycle 10 minutes. ZH, ZDR and KDP could be acquired together. For more details, please refer to Readme file.",
