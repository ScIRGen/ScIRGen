            "titleEn": "Zircon U-Pb ages of gneissic syenogranite, orthogneiss and biotite granite and U-Pb data of columbite-tantalite in pegmatite in tugman area of Altun orogenic belt",
            "description": "This data is the U-Pb ages of zircon and niobium tantalite. Five samples (T-5 is gneissic syenogranite, T-1 is orthogneiss, T-3 and T-5 are biotite monzogranite, and T-9 is Li be mineralized pegmatite) were collected. After crushing, heavy sand minerals were separated by manual elutriation. After magnetic and electromagnetic separation,  columbite-tantalite (about 500 grains) and zircon (more than 1000 grains) were picked out under binocular lens. After selecting representative  columbite-tantalite and zircon as targets, the internal structure of columbite-tantalite was studied by BSE through microscope transmission light and reflection light photography. Zircon U-Pb chronology was conducted on the 193 nm laser ablation system (new wave) and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in Xi'an Geological Survey Center. The U-Pb geochronology test of columbite-tantalite was conducted on the s155 laser ablation system and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer  in Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.  The weighted average age of 15 spots of T-5 zircon is 900 ± 9 Ma; The weighted average age of 20 spots of T-1 zircon is 899 ± 7 Ma; The weighted average ages of zircon 21 and 14 spots of T-3 and T-5 samples are 482 ± 5 and 475 ± 5 Ma, respectively. The weighted average age of 12 spots of T-9 columbite-tantalite is 472 ± 8 ma. The data clarify the metallogenic age of Li-Be in Altun orogenic belt and provide direction for Li-Be prospecting in this area in the next step.",

                    "Answer": "The U-Pb ages of zircon and niobium-tantalum minerals suggest that the 阿尔金造山带吐格曼地区 experienced significant geological events at different times. For example, the weighted average ages of zircon from different samples indicate notable geological activity around 900 Ma, 899 Ma, and during the Ordovician period around 482-475 Ma. Additionally, the niobium-tantalum minerals with an age of 472 Ma imply a period of mineralization, providing insights into the timing of Li-Be mineralization processes. These ages help in understanding the sequence of tectonic events and guide future mineral exploration efforts in the region.",

Subsequently, under a binocular microscope, approximately 500 niobium-tantalum minerals and more than 1000 zircon grains are carefully selected. Representative samples are mounted for analysis, with photomicrography in transmitted and reflected light and BSE imaging used to study internal structures. The zircon U-Pb geochronology is conducted using a 193 nm laser ablation system and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at a geological survey center, while the niobium-tantalum mineral U-Pb geochronology is tested using a specific laser ablation system and mass spectrometry at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.",
