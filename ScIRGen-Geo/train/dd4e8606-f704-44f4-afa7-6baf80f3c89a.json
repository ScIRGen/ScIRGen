            "description": "The dataset contains the phenological camera observation data of the Mixed forest station in the downstream of Heihe integrated observatory network from August 28, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The instrument was developed and data processed by Beijing Normal University. The phenomenon camera integrates data acquisition and data transmission functions. The camera captures data by look-downward with a resolution of 1280×720. For the calculation of the greenness index and phenology, the relative greenness index (GCC, Green Chromatic Coordinate, calculated by GCC=G/(R+G+B)) needs to be calculated according to the region of interest, then the invalid value filling and filtering smoothing are performed, and finally the key phenological parameters are determined according to the growth curve fitting, such as the growth season start date, Peak, growth season end, etc. For coverage, first, select images with less intense illumination, then divide the image into vegetation and soil, calculate the proportion of vegetation pixels in each image in the calculation area. After the time series data is extracted, the original coverage data is smoothed and filtered according to the time window specified by the user, and the filtered result is the final time series coverage. This data set includes relative greenness index (Gcc).\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for sites information in the Citation section.",
            "descriptionCn": "该数据集包含2019年8月28日至2019年12月31日黑河流域地表过程综合观测网下游混合林站的物候相机观测数据，该仪器由北京师范大学自主研发并进行处理。物候相机集成数据获取与数据传输功能。该物候相机采用垂直向下的方式采集数据，拍摄数据分辨率为1280*720，可指定拍摄时间频率。对于绿度指数物候期计算，需要根据感兴趣区域计算相对绿度指数（GCC, Green Chromatic Coordinate公式为GCC=G/(R+G+B), R、G、B为图像红、绿、蓝三通道像元值），然后进行无效值填充和滤波平滑，最后根据生长曲线拟合确定关键物候期参数，如生长季起始日、顶峰、生长季结束日等；对于覆盖度，首先进行数据预处理，选择光照不太强的图像，然后将图像分割为植被和土壤，计算每张图像的植被像素占计算区域内的比例作为该图像对应的覆盖度，在时间序列数据提取完成以后，再按用户指定的时间窗口对原始覆盖度数据进行平滑滤波，滤波后的得结果为最终的时间序列覆盖度。本数据集包括相对绿度指数（Gcc）。\n黑河流域地表过程综合观测网或站点信息请参考Liu et al.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
