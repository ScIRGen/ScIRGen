            "description": "\tThe dataset contains the phenological camera observation data of the Sidaoqiao Superstation in the downstream reaches of Heihe integrated observatory network before May 31 and after September 2, 2020. Due to the power failure of phenological camera, the time is lost from May 31 to September 2, 2020. In addition, after the camera was moved and reinstalled, the object in the field of view before May 31 and after September 2 would change, which may cause the inconsistency of the data before and after. The site (101.137° E, 42.001° N) was located on a tamarix (Tamarix chinensis Lour.) surface in the Sidaoqiao, Dalaihubu Town, Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The elevation is 873 m. The instrument was developed and data processed by Beijing Normal University. The phenomenon camera integrates data acquisition and data transmission functions. The camera captures data by look-downward with a resolution of 1280×720. For the calculation of the phenology, firstly, The phenological index needs to be calculated according to the region of interest. Such as, the relative greenness index (GCC, Green Chromatic Coordinate, calculated by GCC=G/(R+G+B)). Then, controlling the quality of data, filling the invalid value and filtering smoothing are performed. Finally, the key phenological parameters are determined according to the growth curve fitting, such as the growth season start date, peak, growth season end, etc. This data set includes the relative greenness index (GCC) in 2020.\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for sites information in the Citation section.",

                "Arid and semiarid regions represent approximately 30 % of the global terrestrial surface area (Dregne, 1991; Scanlon et al., 2006), and dryland expansion occurs under climate change, especially in developing countries (Huang et al., 2016). An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
