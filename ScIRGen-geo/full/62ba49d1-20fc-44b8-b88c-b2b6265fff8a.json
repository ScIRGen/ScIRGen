            "description": "Zircon U-Pb dating of host rocks and Re Os isotopic data of Molybdenite in luokuidong molybdenum deposit, Hainan Island, was commissioned by the Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The selected zircon target was used for LA-ICP-MS experimental data collection. Helium was used as carrier gas, and the laser spot diameter was 31 μ m. The pulse frequency is 8 Hz, and the analysis time of each point is 60 s, including 20 s background test and 40 s sample signal. The elements tested include u, th, Pb and their isotopic ratios. Icpmsdata cal 8.6 software was used for zircon U-Pb dating and trace element data processing, and isoplot V3.0 software was used for concordance mapping. The State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences was entrusted to test the Re Os isotope of molybdenite. Firstly, the samples of Molybdenite were crushed and screened, and the minerals such as quartz, chalcopyrite and pyrite associated with molybdenite were removed or avoided, The instrument is Thermo Scientific X-Series 2 ICP-MS. the experimental process mainly includes four steps: sample decomposition, distillation separation of OS, extraction separation of RE and mass spectrometry. The national standard gbw04435 and 04436 are used as standard samples to monitor the reliability of chemical process and analysis data. The Re Os isotopic analysis data of molybdenite is completed by isoplot 3.00 program.\nThis data can provide data support for geochemical model analysis of luokuidong molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island.\nThe above data are published in the core journal of geochemistry, the data are true and reliable, and the data are stored in the form of Excel.",

                    "Answer": "Using LA-ICP-MS with helium as a carrier gas in collecting zircon U-Pb dating data is significant because it allows for precise and accurate measurement of isotopic ratios and trace elements within the zircon samples. Helium is used as a carrier gas to efficiently transport the ablated material from the laser to the mass spectrometer, minimizing signal loss and enhancing the sensitivity of the analysis. This method is critical for determining the age and geochemical characteristics of the zircon, which are essential for understanding the geochronology and petrogenesis of mineral deposits.",

The careful selection of zircon samples and their preparation for laser ablation, the avoidance of minerals like quartz and pyrite during molybdenite sample preparation, and the use of recognized standards (e.g., GBW04435 and 04436) to monitor chemical processes and ensure data reliability all contribute to the accuracy of the data. Additionally, the use of software such as ICPMSDataCal and Isoplot for data processing and plotting plays a critical role in ensuring the precision of the analysis.",
