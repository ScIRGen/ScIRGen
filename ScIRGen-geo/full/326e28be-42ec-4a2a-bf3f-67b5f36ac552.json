                    "Answer": "Digitizing historical maps into digital formats such as ESRI Shapefile can lead to improved accuracy in land classification by providing a structured and standardized method for data analysis. It enables easier manipulation and integration with other geographic datasets, facilitating comprehensive analysis of desertification trends. However, there might be challenges related to the accuracy of the original maps, potential loss of detail during the digitization process, and discrepancies in scale or projection that could affect the precision of land classification outcomes.",

These are stored in ESRI Shapefile format, including layers like desertification types, rivers, roads, reservoirs, railways, and land divisions. The data attributes are organized into categories such as desertification level, vegetation type, and landforms. The projection information follows the Beijing 1954 datum with specific parameters for angular unit, prime meridian, and spheroid.",
