            "description": "According to the global soil map. Net standard, the 0-1m soil depth is divided into 5 layers: 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm and 60-100cm. According to the principle of soil landscape model, the spatial distribution data products of soil organic carbon content in different layers are produced by using the digital soil mapping method. The source data of this data set comes from the soil profile data integrated by the major research plan integration project of Heihe River Basin (soil data integration and soil information product generation of Heihe River Basin, 91325301).\nScope: Heihe River Basin;            \nProjection: WGS · 1984 · Albers;            \nSpatial resolution: 100M;            \nData format: TIFF;            \nDataset content:            \nhh_soc_layer1.tif: 0-5cm soil organic carbon content;            \nhh_soc_layer2.tif: 5-15cm soil organic carbon content;            \nhh_soc_layer3.tif: 15-30cm soil organic carbon content;            \nhh_soc_layer4.tif: 30-60cm soil organic carbon content;            \nhh_soc_layer5.tif: 60-100cm soil organic carbon content;",
