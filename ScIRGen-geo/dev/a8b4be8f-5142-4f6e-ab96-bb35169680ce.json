            "description": "Palynomorphs from the Zhangdong and Yali formations at Yalai Devonian–Carboniferous boundary section, Nyalam (GPS coordinates: 86°7′0.54″E, 28°23′27.94″N) are investigated in detail during this study. Based on quantitative analysis of the relative abundances of various palynomorphs, two palynological assemblages are recognized in the Famennian-Tournaisian boundary beds of the Yalai section. In ascending order, they are the Retispora lepidophyta–Verrucosisporites irregularis (LI) assemblage and the Retispora lepidophyta–Vallatisporites vallatus (LV) assemblage. Both assemblages are tentatively correlated with the Famennian LN Biozone of Western Europe because of the appearance of Retispora lepidophyta and other index spores such as Vallatisporites verrucosus, Vallatisporites pusillites, Indotriradites explanatus, and Densosporites spitsbergensis in both palynological assemblages. The lower limestones of the Yali Formation yield biostratigraphic markers for the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, including the conodont Siphonodella sulcata and Protognathodus kockeli, correlated with the Famennian VI Biozone from Western Europe. The palynomorphs assemblages have great significance for biostratigraphy subdivision ad correlation around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. This dataset include identification lists from the Yalai section.",

These challenges are compounded by the necessity to correlate these findings with established biostratigraphic zones, such as the Famennian stage LN zone in Western Europe, and to align them with conodont biostratigraphy, which requires accurate identification of standard markers like Siphonodella sulcata and Protognathodus kockeli.",
