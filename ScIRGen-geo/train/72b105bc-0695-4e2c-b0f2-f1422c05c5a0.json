            "description": "This data set contains data of meteorological elements observation system of farmland station downstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2015 to October 29, 2015.The station is located at sidao bridge, dalai hubu town, ejin banner, Inner Mongolia.The latitude and longitude of the observation point are 101.1338e, 42.0048n, and 875m above sea level.The four-component radiometer is installed at 6m, facing due south;The two infrared thermometer sensors are installed at the position of 6m, facing south, and the probe is facing vertically downward.The two photosynthetic radiometers are installed at the position of 6m, facing due south, and the probes are vertically up and down in one direction.The soil temperature probe is buried at 0cm on the surface, 2cm and 4cm underground, and 2m to the south of the meteorological tower.The soil moisture sensors are respectively buried 2cm and 4cm underground, in the south due to 2m from the meteorological tower.The soil hot flow plates (3) are successively buried in the ground 6cm away from the weather tower 2m due south.\nRadiation observation projects are: four components (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts per square meter), the surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit: c), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watts per square meter), soil temperature (Ts_0cm Ts_2cm Ts_4cm) (unit: c), soil moisture (Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm) (unit:Volume water content, percentage), up and down photosynthetic effective radiation (PAR_up, PAR_down) (unit: micromole/m s).\nProcessing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;Due to data storage problems, data was missing from September 25 to October 01, 2015;Soil heat flux of 3 and 0cm soil temperature was missing between 6.14-6.22 due to sensor problems.Due to sensor problems, the soil temperature of 0cm occasionally appeared problems between 6.09 and 9.22.Soil heat flux 2 was missing between 10.17 and 10.29 due to sensor problems.(2) eliminate the moments with duplicate records;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the part marked by red letter in the data is the data in question;(5) the format of date and time is uniform, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2015-9-10-10:30;(6) the naming rule is: AWS+ site name.\nPlease refer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al. (2011) for observation data processing.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."
