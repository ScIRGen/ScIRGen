            "description": "Paleozoic strata are well developed and widely outcropped around the Xainza area of central Tibet. Among them, the Devonian succession was first introduced during the geological survey in the late 1970s, and was suggested to comprise the Middle Devonian Dardong Group (including the Lower and Upper formations) and the Upper Devonian Chaguoluoma Formation. However, high-resolution stratigraphic framework and palaeontological research are still lacking for the Lower Devonian in study area. This investigation focus on the Dardong Formation in this area, and detailed geological survey and detailed sampling were carried out in order to improve stratigraphic correlation in central Tibet. The Dardong Formation mainly consists of carbonate and siliciclastic sediments, yielding abundant fossils such as brachiopods, corals, cephalopods, conodonts, tentaculites, etc. The Xainza II section is exposed along the cliff of a mountain. The studied Dardong Formation can be divided into five lithological units in ascending order: 1) light grey to grey medium- to thick-bedded limestone with cross-bedding in the middle part, yielding fragments of brachiopods and crinoid stems; 2) grayish white thin- to medium- bedded siltstone; 3) light grey to grey thin- to medium-bedded limestone, containing colonial corals and crinoid stems; 4) grey medium- to thick-bedded limestone; 5) light grey medium-bedded limestone with fragments of crinoid stems, partially covered in the upper part. This dataset includes the stratigraphic column of the SZ2 section and outcrop photos in the Xainza area, central Tibet.",

                    "Answer": "Geological surveys and systematic sampling are used to collect data in the Devonian stratigraphy of central Tibet by conducting detailed investigations of the Daldong Formation and surrounding areas. This involves mapping the stratigraphic sequences and collecting samples systematically from different rock layers along the SZ2 section. The process includes identifying and categorizing rock types such as carbonates and clastics, and documenting the presence of fossils like brachiopods, corals, crinoids, cephalopods, conodonts, and stromatoporoids. This approach helps in constructing a high-resolution stratigraphic framework and furthering biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic research to enhance the precision of strata correlation in the region.",

                    "Answer": "In regions like central Tibet with a continuous Paleozoic stratigraphic sequence, the geological survey involves a detailed examination of stratotypes and surrounding areas. Systematic sampling should focus on collecting data on carbonate and clastic rock formations rich in fossils like brachiopods, corals, cephalopods, conodonts, and crinoids. The process includes identifying and categorizing rock sequences, such as those in the Dardong Formation, and documenting features like cross-bedding and fossil fragments. Additionally, it requires taking field photographs and creating stratigraphic columns to enhance biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic research accuracy.",
