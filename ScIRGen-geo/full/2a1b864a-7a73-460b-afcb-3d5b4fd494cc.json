            "description": "1) The data include the temperature records reconstructed by using the core depth, age and biomarker gdgts of Bangong Lake to reconstruct the annual average temperature change of Bangong Lake Basin in the west of Qinghai Tibet Plateau since the last deglaciation. At present, most paleoclimate records on the plateau are qualitative and semi quantitative, and the quantitative records are very limited, which restricts the in-depth understanding of the mechanism of climate change on the plateau. Bangongcuo, the largest lake in the west of Qinghai Tibet Plateau, was selected as the study area, and the average annual temperature change in this area since 16 ka BP was reconstructed by using biomarker indexes. 2) The record was reconstructed using gdgts of lake sediments. 3) The data are detailed and reliable. 4) This study not only provides data for understanding the past climate change in the western Qinghai Tibet Plateau, but also provides a basis for discussing the plateau climate change mechanism and verifying the reliability of regional climate model.",

                    "Answer": "Quantitative temperature reconstruction using GDGTs refers to the method of estimating past temperature records by analyzing glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) found in lake sediments. This approach enables researchers to quantitatively assess changes in mean annual temperature over time, as shown in the study of the Bangong Lake region on the western Tibetan Plateau since the Last Deglaciation. It provides detailed and reliable data that enhance understanding of past climate changes and help verify regional climate models.",

                    "Answer": "The use of GDGTs in reconstructing historical temperature records in lake sediments on the Tibetan Plateau is necessitated by the limited availability of quantitative paleoclimate records in the region. This method allows for the reconstruction of annual mean temperature changes since the last deglaciation, providing a more accurate and quantitative insight into past climate variations. This approach is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of climate change on the plateau and validating regional climate models.",

This approach offers a more precise understanding compared to qualitative or semi-quantitative records, aiding in evaluating the reliability of regional climate models.",

This knowledge helps in discussing the mechanisms of climate change on the plateau and serves as a basis for verifying the reliability of regional climate models.",
