            "description": "This is China's high temporal and spatial resolution surface solar radiation data set from 2007-2014. The time resolution is hourly, and the spatial resolution is 5 km. Each hour corresponds to a file named RAD_yyyymmddhh.dat, where yyyy represents the year, mm represents the month, dd represents the day, and hh represents the hour (world time). Longitude (X-axis) grid: 70.025:0.05:140.025, latitude (Y-axis) grid: 59.975:-0.05:14.975. The file is a binary file, in the format of float (real*4), with no header file.\nThere are three steps to acquire this data set: (1) integrating polar-orbiting satellite MODIS and Japanese geostationary meteorological satellite MTSAT data and developing a cloud detection algorithm suitable for MTSAT and an estimation method for MTSAT cloud attribute information (effective particle radius and path water content); (2) developing a broad-band radiation model with cloud attribute, aerosol, water vapor, ozone and other inputs to form an efficient and rapid surface solar radiation inversion technique; and (3) inputting the acquired high-resolution cloud parameter information and other elements such as aerosol, water vapor, and ozone into the broad band radiation transmission model, finally obtaining the high temporal and spatial resolution surface solar radiation data set of China.\nIt has been verified that the instantaneous root mean square error (RMSE) is generally less than 100 W•m-2, and the daily mean root mean square error (RMSE) is generally less than 35 W•m-2.",

                    "Answer": "Errors in high-resolution surface solar radiation data collection can stem from several factors, including the accuracy of cloud detection algorithms used with satellite data, such as those from MODIS and MTSAT. The estimation methods for cloud properties like effective particle radius and path water content can also introduce errors. Additionally, inaccuracies in input data for the broadband radiation model, such as aerosols, water vapor, and ozone, can affect the final results. The validation process reveals that the root mean square error (RMSE) for instantaneous radiation is generally less than 100 W/㎡, and for daily average radiation, it is generally less than 35 W/㎡.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating cloud parameter information from multiple satellite sources, such as MODIS and MTSAT, can enhance the accuracy of solar radiation data by providing more comprehensive and detailed input data for cloud detection and cloud property estimation. This approach allows for the development of a robust cloud detection algorithm and precise estimation of cloud properties, improving the overall accuracy of the derived solar radiation dataset. The development of a broadband radiation model that incorporates cloud attributes, aerosols, water vapor, and ozone information further refines the solar radiation retrieval technique, resulting in a generally lower root mean square error (RMSE), with instantaneous radiation RMSE typically less than 100 W/㎡ and daily average radiation RMSE generally less than 35 W/㎡.",

This aims to enhance understanding and prediction of solar radiation patterns, which can be crucial for various applications such as agricultural planning, solar energy utilization, and climate studies.",
