            "description": "This dataset shows the high-resolution inorganic carbon isotopes of the lower part of the upper Triassic Bolila Bagong formation in Quemocuo area, Qiangtang basin, Qinghai Tibet Plateau（（ δ 13C CARB) and organic carbon isotope（ δ 13 Corg) records and mineralogical data. The samples were collected from the lower part of the upper Triassic Bolila Bagong formation in Quemocuo area, Qiangtang basin. Zircon U-Pb dating was performed by la-mc-icp-ms using the method of Hou Kejun et al. (2009). The results are as follows: the maximum sedimentary age of detrital zircon in calcareous fine sandstone of Bagong formation is 232.5   ± 3     Ma, combined with previous biostratigraphic studies such as ammonoids and bivalves, the stratigraphic age of the Bagong formation is classified as Carnian. In this section, the supply of siliciclastics increased and the contents of calcite and illite decreased sharply, indicating that the paleoclimate changed from drought to warm and humid during CPE. In this section, inorganic carbon isotope（（ δ 13C CARB) and organic carbon isotope（ δ This may be related to the disturbance of global carbon cycle and the release of carbon dioxide rich in 12C. At the beginning of CPE, the degree of negative C isotope bias in Quemocuo area is lighter than that in other areas. During the same period, the eruption of wrangellia igneous province and the release of methane were the main causes δ The most likely reason for the significant negative shift of 13C.",

                    "Answer": "'碳同位素数据' refers to carbon isotope data, which are used to analyze the carbon isotopic composition in rocks or sediments. In geochemical research, this data is typically collected through the analysis of inorganic carbon isotopes (δ13Ccarb) and organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg) from geological samples. These samples are often gathered from specific stratigraphic layers, such as in the Upper Triassic strata, and involve methods like zircon U-Pb dating using techniques such as LA-MC-ICP-MS to help date and understand the paleoclimatic conditions and carbon cycle perturbations.",

This approach is comprehensive and allows for precise chronological constraints, which may differ from other regions where alternative isotopic analysis or dating methods could be used, possibly leading to variations in resolution and accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "The negative shifts in carbon isotope records, both inorganic (δ13Ccarb) and organic (δ13Corg), may suggest disturbances in the global carbon cycle and the release of 12C-rich carbon dioxide. These isotopic shifts, particularly during the Carnian Pluvial Episode (CPE), indicate a transition from arid to warm and humid conditions in the ancient climate. The degree of these negative shifts in the carbon isotopes in the region compared to others might be influenced by the volcanic activity and methane release associated with the Wrangellia large igneous province.",

In the context of the specified field, the negative shifts in inorganic carbon isotopes (δ13Ccarb) and organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg) are potentially linked to the eruption of the Wrangellia large igneous province and the release of methane, which are considered the most likely causes of the significant negative δ13C excursions.",

This can lead to interpretations of climatic transitions, like shifts from arid to warm and humid conditions, and may indicate volcanic activities, such as the Wrangellia large igneous province eruptions, as potential causes of significant δ13C negative deviations.",
