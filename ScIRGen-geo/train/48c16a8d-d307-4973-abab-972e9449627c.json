The data format is tiff, the space-time resolution is 8 days, 0.05°, and the time span is 2002.07-2019.08.\n\nBased on the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) model, PML_V2 is coupled to the GPP process based on stomatal conductance theory. GPP and ET mutually restrict and restrict each other, which makes PML_V2 in ET simulation accuracy, which is greatly improved compared with the previous model. The parameters of PML_V2 are divided into different vegetation types and are determined on 95 vorticity-related flux stations around the world. The parameters were then migrated globally according to the MODIS MCD12Q2.006 IGBP classification. PML_V2 uses GLDAS 2.1 meteorological drive and MODIS leaf area index (LAI), reflectivity (Albedo), emissivity (Emissivity) as inputs, and finally obtains PML_V2 terrestrial evapotranspiration and total primary productivity data sets.",

                "Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of evaporation from the soil, Es, transpiration from the plant canopy, Et, and evaporation of precipitation intercepted by the vegetation, Ei. Among the three components, Et is coupled with carbon assimilation (or gross primary productivity (GPP)), forming the two dominant processes in global water and carbon cycles. Better understanding of these interrelated processes will improve our ability to manage water and carbon resources. ET forms the second largest water flux within the terrestrial hydrological cycle, accounting for about 60–70% of precipitation globally. GPP is produced during photosynthesis and provides a key source of food and energy to sustain the vast majority of life on Earth. Therefore, it is critical to accurately estimate global ET and GPP under climate change and land-cover change. Remote Sensing (RS)-based ET models are dominant for regional and global ET estimations in the past few decades. Among those models, the approaches that combine the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation with remotely-sensed LAI data have been shown to be biophysically robust. The main focus of the PM-based modelling framework is the accurate estimate of the surface conductance (Gs), which describes the canopy-soil conductance to water flux."
