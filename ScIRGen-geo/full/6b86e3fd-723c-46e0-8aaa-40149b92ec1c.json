            "description": "This data set is the concentrations of atmospheric and water POPs in Nam Co, including time series of gas phase OCP, PCBs, PAHs and particulate PAHs in the atmosphere; dissolve and particulate POPs in water. An active air sampler (AAS) was deployed on the roof of Nam Co Monitoring and Research Station for Multisphere Interactions (NCMORS) and the air monitoring was conducted for two consecutive years from September 2012 to September 2014. The flow rate of AAS was 60 L min-1 and the air samples were collected every 2 weeks with a volume of approximately 600 m3 for each sample. The air stream passes first through glass fiber filters (GFFs 0.7 μm, Whatman) to collect the total suspended particulates (TSP) and then through polyurethane foam (PUF, 7.5×6 cm diameter) to retain the POPs in gas phase. Fifteen sites around the Nam Co Lake (surface lake water, 0–1 m depth) were selected to obtain the spatial distribution of POPs in lake water. The water samples (200 L) were filtered with GFFs to obtain the total suspended particulate matter (SPM), and then pumped through an XAD-2 resin column to collect the dissolved phase compounds. All the samples were analyzed at Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The samples were Soxhlet-extracted, purified on an aluminium/silica column (i.d. 8 mm), a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) column subsequently, and were detected on a gas chromatograph with an ion-trap mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Finnigan Trace GC/PolarisQ) operating under MS–MS mode.  A CP-Sil 8CB capillary column (50 m ×0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used for OCPs and PCBs and a DB-5MS column (60 m ×0.25mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used for PAHs. Field blanks and procedural blanks were prepared. The recoveries ranged from 64% to 112% for OCPs, and 65% to 92% forPAHs. The reported concentrations were not corrected for recoveries.",

Each atmospheric sample includes a glass fiber filter membrane for particle-bound POPs and a polyurethane foam for gaseous POPs. Lake water samples are collected from 15 sampling sites around the lake, with each surface water sample taken from a depth of 0-1 m and having a volume of 200 L. The water samples are filtered to obtain total suspended particulates and then enriched for dissolved POPs using XAD-2 filled solid phase extraction columns.",

                    "Answer": "The need for specific sampling and processing techniques arises from the necessity to accurately capture and measure the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in different media such as air and water. This involves using atmospheric active samplers with precise flow rates to collect gaseous and particulate POPs, and employing solid-phase extraction for dissolved POPs in water. The complexity of these methods is due to the low concentration levels of POPs, the variability of environmental conditions, and the requirement for rigorous quality control measures to ensure data reliability and accuracy.",

Lake water samples are collected from 15 surface water sites around the lake, with a water depth of 0-1 m and a sample volume of 200 L each. Water samples are first filtered through 0.7 μm GFF to obtain total suspended particles, then dissolved POPs are enriched using XAD-2 filled solid-phase extraction columns. Sample pretreatment includes Soxhlet extraction, silica-alumina column purification, GPC column to remove large molecular impurities, and concentration. Analysis is conducted using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with chromatographic columns specific for OCPs, PCBs, and PAHs. Quality control includes laboratory and field blanks, with PAHs recovery rates between 65-92% and OCPs recovery rates between 64-112%, with concentrations not corrected for recovery rates.",
