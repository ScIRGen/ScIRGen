            "description": "Mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at a depth of zero annual amplitude and permafrost thermal stability type are fundamental importance for engineering planning and design, ecosystem management in permafrost region. This dataset is produced by integrating remotely sensed freezing degree-days and thawing degree-days, snow cover days, leaf area index, soil bulk density, high-accuracy soil moisture data, and in situ MAGT measurements from 237 boreholes for the 2010s (2005-2015) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) by using an ensemble learning method that employs a support vector regression (SVR) model based on distance-blocked resampling training data with 200 repetitions. Validation of the new permafrost map indicates that it is probably the most accurate of all available maps at present. The RMSE of MAGT is approximately 0.75 °C and the bias is approximately 0.01 °C. This map shows that the total area of permafrost on the TP is approximately 115.02 (105.47-129.59) *104 km2. The areas corresponding to the very stable, stable, semi-stable, transitional, and unstable types are 0.86*104 km2, 9.62*104 km2, 38.45*104 km2, 42.29*104 km2, and 23.80*104 km2, respectively. This new dataset is available for evaluate the permafrost change in the future on the TP as a baseline. More details can be found in Ran et al., (2020) that published at Science China Earth Sciences.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is also called Earth's \"Third Pole\", is the highest and most extensive plateau in the world. The area of high-elevation permafrost on the TP ranks first in the world among middle- and low-latitude permafrost regions, and the permafrost in this region is very sensitive to the increasing warming rate. Significant degradation of permafrost in most sub-regions of the TP has occurred and continues to occur. The presence of permafrost and its changes alter or modify soil hydrothermal and biological processes, thereby affecting ecosystem service functions and water systems. In particular, the degradation of permafrost may affect the stability of infrastructure by reducing the substrate strength and increasing soil permeability, mass movement frequency, thermokarst activity and greenhouse gas fluxes. Existing maps of permafrost/frozen soil on the TP include the China Map of Snow, Ice, and Frozen Ground (1:4000000), the Tibetan Plateau Permafrost Map (1:3000000), the Circum-Arctic Permafrost and Ground-ice Conditions Map (1:10000000), the China Map of Geocryological Regionalization and Classification (1:10000000), the China Map of Glaciers, Frozen Ground and Deserts (1:4000000), and two recently produced permafrost maps that are both derived from a temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model. These maps indicate different levels of understanding of the permafrost distribution in different periods, and both contribute to the improvement of permafrost mapping on the TP. However, from the perspective of current knowledge and data accumulation, these existing permafrost maps have two weaknesses. First, the classification systems used in these maps are based on the areal continuity of permafrost, which is defined by the areal fraction of permafrost, except that the map of Zou et al. (2017) provides only the permafrost extent. This was mainly influenced by the system used in both the former Soviet Union and North America, where high-latitude permafrost zones predominate. However, permafrost at high elevations differs substantially from permafrost at high latitudes. There is an obvious vertical zonation in the distribution of high-elevation permafrost. The vertical projection of so-called \"continuous permafrost\" on a horizontal plane is usually not continuous but isolated. Therefore, the continuity-based system is not suitable for describing high-elevation permafrost. In addition, continuity is a relative term and depends on the map scale. This ambiguous definition of continuity and differences in mapping scale may lead to confusion and inconsistency in the mapped distribution of permafrost. Moreover, traditional permafrost mapping is limited by data scarcity. Global and regional permafrost mapping traditionally relies on in situ air temperature measurement data, but meteorological stations are sparse and unevenly distributed on the TP, with compromised representativeness. Only a few stations are distributed in the permafrost regions. The scarcity of such data is an obstacle for high-resolution permafrost mapping."
