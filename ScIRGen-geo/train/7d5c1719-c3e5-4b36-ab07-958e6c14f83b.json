This dataset was generated based on the temporal correction, spatially downscaling and multi-sensor fusion procedures. Compared with the results from ground flux sites, the long-term trend of this SIF product has a much better performance than current widely-used SIF datasets. This dataset could be beneficial for the estimation of global terrestrial carbon fluxes and for the projection of future climates.\n\nUsing this dataset requires the citation of this paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.10.018).

                "Representing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilated by the terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation gross primary production (GPP) largely drives the inter-annual variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Beer et al. 2010; Forkel et al. 2016) and acts as a key process for mitigating climate warming (Pachauri et al. 2014). Estimations from global carbon budget suggest that more than 30% of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions were fixed by terrestrial ecosystems during the previous century (Friedlingstein et al. 2019). Recent studies have suggested that there are significant increasing trends of global GPP driven by the combined effects from CO2 fertilization, climatic and other environmental drivers (Fernández-Martínez et al. 2019; Friedlingstein et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020a). However, the global spatio-temporal trends of ecosystem GPP still have large uncertainties among various products (Zheng et al. 2020). Therefore, observation-based GPP estimations are needed to reduce the uncertainties of long-term trend in global GPP and also help to improve the future climate projections by assimilating these data into carbon cycle and Earth system models. Currently, the long-term trends of global ecosystem GPP still have large divergences (Anav et al. 2015; Cai et al. 2014; Li et al. 2019a, 2019b; Stocker et al. 2020; Zheng et al. 2020). For example, due to the differential consideration of environmental drivers on vegetation production, the long-term trends of global GPP vary from -0.07 to 0.89 PgC yr-1 among tens of process-based, light-use-efficiency (LUE) and machine learning models (Zheng et al. 2020). Meanwhile, most of current global GPP products exhibited a poor performance in reproducing the interannual variations of GPP (Keenan et al. 2012; Yuan et al. 2014). More importantly, most of current global GPP product were mostly estimated by LUE or process-based models, which depend on multiple key assumptions and parameters (Anav et al. 2015). These limitations highlight the need for better and direct estimations of global ecosystem GPP at a long-term period. The rapidly developed and widely used satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data provide an unprecedented opportunity to more directly monitor the long-term variations of ecosystem GPP at the global scale (Frankenberg et al. 2011; Meroni et al. 2009; Mohammed et al. 2019). Directly link to the vegetation photosynthetic process (Porcar-Castell et al. 2014), SIF has been widely used as the proxy of ecosystem GPP at leaf, canopy and global scales (Guanter et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2017)."

Our temporally corrected and spatially downscaled global long-term SIF product has the potential for the better estimations of global spatial – temporal variations in GPP, and also could be helpful for the improvement in the predictions of future land carbon storage and climate change."
