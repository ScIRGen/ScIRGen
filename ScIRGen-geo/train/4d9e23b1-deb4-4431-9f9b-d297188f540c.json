            "description": "The Engineering Corridors (ECs) in the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (NE-QTP) include sections of highways, railways, and pipelines that are constructed on permafrost terrain, seasonally frozen ground, and loess. Climate change, earthquakes, and human disturbance are accelerating the degradation of permafrost, causing loess failures, and developing slope instability that leads to numerous freeze‒thaw landslides (FTLs), loess landslides (LLs), and general landslides (GLs). These events often result in road cracks and damage to infrastructure. However, few systematic investigations have been carried out, although many landslides have developed along the ECs. To compile a comprehensive landslide inventory, this study utilizes visual interpretation to identify landslides in the high spatial resolution Gaofen-6 images (2 m) taken between 2021 and 2022, covering an area of 30×104 km2. Then, field investigations were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the inventory. We identified 11,914 landslides, including 1,095 FTLs, 7,930 LLs, and 2,889 GLs, while 10,825 of the landslides occurred within a 20 km range of the ECs. More specifically, FTLs are relatively rare and show a zonal distribution along active faults and rivers, whereas LLs and GLs have a dense cluster distribution along rivers. In addition, the mean areas of LLs and GLs are larger than those of FTLs. We observed that landslides are prone to develop on north-facing slopes, with steep slopes for LLs and GLs and gentle slopes for FTLs. Moreover, LLs occurred mainly at lower elevations (1500-2300 m), and GLs occurred at medium elevations (2000-3000 m), while FTLs often developed at high elevations (3000-4000 m). These three types of landslides primarily occur in regions that are predominantly covered with meadows, shrublands, and agricultural vegetation. Our inventory is helpful for in-depth research on landslides in the NE-QTP. It will also provide a significant and valuable dataset for quantifying the analysis of landslides along the ECs that are experiencing climate changes, strong earthquakes, and extensive human activities.",
            "instructions": "File name: The vector file in Shape format contains the boundaries of each landslide.

                    "Answer": "The visual interpretation method using high spatial resolution images (2 meters from Gaofen-6) allows for the identification of landslides over a large area of 30×104 square kilometers, providing a comprehensive landslide inventory. However, field surveys are necessary to assess the accuracy of the visual interpretation, ensuring the reliability of the identified 11914 landslides, including freeze-thaw landslides (FTL), loess landslides (LLs), and general landslides (GLs). While visual interpretation can cover a vast area efficiently, field surveys provide ground-truth data essential for verifying the accuracy of the remote sensing results.",

This suggests that factors such as temperature, precipitation, and ground stability, which vary with altitude, play a role in landslide occurrences. Additionally, the fact that landslides are prevalent in areas covered by grassland, shrubland, and agricultural vegetation indicates that land cover and land use practices may influence slope stability and susceptibility to landslides.",
