            "description": "This data set contains meteorological element observation data of huazhaizi desert station in the middle reaches of heihe hydrological meteorological observation network from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.The station is located in huazhaizi, zhangye city, gansu province.The latitude and longitude of huazhaizi station is 100.3201E, 38.7659N and 1731m above sea level.The observation items include: air temperature and relative humidity sensors at 5m and 10m, facing due north;Install the barometer inside the waterproof box;The tilting bucket rain gauge is installed at 10m;The wind speed and direction sensor is set at 5m and 10m, facing due north;The four-component radiometer is installed at 6m, facing due south;Two infrared thermometers are installed at 6m, facing due south, and the probe facing vertically downward;The soil temperature probe is buried at 0cm of the surface and 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 100cm underground, 2m to the south of the meteorological tower.The soil water sensor is buried 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 100cm underground, 2m to the south of the meteorological tower.The soil hot plates (3 pieces) are buried 6cm underground.Specific observation elements are as follows:\nAir temperature and humidity (Ta_5m RH_5m Ta_10m, RH_10m) (unit: c, percentage), pressure (Press) (unit: hundred mpa), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), wind speed (WS_5m, WS_10m) (unit: m/s), wind (WD_10m) (unit: degrees), the radiation of four component (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts per square meter), the surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit:C), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (in watts/m2), soil moisture (Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm, Ms_10cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_40cm, Ms_60cm, Ms_100cm) (unit: volumetric water content, percentage), and soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_40cm, Ts_60cm, Ts_100cm) (unit: Celsius).\nProcessing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data elements of observation data every day (every 10min), and mark by -6999 in case of data missing;Due to the problem of the wind speed and direction sensor, the observed wind speed of 10m was missing between December and January 29, 2016;The data of soil heat flux G2 was missing from July 5 to August 17 due to the probe problem.(2) excluding the time with duplicate records;(3) data that obviously exceeds the physical significance or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the part marked with red letter in the data is the data in question;(5) date and time have the same format, and date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2016-6-10-10:30;(6) the naming rule is: AWS+ site name.\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Li et al. (2013), and for observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2011).",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
