            "description": "Oases and deserts generally act as a landscape matrix and mosaic in arid/semiarid regions. An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semiarid areas, which is not only the core of its ecological environment but also the foundation of its economic development, especially in western China where has been an important part of the ‘Silk Road’ since ancient times. The particularity of the underlying surface in the oasis-desert area, e.g., the irrigation cropland, riparian forest, sandy vegetation, seasonal snow and frozen soil, makes the study of land‒atmosphere interactions complex and needs comprehensive consideration in such heterogeneous underlying surfaces.\n  The Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest endorheic basin in China, is characterized by artificial oases and natural oases in the middle and lower reaches, respectively. We present a suite of observational datasets in artificial and natural oases-desert systems, which consist of long-term energy, water vapor, carbon/methane fluxes, and auxiliary data involving hydrometeorology, vegetation and soil parameters from 2012 to 2021. Half-hourly turbulent flux data were acquired by an eddy covariance system and scintillometer. The hydrometeorological data, including radiation, soil heat flux and soil temperature profile, gradient of air temperature/humidity and wind speed/direction, air pressure, precipitation and soil moisture profiles, were observed from automatic weather stations with a 10-minute average period as well as the groundwater table data. Moreover, vegetation and soil parameters were also supplemented in the datasets. \nThe up-to-date datasets have been released to scientists, and expected to give a quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor and carbon exchange in oasis-desert areas is crucial for recognizing the oasis-desert interactions and is significant for protecting the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases, and long-term observations are indispensable.",

                "Arid and semiarid regions represent approximately 30 % of the global terrestrial surface area (Dregne, 1991; Scanlon et al., 2006), and dryland expansion occurs under climate change, especially in developing countries (Huang et al., 2016). An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."
