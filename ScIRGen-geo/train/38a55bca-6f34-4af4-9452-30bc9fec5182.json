            "description": "InVEST model, modified general soil erosion equation, photosynthesis equation and other methods are used to evaluate the ecological effects of various major ecological projects implemented in key geographical units of the Tibetan Plateau, including Xizang Autonomous Region, Sanjiangyuan District, Hengduan Mountain Area, etc. The evaluation results of each engineering area indicate that the ecological service function is steadily increasing after the implementation of ecological engineering. The spatial reference system for this data is WGS_ 1984_ UTM_ Zone_ 46N, with a spatial resolution of 1000m. This atlas can be used to illustrate the effectiveness of the ecological security barrier project on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, and also serve as data support for the planning, design, and management of the plateau ecological civilization highland.",
            "instructions": "The name of the file is \"AA_XX_YYYY_YYYY.tif\", where AA stands for the acronym of the region, for example, \"HDS\" stands for Hengduan Mountain, \"SJY\" stands for the source of three rivers, and \"TB\" stands for Xizang. XX represents the types of service functions, such as WC representing water conservation function, SR representing soil conservation function, and CS representing carbon sequestration service function; YYYY_ YYYY represents the start and end years of data evaluation.",
