            "description": "The data set includes ASTER GDEM data and its Mosaic.\nASTER Global DEM (ASTER GDEM) is a Global digital elevation data product jointly released by NASA and Japan's ministry of economy, trade and industry (METI) on June 29, 2009. The DEM data is based on the observation results of NASA's new earth observation satellite TERRA.It is produced by the ASTER(Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radio meter) sensor, which collects 1.3 million stereo image data, covering more than 99% of the earth's land surface.The data has a horizontal accuracy of 30 m (95% confidence) and an elevation accuracy of 7-14 m (95% confidence).This data is the third global elevation data, which is significantly higher than previous SRTM3 DEM and GTOPO30 data.\nWe from NASA's web site (http://wist.echo.nasa.gov/api) to download the data of heihe river basin, and through the data center to distribute.The data distributed by the center completely retains the original appearance of the data without any modification to the data.If users need details about ASTER GDEM preparation process, please refer to the data documents of metadata connections, or visit http://www.ersdac.or.jp/GDEM/E/3.html or directly from https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/ reading and ASTER Global DEM related documents.\nASTER GDEM is divided into several data blocks of 1×1 degree in distribution, and the distribution format is zip compression format. Each compressed file includes three files. The file naming format is as follows:\n          ASTGTM_NxxEyyy_dem.tif\n          ASTGTM_NxxEyyy_num.tif\n          reademe.pdf\n         Where xx is the starting latitude and yyy is the starting longitude._dem. Tif is the dem data file, _num. Tif is the data quality file, and reademe is the data description file.\nIn order to facilitate users to use the data, on the basis of the fractional ASTER GDEM data, we splice fractional SRTM data to prepare the ASTER GDEM Mosaic map of the black river basin, which retains all the original features of ASTER GDEM without any resamulation.   \nThis data includes two files: heihe_aster_gdem_mosaic_dem.img Heihe_Aster_GDEM_Mosaic_num. Img\nThe data is stored in the format of Erdas image, where the file _dem.img is the dem data file and the file _num. Img is the data quality file.",
