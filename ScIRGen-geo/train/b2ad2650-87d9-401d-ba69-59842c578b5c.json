            "description": "Under the summer sunlight, the snow covering the ice melts, forming different shapes and sizes of ice pools on the ice. The melting pool caused by the melting of the sea ice surface will reduce the sea ice albedo, which will have a significant impact on the energy balance in the polar region, increasing absorption and thus accelerating the sea ice melting process. Among the factors that affect the sea ice albedo, melting pool is one of the most important and most violent factors. With climate change, the rate of ice melting in summer is also getting faster and faster. The energy balance on the Earth's surface has a significant impact, and the acceleration of ice melting speed may also make the melting pool, an important natural phenomenon, one of the most significant ice surface features during the Arctic sea ice melting season. The albedo of melting pool is between sea water and sea ice. The study of melting pool on ice is also an important part of the study of the rapid change mechanism of Arctic sea ice. Due to the similar microwave signal characteristics between sea ice melting pools and the sea surface, and the significant uncertainty of using microwave data to map melting pool coverage due to factors such as wind speed and sea ice melting, the most reliable remote sensing method for melting pool coverage is to use medium resolution optical remote sensing data (such as MODIS) to map sub pixel melting pool coverage. This dataset includes the use of MODIS data for sub pixel decomposition inversion of Arctic sea ice melting pool coverage and sea ice concentration based on dynamic end element reflectance. ",
            "instructions": "Data are provided in Geotiff format.\nNaming method: MODIS.Ayyyyddd.MP.tif, where yyyy is the year and ddd is the day of year. The melting pool coverage and sea ice density data in this dataset are retrieved using eight day synthetic spectral reflectance, and the 'do' in the file name is the first day of the eight days.\nEach Geotiff file contains two bands. The first band is the absolute coverage of the sea ice melting pond within the pixel (relative to the pixel area), and the second band is the sea ice concentration (the sum of exposed sea ice or snow covered sea ice and the melting pool area, as a proportion of the pixel area).\nThe original resolution of this data is 500 meters. In order to reduce the amount of data, this dataset has been aggregated at a 3km resolution.\nPixel value of 0-100 is the valid pixel value for melt pond fraction and sea ice concentration. 101 is the ice sheet, 102 is the pixels of land, pixel value of 255 indicates the pixels not included in the retrieval (including the cloud pixels).\nThe reference paper of this dataset: C.

                "The Arctic has experienced extensive sea ice retreat in recent decades, as observed from satellite remote sensing and simulated by general circulation models. The significant low albedo of melt pond compared with snow and ice results in more absorption of radiation compared with sea ice without melt pond, which will then enhance sea ice melt to form more melt pond. This so-called positive feedback of melt pond is crucial for sea ice thermal and physical properties. The sea ice is important for the Earth climate system because of its function in Earth energy balance. The quantification of melt pond coverage is important for the energy balance and climate change studies of the Earth. Recent studies show that the considering of melt pond in sea ice model can improve the prediction skill of sea ice models. Satellite derived melt pond cover fraction also served as calibration and validation dataset for sea ice process models. The assimilation of satellite derived melt pond cover fraction in sea ice model also has the potential to improve the sea ice modeling. These studies indicate that the melt pond related process is important in the ocean and sea ice system."

Atmospheric corrected MODIS Surface Reflectance 8-Day L3 version 6 (MOD09A1) is used to estimate the MPF in this study. The spatial resolution of the MOD09A1 product is 500 m, and the temporal resolution is 8 days. In the MPF estimation algorithm developed in this study, linear pixel unmixing algorithm is used such as used in many studies, but with dynamic endmember reflectance. A special index and melt pond depth are used to describe the melt pond reflectance, and then look up table (LUT) is constructed in the MPF estimation algorithm when searching for optimized spectral reflectance. Then, 22-year Pan-Arctic MPF is produced using the newly develop algorithm and the spatial – temporal characteristics of MPF in Arctic is analyzed and discussed."
