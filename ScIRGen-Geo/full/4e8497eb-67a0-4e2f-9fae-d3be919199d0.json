      "description": "The 0.25 Degree climate data set in the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau from 1957 to 2009 contains four meteorological elements, which are precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and wind speed. The time resolution is daily.\nThe data set contains 2400 text files, each with precipitation (the 1st column), highest (the 2nd column) and lowest (the 3rd column) temperatures and wind speed (the 4th column). Each file name contains latitude and longitude. Each file represents the four meteorological element values for the corresponding grid point (0.25*0.25 degrees).\nThese data are formed by gridding the observation data of 81 meteorological stations in the northeast of the plateau, considering the change of meteorological conditions with the elevation.\nThe gridding methods and steps are as follows.\nDownload the original daily maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, and wind speed from the China Meteorological Data Network (http://data.cma.cn). Then, perform quality control on the data. The principle used is 1) to remove daily precipitations below 0 and greater than 150 mm, daily temperatures below -50 °C and greater than 50 °C and wind speeds below 0 m / s, 2) draw annual sequence precipitation, temperature and wind speed, check for abnormal year-to-year changes, and conduct quality control through station migration records. For data with abnormal changes but with station migration records, the data are segmented by modifying the station name. For example, at Xining Station (52866), abnormal temperature changes occurred in 1996, which was found through records that Xining Station migrated after 1996. Therefore, the records before 1996 are recorded as virtual station 52867 data, and after 1996, the data are still recorded as 52866 stations. If the data change abnormally but there is no station migration record, the abnormally changed data are eliminated, for example, the data from Delingha Station before 1975. Some stations have migration records, but the data do not change abnormally; then, it is assumed that the stations before and after the migration are still in the same climate environment, so there is no change in station name and data record.\n   Interpolation begins after quality control. The method begins with (1) calculating the changes in daily average temperature, precipitation and wind speed as the altitude changes. It is concluded that the temperature decreases with altitude by 4.3 °C/km, and the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.65. In the warm and humid season (from May to September), the average daily precipitation has an insignificant increase with altitude (0.5 mm/km, R2 is 0.1). The average daily precipitation in the cold dry season (from October to April) does not change with altitude. The wind speed also has an insignificant increase with altitude, with an increase rate of 0.4 m/s/km and R2 of 0.1. (2) The spatial interpolation is performed using the Synographic Mapping System (SYMAP, Shepard, 1984) method. In this method, the distance between stations and the angle between surrounding stations are taken into account in interpolation to indicate the density of stations. The distance and angle are integrated into a weight. In addition, the stations that are close and have a large angle between each other are given a large weight. (3) The latitude and longitude of the station, the meteorological element value, the altitude, the rate of change with the altitude, and the weight are considered simultaneously, and the value of the target grid is interpolated. The maximum search range for interpolation is 55 stations around, and the smallest search range is 4 stations around. (4) Integrate the precipitation in the warm and dry seasons to form a precipitation sequence throughout the period. (5) During the method test period, some stations are set aside to check the gridded data. (6) After the verification is passed, all 81 stations are used in the final gridding process and form this set of data sets.\n  Shepard, D.

      "descriptionCn": "青藏高原东北部1957-2009年0.25度气候数据集，包含降水、最高和最低气温、风速四个气象要素值，时间分辨率为逐日。\n数据集包含2400个文本文件，每个文件里有降水（第一列）、最高（第二列）和最低（第三列）气温、风速（第四列）。每个文件名含有经纬度，每个文件代表相应网格点（0.25*0.25度）的四个气象要素值。\n本数据是由高原东北部81个气象站观测资料网格化形成。考虑了气象条件随高程的变化。\n网格化方法和步骤如下：\n从气象局数据共享网（http://data.cma.cn）下载原始的逐日最高和最低气温、降水、风速。之后对数据进行质量控制。所用的原则为1)去除小于0，大于150mm逐日降水；小于-50°C，大于50°C逐日气温；小于0m/s风速；2）画出年序列降水、气温和风速，检查不正常的逐年变化，并通过台站迁移记录进行质量控制。对有非正常变化，但有台站迁移记录的数据，通过修改台站名称，对数据进行分段，如西宁站（52866）1996年出现不正常气温变化，通过记录发现西宁站在1996年后迁移，因此将1996年前的记录记为虚拟台站52867数据，1996年之后的仍记录为52866站的数据。如果数据出现异常变化，但没有台站迁移记录，则将异常变化的数据剔除，如1975年之前的德令哈站数据。有些台站有迁移记录，但数据没有异常变化，即假定迁移前后的台站仍处于相同的气候环境下，因此台站名称和数据记录没有任何改变。\n质量控制后开始内插，其方法为1）计算日平均气温、降水和风速随海拔高度的变化。得出气温随海拔高度递减率为4.3°C/km,其决定系数R2为0.65。暖湿季（5-9月）逐日平均降水量随海拔高度有一个不显著的增加（0.5mm/km，R2为0.1）。冷干季（10-4月）逐日平均降水量不随海拔变化。风速也随海拔高度有一个不显著的增加，其增加率为0.4m/s/km，R2为0.1。气温和风速随海拔的变化率用在整个时间段里，而降水随海拔递增率只用在暖湿季，冷干季递增率为0。2）空间内插时利用Synographic Mapping System (SYMAP,Shepard, 1984)方法。这个方法在内插时考虑台站之间的距离以及周围台站之间的角度以表示台站的密集程度。将距离和角度综合为一个权重，用在内插中。距离近且台站之间的夹角大的台站赋予大权重。3）将台站的经纬度、气象要素值、海拔、随海拔的变化率和权重同时考虑，内插出目标网格的值。内插时最大的搜索范围为周围55个台站，最小的搜索范围为周围4个台站。4）综合暖湿和冷干季节的降水，形成整个时段的降水序列。5）在方法测试期，留出了部分台站以检查网格化后的数据。6）验证通过后，所有的81个台站均用在最终网格化过程，并形成本套数据集。\nShepard, D.

        "The Yellow River, considered the cradle of Chinese civilization, originates in northern Tibetan Plateau (TP), flows through the Loess Plateau and the North China Plain, eventually empties into the Bohai Sea to the east of China. The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) above the Tang Nai Hai (TNH) hydrometric station contributes approximately 35% of the total annual discharge in disproportion to its 15% area of the entire Yellow River Basin (Hu et al., 2011). Understanding UYRB hydrological processes, especially in the context of global climate change and increased human activity, is necessary for informed current and future sustainable management of its water resources. A number of observational studies have shown that streamflow measured at TNH decreased over the past decades (Cao et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2011). Like elsewhere on Earth, climate change is taking place in the Yellow River Basin as reported by Wang et al. (2001), Fu et al. (2004), Yang et al. (2004), Xu et al. (2007), Zhao et al. (2007), Tang et al. (2008), Zhang et al. (2008) and Hu et al. (2011). These studies consistently describe basin-wide temperature increases, tempo-spatial variations in precipitation changes, and decreases in water resources in the Yellow River Basin."

        "This study, by applying a rigorously calibrated and validated physically-based macroscale hydrological model over the UYRB, aims to identify changes in observed streamflow at several locations and to explore the causes of streamflow changes by examining climate change impacts on water balance terms, and land cover/use change (both long term and recent human intervention) impacts on streamflow. The ultimate objective of this study is to identify the mechanisms that are responsible for streamflow changes in the UYRB."

      "challenges": [
        "Most of these studies focused on the revelation of the changes based on the correlation analysis between streamflow and temperature/precipitation, whereas the mechanisms that link climate change to streamflow change were rarely explored. Also, few studies examined streamflow changes at hydrometric stations other than TNH in the UYRB and it is unclear whether or not their findings are applicable to the entire UYRB. What are lacking in these studies are in-depth analyses and the quantification of the changes in water balance terms related to climate change."
