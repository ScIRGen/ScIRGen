            "description": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS elemental geochemical analysis and tims SR Nd isotopic composition show that the main lithology of the Mishuling intrusion is quartz monzonite, while the dark enclave is diorite. Zircon U-Pb geochronology shows that the dark enclaves and the host rocks were formed at the same time. Compared with dark enclaves, quartz monzonite has low Mg value, low Cr and Ni contents and high Th / u ratio. The quartz monzonite originated from the partial melting of Neoproterozoic basic rocks in the northwestern margin of the Yangtze Landmass, and the dark inclusions were formed by the mixing of magma from partial melting of enriched mantle and acidic magma from partial melting of crust. Zircons from dark enclaves and host rocks have different geochemical characteristics, which can be divided into three types and record complex magma mixing process. The data comes from the scientific research project \"deep process and resource effect of major geological events in Yanshanian period\" (2016YFC0600404), a national key research and development plan.",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating analysis refers to a technique used in geochemical research to determine the age of zircon minerals by using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). This method involves ablating a small part of the zircon sample with a laser and analyzing the isotopic ratios of elements, such as uranium and lead, to calculate the age of the zircon crystals. It is commonly used to understand the timing of geological events.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF, and ICP-MS geochemical analysis with TIMS Sr-Nd isotopic composition can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the geological history and processes of Triassic rock formations. Such integration may reveal insights into age determination, elemental composition, and isotopic characteristics, which could provide evidence for complex magmatic processes, such as the interaction between mantle-derived and crustal-derived magmas. This comprehensive dataset allows for distinguishing between different types of rock bodies and understanding their formation mechanisms, such as partial melting and magma mixing, which in turn can affect interpretations of tectonic settings and resource potential in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The instrumental techniques and procedural steps include LA-ICP-MS for zircon U-Pb dating, XRF and ICP-MS for elemental geochemical analysis, and TIMS for Sr-Nd isotopic composition determination. These methods are used to analyze the quartz monzonite of the Maishuling pluton and the dioritic characteristics of the mafic enclaves, revealing simultaneous formation and complex magmatic mixing processes.",
