The S-wave velocity structure under the station is obtained by using the joint inversion of the P-wave receiver function and the group velocity dispersion of 42 stations located near the Dahutang mining area in Jiangxi Province. The dataset contains 42 files in the format of DAT: for example, dahutang.jx46.velocity.dat. The data set represents the lithospheric velocity structure of the Dahutang mining area and understands the deep mechanism of Dahutang polymetallic mineralization.",
            "instructions": "Data naming: the S-wave velocity structure is stored in text format, and the name of the file is \"Dahutang.stnm.velocity.dat\", where \"stnm\" represents the station name, such as Dahutang.JX01.velocity.dat Represents the S-wave velocity structure obtained by joint inversion of station JX01.\nData reading mode: all ASCII files in the data set can be directly opened using text editing software. \nThe main contents: the first column station name, the second column station latitude (degree), the third column station longitude (degree), the fourth column depth (km), and the fifth column S-wave velocity (km/s).",
