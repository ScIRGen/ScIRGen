            "description": "The spot satellite series in France consists of five stars, of which spot 5 is the best. It was launched in May 2002, with a height of 830km, an orbit inclination of 98.7 degrees, and a sun synchronous quasi regression orbit, with a regression period of 26 days. Linear array sensor (CCD) and push scan scanning technology were used for imaging. SPOT5 satellite carries two high-resolution geometric imagers (HRG), one high-resolution Stereo Imager (HRS) and one wide field vegetation detector (VGT). It has five working bands, multi spectral band spatial resolution is 10m (short wave infrared spatial resolution is 20m), panchromatic band spatial resolution is 2.5m. \nAt present, there are three spots of SPOT5 data in Heihe River Basin. The coverage and acquisition time are respectively: 1 scene in Linze area, including multispectral image with resolution of 10m and panchromatic image with resolution of 2.5m, with time of 2008-07-04; 1 scene in Zhangye City, with resolution of 2.5m, with time of 2008-03-29; 1 scene of multispectral data with resolution of 10m, with time of 2008-08-10. \nThe product level is L1, and the product has undergone rough geometric correction. \nSPOT5 image is mainly used as the base map of geometric precision correction in Heihe experiment. \nThe spot 5 remote sensing data set of Heihe comprehensive remote sensing joint experiment was purchased by Beijing Normal University.",
