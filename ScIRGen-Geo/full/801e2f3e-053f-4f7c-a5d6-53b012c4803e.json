            "description": "This dataset contains stable isotopes of runoff from the mainstream in the Three River Headwaters Region, with water samples collected during the melting period. The data were measured by the laboratory of Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using LGR liquid water isotope analyzer. The stable isotope ratio is expressed as the thousandth difference relative to Vienna's Standard Mean Sea Water (VSMOW). The original data has been corrected by laboratory professionals and is reliable. This dataset can be used for quantitative research on water cycle and evolution laws, water quality, hydrological processes, etc. It is of great significance for the scientific management and sustainable development of regional water resources.",

                "Cryospheric meltwater is an important runoff component and it profoundly influences changes in water resources in the Tibetan Plateau. Known as the ‘‘Chinese water tower,” the Three-River Headwater Region (TRHR)—the source water for Yellow (YLR), Yangtze (YZR), and Lancangjiang (LCR) rivers—supports 700 million people in the downstream areas, as it ensures food, energy, and water security. Under climate warming, the TRHR over the eastern Tibetan Plateau has experienced significant hydrological changes during the past few decades. Furthermore, annual streamflow has shown a significant upward trend over the past 50 years, with precipitation playing the most important role. Due to the lack of data and the difficulty of observation and sampling in cold regions, current studies have paid more attention to the study of hydrological processes and water cycle characteristics at the watershed scale from a macroscopic point of view. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies on the mechanisms underpinning the temporal and spatial variations in runoff components from a microscopic point of view, with studies of the hydrological effects still at the exploratory stage."
