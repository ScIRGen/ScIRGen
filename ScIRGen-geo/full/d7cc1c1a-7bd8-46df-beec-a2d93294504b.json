            "description": "The dataset of airborne Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometers (PLMR) was acquired on 5 July, 2012, located in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The aircraft took off at 10:50 am (UTC+8) from Zhangye airport and landed at 12:20 pm, with the flight time of 1.5 hours. The flight was performed in the altitude of about 2000 m and at the speed of about 220-250 km during the observation, corresponding to an expected ground resolution of about 600 m. \nThe PLMR instrument flown on a small aircraft operates at 1.413 GHz (L-band), with both H- and V-polarizations at incidence angles of ±7.5°, ±21.5° and ±38.5°. PLMR ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ calibrations were performed before and after each flight. The processed PLMR data include 2 DAT files (v-pol and h-pol separately) and 1 KMZ file for each flying day. The DAT file contains all the TB values together with their corresponding beam ID, incidence angle, location, time stamp (in UTC) and other flight attitude information as per headings. The KMZ file shows the gridded 1-km TB values corrected to 38.5 degrees together with flight lines. Cautions should be taken when using these data, as the RFI contaminations are often higher than expected at v-polarization.",

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."

This interference affects the V polarization TB values more strongly than the H polarization, which could lead to inaccuracies in data collection. Additionally, the resolution of 600 meters might not capture fine-scale heterogeneity effectively in some landscapes.",

These are supported by eco-hydrological sensor networks and intensive airborne remote sensing missions to capture data at various scales.",
