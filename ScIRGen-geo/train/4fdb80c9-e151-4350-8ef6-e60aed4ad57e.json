                    "Answer": "The identification of 75 plasma membrane-associated RNAs using APEX-seq suggests that this method is effective in pinpointing specific RNAs linked to subcellular structures, such as the plasma membrane. It showcases the potential of APEX-seq to provide detailed insights into RNA localization and interactions at a cellular level. However, potential limitations could include the method's sensitivity to capturing only certain types of RNAs, possible biases introduced during RNA library preparation, and the challenge of ensuring specificity in labeling subcellular regions. The reliance on high-quality sequencing and rigorous data preprocessing also highlights the need for stringent quality control measures to obtain accurate results.",
