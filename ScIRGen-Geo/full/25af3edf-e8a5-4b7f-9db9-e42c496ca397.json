                "Soil erosion is a worldwide issue that may lead to a number of problems, such as degraded soil productivity, poor water quality, decreased reservoir storage capacity, and disturbance of aquatic life. In high mountain regions, soil erosion is particularly susceptible to the impacts of changing climate, and research can provide a valuable understanding of hydrological and ecological responses to climate change. The Tibetan Plateau, also known as “the Third Pole,” is one of the most fragile environmental zones in Asia and is vulnerable to soil erosion. Major rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau support billions of people in the surrounding areas and also generate ~ 25% of the global sediment load to nearby oceans. The Yarlung Tsangpo River flows from west to east across the southern region of the Tibetan Plateau, and its midstream serves as the political, economic, and cultural center in Tibet, which has a developed economy and large population. Soil erosion is a phenomenon derived from the denudation and transportation of soil particles and is greatly intensified by human activities, such as excessive deforestation and the conversion of grassland or forests to farmland or infrastructure construction. Erosion is a complicated process influenced by the climate condition, soil properties, topographical factors, land cover, and the interactions between these factors. Quantitative models have been developed to calculate soil erosion. These models are classified as physically based and empirical types. Among these models, USLE is the most important and widely used. The USLE was established by Wischmeier and Smith (1978) and was developed based on thousands of experiments conducted by the Soil Conservation Service and the Agricultural Research Service in 37 US states. With the accumulation of data and increased understanding of soil erosion, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was developed to improve the applicability of the model, which had modifications for slope length, slope factors, and climate factors, as well as a new method for computing vegetation cover factors."

Increasing precipitation and temperature would lead to increasing soil erosion risk in ~ 2050 based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and RUSLE models."

MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Land Cover Product (MCD12Q1), and Vegetation Indices (MOD13A3) were used to evaluate the impact of soil preservation practices and vegetation conditions on soil erosion. The China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) provided precipitation and temperature data for estimating the climate’s effect on erosion. In this study, the RUSLE was applied. The rainfall runoff erosivity was calculated. The snowmelt runoff erosivity without gully erosion caused by snowmelt runoff can be described. The snowmelt runoff erosivity of these 3 years in the three sub-basins were estimated using Eqs. (3 –10). The soil erodibility factor (K) indicates the susceptibility of soil to erosion under unit plot conditions. The slope length is calculated from where water begins to flow to where sedimentation starts. The steepness is the average slope gradient of the terrain and is conveyed as a percentage of the vertical height over a horizontal distance. The MODIS NDVI data were used to calculate the C factor through the following equation. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) climate model was used to obtain future climatic factors for ~2050. The final calculation of soil erosion for ~2050 was derived with predicted R, K, C, LS, and P factors following Eq. (1)."
