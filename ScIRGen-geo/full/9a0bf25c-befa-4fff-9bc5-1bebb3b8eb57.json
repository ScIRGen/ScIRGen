            "description": "Through the semi-quantitative collection method, benthos research was carried out in 22 lakes in the core area of Qiangtang and Yamzho Lake in the summer of 2020. The relative abundance data of Zoobenthos in alpine lakes in Tibet were obtained by the mixed sampling of littoral and deep-water communities. The results of this data show that among the 6420 selected benthos, 28 species of benthos are identified, belonging to 3 phyla and 7 classes, of which the main benthic groups are gammarus and chironomid, and the dominant species in a few lakes are water beetles. This data improves the recognition accuracy and cognitive range of Zoobenthos in Tibet and will provide a reference for the evaluation of aquatic animal diversity and fishery resources in plateau lakes.",
            "instructions": "File naming: the benthic data is stored in Excel format. The name of the file is \"step_2020_lake benthos_%\", in which the abscissa is the species name and the ordinate is the lake name.\nData reading method: the data can be opened, read and used directly with office software.",
