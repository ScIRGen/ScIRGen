            "description": "Human adaptation to high altitude environment (> 2500m) is an important milestone in the process of human evolution and diffusion. As the highest altitude and largest plateau in the world, the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is an ideal area for human adaptation to extreme hypoxia environment. An early site with continuous strata, the site of jijunbu, was newly discovered on the Bank of Zhuanglang River in Yongdeng County, Gansu Province, northeast of Qinghai Tibet Plateau. A series of samples were taken from the site in 2015 and 2018. The results of photoluminescence dating show that the age of the site is 120-90 Ka, which is the earliest wilderness site on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, providing new clues for the study of early human activity history and survival adaptation on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The early dating of an archaeological site in a high-altitude environment, such as the one in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, suggests that researchers need to employ precise dating techniques like optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to determine the age of human activity accurately. This further implies the necessity of understanding and refining data collection methods that can withstand challenging environments with extreme conditions, thereby improving interpretations of human adaptation and survival strategies.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of optical luminescence dating as a method for determining the age of early human habitation sites in high-altitude environments like the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is influenced by its ability to provide accurate age estimates over a wide range of time scales. Specifically, for the Jiǎngjùn Bù site, this method was chosen due to its effectiveness in dating sediments in sequences with continuous stratigraphy, which is essential for establishing a chronological framework of early human activities and adaptations in this extreme environment over 120-90 ka.",
