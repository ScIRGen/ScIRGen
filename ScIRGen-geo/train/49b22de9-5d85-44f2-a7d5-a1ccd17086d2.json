                "Soil moisture (SM) plays a key role in land–atmosphere interactions through its strong impacts on the water and carbon cycle. The status of SM is closely related to climate and weather conditions. The high-quality SM data with a fine spatial–temporal scale can be valued as indispensable tools for observing extreme weather events, e.g., droughts, floods, and carbon cycle modeling. Further, SM is also identified as an important component of the Essential Climate Variables by the Global Observing System for Climate. However, high-quality SM data acquisition is a challenging task due to the complicated spatiotemporal variations of the SM. Such spatiotemporal variations of SM are usually affected by the inherent heterogeneity of soils, land cover, and weather. At present, the methods for SM data estimation can be divided into five categories: in situ observations, satellite observations, offline land surface model simulations, Earth system model simulations, and reanalysis products. For in situ SM observations, SM data are usually measured by the probe measurement method, in which as direct observations this method usually leads to lower errors than satellite observations, land surface model simulations, Earth system model simulations, and reanalysis products. Although a large number of stations are distributed all over the world, there are still many regions with no in situ SM observations due to financial constraints, and field stations are too sparse to capture adequate spatial coverage. For satellite observations, SM data are mainly retrieved by microwave radiometers on satellites, which can provide the global SM data with uniform distributions, but for the microwave-radiometer-measured SM data from the near surface, only the top-layer SM can be retrieved and the data gaps exist in regions with dense vegetation and snow-covered or frozen soils. The SM data of the offline land surface model and Earth system model simulations span multiple soil layers and have a seamless spatial distribution, but they both have uncertain and different forcing factors due to the spatial sub-grid heterogeneity of soil properties and vegetation, thus leading to large differences from in situ SM observations. Reanalysis products can also provide SM data with good temporal variations by assimilating observations into land surface models or Earth system models. They can also provide SM data at deeper soil depth than satellite observations, but reanalysis products usually lead to higher disagreement with in situ SM observations when the assimilated meteorological variables are biased. In brief, the characteristic strong points and shortcomings both coexist in each type of SM product."
