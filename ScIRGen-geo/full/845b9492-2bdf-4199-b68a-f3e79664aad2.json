            "description": "The dataset of spectral reflectance observations of the Picea crassifolia was obtained at the super site around the Dayekou Guantan forest station. Six measurements were carried out altogether, including three outdoors and three indoors.\n     (1) Outdoor multiangle (-60°, -50°, -40°, -30°, -20°, -0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, 50° and 60°) and four-component (the sunshine and the shaded canopy, the sunshine and the shaded land) spectrum of Qinghai spruce was measured by ASD, FieldSpec Pro and the observation platform (of BNU make) on Jun. 10 and 11, 2008. Optical fibres of 1m and 10m were used as required. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) Indoor observations by the integrating sphere,  Li－Cor 1800-12s (BNU), ASD and FieldSpec Pro were carried out on Jun. 5, 0 and 10, 2008. They were mainly for trees of different ages, reflectance of Qinghai spruce bark, and reflectance and transmission. The data can only be opened by ASD ViewSpecPro; the processed spreadsheet file can be opened by Microsoft Excel.\n     (3) Vertical ground object (scrub, meadow, moss, the shaded moss, litter, the bare land, Qinghai spruce of different ages) spectrum was measured by ASD and FieldSpec Pro on Jun. 4, 2008. Optical fibres of 1m and 10m were used as required.",

                "Land surface albedo is a very important parameter, which can be derived from a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model with angular integration of BRDF in a particular distribution of downward solar irradiance. The Algorithm for MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Anisotropic of Land Surface (AMBRALS) utilizes a kernel-driven BRDF model to retrieve land surface albedo, but it does not take into account the topographic effect. Land surface albedo frequently served as an indicator to quantify how much energy the Earth receives from the sun. The Algorithm for MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Anisotropic of Land Surface (AMBRALS) is an algorithm designed for land surface albedo retrieval using NASA’s MODIS data. This algorithm has been widely accepted, but it cannot deal with topographic effect, which leads to large uncertainties in albedo retrieval over rugged terrain. The topography plays different roles in the retrieval of land surface albedo at different spatial scales. At high spatial resolution, topography results in multiscattering among pixels and varies the downward solar irradiance. At low spatial resolution, topography leads to multiscattering and obscuration within pixel. In a 30 m grid, the topography modifies the solar reflecting geometry and influences land surface albedo in several ways: 1) varying the downward direct solar radiance; 2) affecting downward diffuse radiance; and 3) modifying the reflected radiance due to non-flat surface."

To overcome this shortage, we attempt to introduce a topographic factor into the AMBRALS to deal with topographic effect. A hypothesis is made that a digital elevation model (DEM) with horizontal resolution of 30 m could fully capture the topographic characteristics."
