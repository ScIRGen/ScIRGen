            "description": "The data set includes the estimated data of the SOS (start of season) and the EOS (end of season) of vegetation in Sanjiangyuan based on 10-day synthetic NDVI products from the SPOT satellite. Two common phenological estimation methods were adopted: the threshold extraction method based on polynomial fitting (the term “poly” was included in the file names) and the inflection point extraction method based on double logistic function fitting (the term “sig” was included in the file names). These data can be used to analyse the relationship between vegetation phenology and climate change. The temporal coverage is from 1999 to 2013, and the spatial resolution is 1 km.",
