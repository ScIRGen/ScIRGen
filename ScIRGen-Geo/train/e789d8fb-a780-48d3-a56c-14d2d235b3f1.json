Multi-sensory   data is used to retrieve the  the kernel-driven BRDF model and coupled with  topographic effects, and  prior knowledge is introduced for quality control inversion. The high-precision BRDF  of good spatial-temporal continiuty  is retrieved by combining MODIS reflectance data (a polar orbiting satellite) and  himawari-8 AHI  land surface reflectance (a geostationary satellite ). MODIS lans surface reflectance data and AHI TOA reflectance data are downloaded from the official websites. After registration, atmospheric correction and other processing, the daily resolution BRDF is synthesized with a period of 5 days.  Compared with similar products, it has more advantages in capturing rapidly changing surface features, and has better temporal and spatial continuity with the shortest composition period. It can effectively support angular effects correction and  the BRDF-releated parameters' retrieval.",

                "Rugged terrain covers approximately 24% of the Earth’s land surface, plays an important role in the complex earth system, and forms a unique mountainous climate and ecosystem. Accurately estimating land surface variables over mountainous areas is of great importance for global hydrological and meteorological forecasts, as well as global ecological and environmental monitoring. Remote sensing of anisotropic reflectance relates the land surface scattering behavior to its optics and structure, which is described with the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and can be observed in optical remote sensing. To retrieve BRDF properties of the land surface is the basis for land surface’s physical parameter inversions due to its structural information observed from different angles. However, rugged terrain complicates BRDF modeling by changing the amount of radiation detected by the sensor. Generally, topography alters the illumination and viewing geometry and generates a relief shadow, observation masking, and multiple scattering, this results in the intense topographic dependence on total incident and reflectance radiance, which distorts BRDF characteristics. Without considering the topographic effects on the land surface BRDF, the anisotropic reflectance estimation relative errors could be larger than 58%.",
                "In the past decades, physical solo slope BRDF models have been proposed to account for the topographic effects on pixel reflectance. These are the BRDF models based on radiative transfer, geometric-optical, and hybrid methods. Since vegetation cover, such as forest and grassland, dominates the complex mountainous land ecosystem, current physical solo slope BRDF models mainly focus on the vegetation. The importance of the topographic effect in the radiative transfer was first proposed by Combal et al. who successfully extended the Ross radiative transfer theory for flat plant canopies to solo slope with a vertical plant stand. The topographic effect on local geometry relationship has been considered in the ROSST model through the transformation between horizontal and slope coordinate systems. The geotropic nature of tree crowns was accounted for by using the leaf structural and the optical characteristics defined in the horizontal coordinate to solving the one-dimensional (1-D) analytical radiative transfer equation. However, only the direct solar radiation was considered, the effect of diffuse skylight, path radiance, and diffuse irradiance from adjacent slopes are neglected. Recently, the topographic effect on the bidirectional gap probability has been regarded as the primarily factor affecting canopy reflectance. A physical solo slope canopy reflectance model based on the path length correction (PLC) was proposed to account for the topographic effect on the canopy photon path length and its BRDF. The geometry correction, geotropic nature of the tree crown, and the diffuse skylight are coupled in this model. However, the diffuse irradiance from neighboring terrains is still neglected.",
                "The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model over rugged terrain needs to be coupled with terrain information supplied by a digital elevation model (DEM) to accurately describe topographic effects and radiation redistribution. BRDF is a theoretical concept defined as the ratio of two infinitesimal surfaces and cannot be directly measured, so the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is used as a substitute to describe surface anisotropic scattering properties. Many efforts have been devoted to investigating the topographic effects on surface BRDF, which is crucial to understanding the basic theory and scientific problems involved with BRDF over rugged terrain. Solo slope and composite slope surfaces have different topographic effect mechanisms in the BRDF, leading to different core sensitivity factors considered in remote sensing BRDF modeling. The topographic effects on the solo slope BRDF depend on the slope and aspect angle, and the structural and optical properties of the vegetation."

                "In this paper, remote sensing BRDF modeling over rugged terrain according to the presented research chain is comprehensively reviewed, and the aim is to find an operational BRDF product potential solution for rugged terrain. This is important for quantitative remote sensing applications in mountainous areas."
            ],
            "challenges": [
                "However, on rugged terrain, the topography intensely affects the shape and magnitude of the BRDF and creates challenges in modeling the BRDF. However, the operational BRDF product algorithm over rugged terrain is still being researched because it involves a complex process, which includes multi-angular reflectance dataset processing, an operational BRDF algorithm and its inversion method coupled with topography.",
                "However, the rotational geometric correction leads to crown inclination. This contradicts with the geotropic nature of tree crowns where the trees grow vertically and orient with the gravitational field, regardless of the slope. The crown structural and optical properties over the solo slope remain the same as those on the flat surface. For example, the leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf reflectance and transmittance reflectance are not affected by the terrain. However, for the discrete forest stands, the crown shadowing projections on the background are influenced by the geotropic nature of tree crowns. The geometry correction using Equation (9) without negative geotropism consideration will lead to an incorrect crown shadowing, as well as an inappropriate canopy reflectance. However, the tree crowns are virtually inclined after the geometric correction. The importance of the geotropic nature of tree crowns has been stressed in the topographic correction of forested terrain. Another topographic effect on the canopy reflectance is through the redistribution of surface global incident solar radiation, which modifies the upper boundary condition during the radiative transfer process. When compared to the flat terrain, the topography redistributes the direct solar irradiance by changing the surface’s local illumination and viewing geometry. The terrain restricts the diffuse skylight and enhances the diffuse irradiance that is reflected from adjacent slopes. The last two diffuse components can account for 40% of the global radiation of a sunlit slope when the solar zenith angle is high, and this can even approach 100% when the slope is obstructed by adjacent terrains. Moreover, varied elevation will induce rapid changes in concentrations of aerosol, water vapor, and cloud properties, which give rise to significant variations in the amount of direct and diffuse incident irradiance.",
                "The largest difference between topographic effects for solo slope and composite slope lies in complex heterogeneous incident irradiance and topographic shadowing. The mountain radiation transfer prototype model, based on Lambertian land surface assumptions, often leads to an overcorrected reflectance. Recent literature shows that without considering the surface BRDF effects in atmospheric correction, the result will be errors of up to 10–20% in the worst cases. The topography will introduce difficulty in the vegetation canopy anisotropic reflectance characterization."

                "然而，旋转几何校正导致了树冠倾斜。这与树冠的地心引力特性相矛盾，树木在任何坡度上都垂直生长并与重力场对齐。单一坡度上的树冠结构和光学特性与平坦表面上的相同。例如，叶片角度分布（LAD）以及叶片的反射和透射率不受地形的影响。然而，对于离散的森林群落，树冠的阴影投影会受到树冠地心引力特性的影响。使用方程（9）进行几何校正而不考虑负地心引力将导致不正确的树冠阴影以及不适当的冠层反射率。然而，经过几何校正后，树冠实际上是倾斜的。树冠的地心引力特性在森林地形的地形校正中被强调。冠层反射率的另一个地形效应是通过全球入射太阳辐射的重新分配，这在辐射传输过程中修改了上边界条件。与平坦地形相比，地形通过改变表面的局部照明和观测几何来重新分配直接太阳辐射。地形限制了漫射天空光，并增强了从相邻坡面反射的漫射辐射。当太阳天顶角较高时，这两个漫射成分可以占据阳光坡面全球辐射的40%，当坡面被相邻地形遮挡时，这一比例甚至可以接近100%。此外，不同的海拔高度会引起气溶胶、水蒸气和云特性的浓度快速变化，从而导致直接和漫射入射辐射量的显著变化。",
