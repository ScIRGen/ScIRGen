            "description": "This data includes zircon U-Pb dating of metamorphic rocks and basalts in the Precambrian continental crust remnant in the northwest of the North Qilian orogenic belt measured from 2019 to 2021, major and trace and Sr nd Hf isotopic geochemical test results of the whole rock, and major and trace geochemical test results of minerals. The main instruments used are Aglient 7500a ICP-MS, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), thermo Finnigan Triton thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS), Neptune MC ICPMS and electron microprobe (EMPA). The data quality is high and within the error range. According to the data, the Precambrian continental crust fragments can be divided into three stages: Paleoproterozoic (1.7 GA), early Mesoproterozoic (1.6 GA) and middle Mesoproterozoic (1.5-1.2 GA), which were formed in the continental margin arc, intracontinental rift and initial ocean basin environment respectively. It is revealed that the Qilian block is located in the southwest of the core of the ancient lombia supercontinent.",

                    "Answer": "'锆石U-Pb定年' refers to zircon U-Pb dating, a method used in geology to determine the age of zircon minerals found in rocks. This technique involves measuring the ratio of uranium to lead isotopes within the zircon crystals, allowing researchers to establish precise ages for geological events. In the context of the described dataset, it is used to date metamorphic rocks and basalts from the Precambrian crust remnants in the Qilian block.",

                    "Answer": "Both ICP-MS and TIMS are used for U-Pb zircon dating; however, TIMS generally provides higher precision due to its thermal ionization process, which is less susceptible to interferences compared to the plasma ionization in ICP-MS. ICP-MS, on the other hand, is often faster and allows simultaneous multi-element analysis. The dataset indicates that both methods provide reliable results as evidenced by the consistency of the test values with recommended standard values within error margins.",

                    "Answer": "The isotopic and geochemical patterns indicate that the continental crust remnants of the Precambrian in the Qilian Block can be subdivided into three periods: late Paleoproterozoic (1.7 Ga), early Mesoproterozoic (1.6 Ga), and mid-Mesoproterozoic (1.5-1.2 Ga). These periods correspond to formation environments such as continental margin arc, intracontinental rift, and initial ocean basin. This suggests that the Qilian Block was located on the southwestern edge of the Columbia supercontinent during these times, providing insights into its tectonic history and environmental conditions.",

Additionally, the complex geological history and metamorphic processes of these crustal fragments could introduce variability that complicates precise measurements.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing combined dating methods like U-Pb zircon dating, whole-rock geochemistry, and isotope geochemistry can enhance the reliability of geological interpretations by providing comprehensive and cross-validated data. These methods can help delineate different geological events and formations, such as distinguishing between various Precambrian crustal fragments and their formation environments, like continental arc, intracontinental rift, and early oceanic basin settings. The consistency of standard material test values further supports the reliability of the data collected.",

These instruments are utilized to determine zircon U-Pb dating and geochemical compositions, including major and trace elements as well as Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic ratios. The results are validated by comparing the test values of standard materials with recommended values, ensuring data reliability. This methodological approach helps delineate the formation periods and tectonic settings of the Precambrian crustal remnants, such as those identified in the North Qilian orogenic belt.",
