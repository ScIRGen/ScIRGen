            "description": "Gridded population with 1km spaital resolution of the 34 key areas along One Belt One Road in 2015, which indicates that the population count per pixel (i.e., grid). This data is derived from socioeconomic data and applications center of Columbia University, USA. The prejection transform and extraction processes were done to generate the gridded population with 1km spaital resolution of the 34 key areas along One Belt One Road in 2015. The original gridded popution is spatially downscaled from census data by the area weighted method for each administrative unit. Accurate population data at grid level are fundamental for a broad range of applications by governments, nongovernmental organizations, and companies, including the urban planing, election, risk estimation, disaster rescue, disease control, and poverty reduction.",

This data is derived from census information at administrative levels and converted into a uniform spatial scale using area weighting based on the population and area of each administrative unit. Such datasets are used for various applications, including urban planning, election planning, risk assessment, disaster relief, disease prevention, and poverty alleviation.",

This population data is intended to support various applications such as urban planning, election planning, risk assessment, disaster relief, disease prevention and control, and poverty alleviation efforts. The dataset uses census data and spatial scale conversion to deliver a regular kilometer grid population data, and it is designed to be further refined by integrating census data, building information, and GIS remote sensing data to achieve more accurate population grid data.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves obtaining population data from administrative unit census sources, which is then converted into a regular kilometer grid format. This conversion is done through spatial scale transformation, where population data is area-weighted based on each administrative unit's population and area. Additionally, projection transformation and clipping are utilized to tailor the data to the specified critical regional nodes. This initial dataset may subsequently be refined using population census data, building information, and GIS remote sensing data to enhance accuracy.",

These methods involve using administrative unit population data and their respective areas to create a consistent kilometer grid population dataset.",
