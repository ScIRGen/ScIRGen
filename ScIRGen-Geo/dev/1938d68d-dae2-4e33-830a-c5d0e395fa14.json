            "description": "The thematic map of comprehensive zoning of multi disaster susceptibility shows the spatial distribution of multi disaster susceptibility and the combination mode of disaster types in the region. It is composed of geological disaster susceptibility, earthquake disaster susceptibility, frozen soil freeze-thaw disaster susceptibility and rainstorm flood disaster susceptibility. The data is mainly generated by the calculation of remote sensing data input susceptibility evaluation model. The input data includes disaster cataloging, landform data, climate data and geological data. The data mainly includes a thematic map and the prone grid and vector data (. SHP) used for mapping. The grid size of grid data (. TIF) is 0.01 degrees, about 1200m. The data will provide reference for the development planning of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                "Spatially interpolated gridded climate data, here referred to as 'climate surfaces', are used in many areas of work, particularly in the environmental, agricultural and biological sciences. For many applications, data at a high (≤1km2) spatial resolution are preferred to capture environmental variation that can be lost at lower spatial resolutions, particularly in mountainous and other areas with steep climate gradients. Hijmans et al. (2005) provided climate surfaces, referred to as the ‘WorldClim version 1 database’, for global land areas (excluding Antarctica), consisting of long-term average monthly temperature and precipitation. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of climate stations for which data is available, including a number of stations located at high latitudes and elevations. Furthermore, while the original dataset was limited to monthly precipitation and temperature, we also included solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure, which may be necessary to model important processes such as plant growth. Estimates for regions where weather station density (or quality) is insufficient to resolve local gradients may be improved using remotely sensed meteorological data from satellites."

Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. We compiled monthly average climate data for weather stations from a large number of global, regional, national, and local sources, mostly for the 1970–2000 period. Utilizing satellite-derived data and other covariables, we interpolated these data using the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in ANUSPLIN and created global climate surfaces for monthly precipitation and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure. Final surfaces were created by selecting only the model with the lowest cross-validation RMSE value for each region, fit to the full dataset."
