            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) mission was obtained in the Biandukou foci experimental area from 8:25 to 11:15 BJT on Mar. 21, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) microwave radiometer observations;\n     (2) the surface radiative temperature by the handheld infrared thermometer and the physical temperature by the thermocouple thermometer;\n     (3) the frost depth by the chopstick and the ruler. The soil was considered frozen when it was hard and with ice crystal;\n     (4) Snow depth by the ruler;\n     (5) the gravimetric soil moisture (soil samples from 0-1cm, 1-3cm and 3-5cm) by the microwave drying method. The volumetric moisture can be calculated by the gravimetric moisture and bulk density. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office.\n     The sample point coordinates were also included.",

Surface temperatures can be measured using a handheld infrared thermometer for radiation temperature and a thermocouple thermometer or pin-type thermistor thermometer for physical temperature.",
