            "description": "Hehuang Valley in 1800 and 1900 mainly come from New Records of Xining Mansion, Records of Xunhua Hall and New Records of Gansu, which were written in Qianlong for twenty years. The determination of county administrative boundaries refers to Atlas of Chinese History edited by Tan Qixiang and Comprehensive Table of Administrative Region Evolution in Qing Dynasty edited by Niu Hanping. After collecting cultivated land data, the original farmland data is corrected, the historical cultivated land data is converted into a unified modern unit (km²), and then the grid model is used to spatialize the two periods of cultivated land data. Hehuang Valley is one of the most important agricultural development areas in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Especially in Qing Dynasty, after a large number of immigrants settled land, the land cover in this area changed greatly. By sorting out and correcting the data of farmland in 1800 and 1900 recorded in the historical documents of this area, the spatial pattern of cultivated land in Hehuang Valley in 1800 and 1900 was restored, in order to reveal the changes of cultivated land in typical valley agricultural areas of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

It involves converting historical cropland data into a spatial format using grid-based models to visualize and analyze how land usage and agricultural practices have changed over different time periods, such as 1800 and 1900 in the Hehuang Valley.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution patterns of cropland in the 河湟谷地 region during 1800 and 1900 indicate significant land use changes, particularly due to the increased agricultural activities following the Qing Dynasty's policy of immigration and land cultivation. The transformation of land cover in this region reflects the intensification of agriculture as human activities expanded, suggesting a notable shift in the agricultural landscape of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's primary agricultural zone.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution patterns for farmland in the Hehuang Valley during the 1800 and 1900 periods were influenced by historical factors such as the documentation in 'Xining Fu Xin Zhi,' 'Xunhua Ting Zhi,' and 'Gansu Xin Tong Zhi,' as well as the administrative boundaries established based on historical maps. Additionally, the Qing Dynasty's policies promoting immigration and land reclamation significantly altered land cover, necessitating the correction and conversion of historical farmland data into modern units and their spatial allocation using grid models.",

                    "Answer": "Using historical documents such as the 《西宁府新志》、《循化厅志》, and 《甘肃新通志》 as primary sources can lead to several outcomes: it allows for the reconstruction of cultivated land patterns in the 河湟谷地 during the specified periods, offering insights into historical land use and agricultural development trends. However, it might also introduce challenges related to data accuracy and consistency, as historical records might have been influenced by the limitations in measurement techniques of the time. This approach can provide a theoretical basis for understanding changes in land cover and human activity in the region, especially considering significant transformations due to immigration and agricultural expansion during the Qing dynasty.",

By organizing and correcting historical documents and converting historical cropland data into modern units, this research provides theoretical support for understanding the agricultural transformation and impact of human activities in the valley during the Qing Dynasty, especially after the major changes brought about by immigration and farming practices.",

The administrative boundaries referenced were from '中国历史地图集' and '清代政区沿革综表'.
