            "description": "The solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence is often used as a reference of primary productivity. This data set is generated by a neural network model which uses MODIS reflectance trained to OCO-2 SIF observation data, The resultant high spatial and temporal resolution of SIF data has a temporal resolution of 4 days, and a spatial resolution of 0.05 * 0.05 degrees. Each file contains two bands \"clear-inst-SIF\" and \"clear-daily-SIF\". The clear-daily-SIF can be used as GPP approximation. See  Zhang et al. (2018) for detailed descriptions.",
            "instructions": "For 0.5 degree dataset, each file contains one year of data for each month (monthly resolution), or every 4 day (4day resolution). These files are named by the years \"OCO2.SIF.clear.daily.yyyy.nc\", where yyyy indicate the year. For 0.05 degree dataset, each file contains one day of year (DOY). The filenames include the year and DOY information \"OCO2.SIF.clear.inst.yyyydoy.v2.nc\", where yyyy indicates the year, and doy indicates the day of year.\n\nFor each DOY, clear daily SIF represents the daily averaged SIF (a good proxy of GPP) during this four day, in which the starting date is indicated by the DOY. The clear daily SIF should be more comparable with satellite observed SIF and should have a better relationship with GPP.",
