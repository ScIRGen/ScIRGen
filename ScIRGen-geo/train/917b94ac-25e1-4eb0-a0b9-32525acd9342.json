            "description": "The dataset of surface roughness was obtained at the super site (100m√ó100m, pure Qinghai spruce) around the Dayekou Guantan forest station.\n     25 corner points and 16 center points were collected and each point was measured twice and photos were taken. With the roughness plate 110cm long and the measuring points distance 1cm, the samples were collected along the strip from south to north and from east to west, respectively.\n     The photos were processed using ArcView software; and after geometric correction, surface height standard deviation (cm) and correlation length (cm) could be acquired based on the formula listed on pages 234-236, Microwave Remote Sensing, Vol. II.\n     The roughness data were initialized by the sample name, which was followed by the serial number, the name of the file, standard deviation and correlation length. Each .txt file is matched with one sample photo and standard deviation and correlation length represent the roughness. In addition, the length of 101 radius is also included for further checking.\n     Those provide reliable ground data for improving and verifying the remote sensing algorithms.",

This technique allows for precise geometric corrections and manual digitization of image coordinates, offering detailed calculations of surface height standard deviation and correlation length. Traditional methods may rely on physical contact measurements or simpler optical techniques, which might not offer the same level of spatial detail or require different processing steps, potentially impacting both accuracy and complexity.",

This method provides reliable ground data that can aid in developing and validating microwave remote sensing algorithms, as it captures detailed surface features in a systematic and repeatable manner.

At each location, measurements are taken twice using a custom roughness measurement board, which is 110 cm long with a 1 cm interval between measurement points. Measurements are conducted in both north-south and east-west directions. Photographs are taken at each point, which are later processed using ArcView software for manual digitization to record the image coordinates of the board's endpoints and radii tops. After geometric correction, the heights of the radii are calculated, which are used to compute the standard deviation of surface heights and the surface correlation length according to formulas specified in the 'Microwave Remote Sensing' Volume 2, pages 234-236.",
