            "description": "We proposed a global ISA mapping method that integrates multi-source geospatial data to automatically extract 60 million training sample points from existing global impervious surface datasets and OpenStreetMap. We performed spatiotemporal cleaning and filtering for sample collection, and adaptively classified 2.7 million Sentinel-1/-2 images to obtain a global 10-m ISA product (GISA-10m). Using multiple independent testing samples, the overall accuracy of GISA-10m exceeded 86% and showed fewer omissions in rural and arid areas. The GISA-10m dataset could be used as a fundamental parameter for Earth system science, and will provide valuable support for urban planning and water cycle study",
