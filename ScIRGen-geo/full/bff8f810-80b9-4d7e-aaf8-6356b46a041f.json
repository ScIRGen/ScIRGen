            "description": "Global solar radiation and diffuse horizontal solar radiation at Dome C (Antarctica) are measured by radiation sensors (pyranometers CM22, Kipp & Zonen Inc., The Netherlands), and water vapor pressure (hPa) at the ground are obtained from the IPEV/PNRA Project “Routine Meteorological Observation at Station Concordia”, http://www.climantartide.it. This dataset includes hourly solar radiation and its absorbing and scattering losses caused by the absorbing and scattering atmospheric substances (MJ m-2, 200-3600 nm), and the albedos at the top of the atmosphere and the surface. The above solar radiations are calculated by using an empirical model of global solar radiation (Bai, J.; Zong, X.; Lanconelli, C.; Lupi, A.; Driemel, A.; Vitale, V.; Li, K.; Song, T. 2022. Long-Term Variations of Global Solar Radiation and Its Potential Effects at Dome C (Antarctica). Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health, 19, 3084. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053084). The observed global solar radiation and meteorological parameters are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.935421. The data set can be used to study solar radiation and its attenuation at Dome C, Antarctica.",

Challenges in such extreme environments might include harsh weather conditions affecting equipment operation, data transmission issues, and maintaining accuracy and calibration of the instruments over time.",

These models rely on assumptions and approximations that may not fully capture the unique atmospheric conditions of the region, such as extreme cold, high albedo from snow and ice, and unusual solar angles.

This information contributes to broader environmental research by providing insights into solar radiation attenuation, atmospheric absorption and scattering, and surface albedo. Such data are crucial for understanding the impact of solar radiation on local climate conditions and can inform models related to climate change and atmospheric studies.",

Data on temperature and humidity are sourced from the IPEV/PNRA project 'Routine Meteorological Observation at Station Concordia.' The process includes calculating ground solar radiation, atmospheric absorption and scattering radiation using empirical models, and evaluating top-of-atmosphere and surface albedo.
