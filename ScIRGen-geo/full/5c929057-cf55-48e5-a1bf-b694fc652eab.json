            "description": "Taking 2005 as the base year, the future population scenario was predicted by adopting the Logistic model of population. It not only can better describe the change pattern of population and biomass but is also widely applied in the economic field. The urbanization rate was predicted by using the urbanization Logistic model. Based on the existing urbanization horizontal sequence value, the prediction model was established by acquiring the parameters in the parametric equation by nonlinear regression. The urban population was calculated by multiplying the predicted population by the urbanization rate. The data adopted the non-agricultural population. The Logistic model was used to predict the future gross national product of each county (or city), and then, according to the economic development level of each county (or city) in each period (in terms of GDP per capita),the corresponding industrial structure scenarios in each period were set, and the output value of each industry was predicted. The trend of changes in industrial structure in China and the research area lagged behind the growth of GDP and was therefore adjusted according to the need of the future industrial structure scenarios of the research area.",

                    "Answer": "Population arrest growth models provide a mathematical framework to describe changes in population dynamics over time, capturing the relationship between population size and environmental or economic factors. These models are valuable for predicting future population scenarios by examining growth limitations due to resources or other constraints. Urbanization logistics models, on the other hand, help estimate urbanization rates based on historical data and trends, using nonlinear regression to determine parameters that describe urban growth patterns. By integrating these models, researchers can predict future population scenarios and urbanization rates, which in turn inform projections of economic development, such as GDP and industry structure changes over time. This approach allows for more accurate planning and policy-making by anticipating how demographic shifts and urbanization will influence economic outcomes in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of population growth models, such as the population logistic growth model, is driven by the need to accurately describe the changes in population and biological quantities. This model is chosen because of its broad applicability in both biological and economic fields, ensuring that it can effectively capture future population dynamics in the context of the 玛纳斯河流域.",

This method allows for the incorporation of historical urbanization level sequences to determine parameters through nonlinear regression, which can improve the precision of predictions. However, the model's assumptions and the quality of input data may also influence the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts, potentially requiring adjustments to accommodate specific regional characteristics and trends.",

These models aim to forecast future scenarios of urbanization and industrial structure based on historical data and trends, providing insights into the non-agricultural population and economic productivity. This approach helps in understanding the lag in industrial structure changes relative to GDP growth, allowing for adjustments to be made in future scenario planning for regional economic development.",

Through nonlinear regression, parameters in the formula are determined to establish the prediction model. The urban population is then calculated by multiplying the predicted total population by the urbanization rate. The data focuses on the non-agricultural population.",
