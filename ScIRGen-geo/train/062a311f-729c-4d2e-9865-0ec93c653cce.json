            "description": "China has the longest terrestrial boundary and the highest number of neighboring countries in the world. At present, there is a lack of research on human activities at the grid scale in China's border areas. Using the land use/cover data, population density data, and night-time light data, we constructed the human activity intensity index (HAI). Taking the 50km buffer zones of China’s land boundary on each side as the study area, we calculated the HAI with a resolution of 1km in 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2020. This dataset is stored as the tif format and composed of four layers with a volume of 469 MB (compressed into one file, 4.37 MB).",

                "Human activities are disrupting biogeochemical cycles at an unprecedented scale and intensity, with profound and drastic impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. The science on human contributions to global warming is quite clear. Human emissions and activities also pose extremely high risks to planetary boundaries, such as biosphere integrity, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, and land systems, and are becoming a major factor driving global environmental change. The proposed United Nations 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to reduce the impact of human activities on the ecosystem and improve human well-being. Therefore, human activity mapping is crucial for understanding humanity’s role in shaping Earth’s patterns and processes. In addition, understanding the spatial-temporal evolution of human activity intensity on a fine scale is critical to infrastructure and local governance. Border areas, as frontiers of geo-cooperation and geo-conflict, are experiencing rapid and extensive changes in human activity. Approximately one-fifth of global WorldPop-based population growth has occurred in the borderlands since the 1990s, leading to more than one-third of forest loss, as estimated by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative. Globally, more than half of all terrestrial birds, mammals, and amphibians cross international borders. In addition to being threatened by deforestation and hunting, these species may be harmed by border infrastructure building and lack of conversation activity coordination on both sides of the border."

The population density data in 1992 was replaced with data from 1990 because it was lacking, using its Gridded Population of the World (GPW) data(v3) with 2.5 arcmin resolution. Population density data from 2000 to 2020 were adopted from UN World Population Prospects (WPP)-Adjusted Population Density (v4.10) with 1 km resolution. We adopted the global nighttime light intensity dataset processed by Li et al., which harmonized DMSP and VIIRS nighttime light data from 1992 to 2018 on a global scale, including temporally calibrated DMSP-OLS NTL time series data from 1992 to 2013 and converted NTL time series from the VIIRS data (2014–2018)."

Overall, the HAI on the Chinese side is higher than that on the neighboring side, and the intensity of land use on the Chinese side has increased significantly from 1992 to 2020. Among China’s neighbors, India has the highest HAI with the fastest growth. With the changes in the HAI between China and its neighboring countries, four regional evolution patterns are found in the study area: Sino-Russian HAI decline; Sino-Kazakhstan HAI unilateral growth; Indian HAI continuous growth; China and Indochina HAI synchronized growth. Hotspot analysis reveals three spatial evolution patterns, which are unilateral expansion, bilateral expansion, and cross-border fusion. Both the “border effect” and “agglomeration effect” exist in border areas. The HAI changes in border areas not only impact the eco-environment but also affect geopolitics and geoeconomics. The HAI can be used as an instrument for decision-making and cooperation between China and neighboring countries in such areas as ecological protection, border security, and border trade."

                    "Answer": "To develop a human activity intensity index at a regional scale, especially in border areas, data collection methods can include utilizing land cover data from a global land cover database, population density data from sources such as the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center, and satellite-based nighttime light data. These datasets should be processed to ensure compatibility in terms of resolution and temporal calibration to accurately reflect human activity over time.",

This is evident in the findings that highlight differing HAI patterns between China and its neighboring countries, influenced by both the 'border effect' and 'agglomeration effect'.",

                    "Answer": "The use of land cover, population density, and nighttime light data as indicators is effective as it provides a comprehensive measure of human activity intensity. These indicators capture various aspects of human presence and development, which are critical for understanding the spatial-temporal evolution of human activities on a fine scale in border regions. However, their effectiveness may vary depending on the resolution and accuracy of the data sources.",
