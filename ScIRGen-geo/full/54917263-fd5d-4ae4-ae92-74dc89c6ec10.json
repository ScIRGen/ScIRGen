            "description": "In the Lena Qu (River) watershed, located in the south of Sister Lakes (i.e., the Gyaring and Ngöring Lakes in the HAYR, we conducted permafrost hydrological and meteorological observations were conducted in a permafrost-dominated basin called the Shuangchagou Basin. In mid-April, 2014, a rectangular hydrological monitoring section was installed at the stream’s outlet in the Shuangchagou Basin. To prevent water leakage, the bottom of the hydrological section was in contact with the impervious bedrock. From late April to October, the velocity (V) at the hydrological section was measured using the LS10B Propeller Velocity Meter, and meanwhile, the flow depth (h) was measured using a water ruler. Then, the runoff (Q) could be calculated using the water cross-section area (Ω) at the gauging station and the velocity (V). The water cross-section area (Ω) was calculated by multiplying the width (w) of the rectangular hydrological section by the measured flow depth (h). The LS10B Propeller Flow Meter was had a measurement range of 0.1 to 4.0 m/s (within a working water depth of 1.2 m), a mean square deviation of the verification formula ≤±1.5%, and an operating environment temperature range of ‒10 to 45 °C. Meanwhile, the HOBO water level meter (U20-001-01) produced by the Onset Computer Corporation, USA was used to automatically measure the flow depth at the gauging station, and the water level was converted into discharge using Flow Rating Curves (FRCs). The measurement range of the HOBO water level meter was <9.0 m, with an accuracy of 0.5 cm and a resolution of 0.21 cm. This submitted dataset of the mean monthly runoff (unit: L/s) in the Shuangchagou permafrost watershed was from May 2014 to January 2015.\n",

                    "Answer": "In the context of data collection for small permafrost watershed runoff, a 'hydrometric monitoring section' refers to a designated area where hydrological measurements are taken to monitor water flow. This involves setting up a rectangular section at the outlet of the small watershed to measure runoff velocity using a propeller-type flow meter and water depth using a water gauge. These measurements help calculate the discharge and establish an empirical formula for the relationship between water level and flow rate.",

                    "Answer": "The LS10B propeller current meter measures flow velocity directly, with a range of 0.1 to 4.0 m/s and an operating environment temperature of -10 to 45°C. It requires manual measurement of flow velocity and depth to calculate discharge. In contrast, the HOBO water level logger automatically observes runoff depth, and the data is converted to discharge using an empirical stage-discharge relationship. The HOBO logger has a measurement range of less than 9 m, with an accuracy of 0.5 cm and a resolution of 0.21 cm. The LS10B provides direct velocity measurements, while the HOBO relies on indirect depth measurements, which may impact accuracy depending on the precision of the stage-discharge relationship.",

These measurements can help infer the relationship between water level and flow rate, revealing insights into how permafrost conditions affect hydrological processes such as runoff and water retention.",

However, environmental challenges such as extreme temperatures and the depth limits of ≤1.2 m could affect the accuracy and consistency of the data, potentially leading to a mean square error of ≤±1.5% in the derived flow rate calculations.",

                    "Answer": "In a permafrost sub-watershed, monthly average runoff is measured using a combination of LS10B propeller flow meters and HOBO water level loggers. The LS10B flow meters measure flow velocity within a range of 0.1 to 4.0 m/s, with an operational water depth of up to 1.2 m and a mean square error of calibration formula ≤±1.5%. They are suitable for temperatures ranging from ‒10 to 45°C. The cross-sectional area for flow is calculated by multiplying the width of the rectangular hydrological monitoring section by the measured runoff depth. HOBO water level loggers (model U20-001-01) automatically observe the runoff depth, which is then converted into discharge using an empirical water level-discharge relationship curve. The HOBO loggers have a measurement range of less than 9 m, with a water level accuracy of 0.5 cm and a resolution of 0.21 cm, ensuring accurate and reliable measurement under varying environmental conditions.",
