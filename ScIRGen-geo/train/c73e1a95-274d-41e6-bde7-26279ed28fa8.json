            "description": "The data set contains the average contents of selenium in soil, drinking water, main grains (highland barley, tsamba, wheat, imported rice, etc.) and human hair in Kashin-Beck Disease endemic areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The data were mainly collected from all the relevant Chinese and English literatures published from 2000 to 2018, according to the strict literature screening criteria and quality evaluation by experts. Some of the data were collected from self-testing of samples. The monitoring values of different years in the same region (county or district) were integrated by the weighted average of the sample size and the average selenium content of the sample. This data set covers 39 counties affected with Kashin-Beck disease in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, basically covering the main areas of each endemic area. The effective sample sizes were more than 7000. It can reflect the average selenium level in the endemic areas of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at the present stage, and provide a data basis for the prevention and control of endemic diseases in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as well as the study of relationships between selenium and other related diseases.",

                    "Answer": "Weighted average integration refers to the method of combining selenium concentration data from the same region over different years by using the sample size and the average selenium content of the samples as weights. This approach helps to consolidate data more accurately to reflect the average selenium levels in the specified area, accounting for variations in sample sizes across different studies.",

                    "Answer": "Incorporating a broader range of sample types over an extended period could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of selenium distribution and its variations across different environmental media and human populations. It may enhance the accuracy of selenium level assessments in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and provide deeper insights into the relationship between selenium content and the prevalence of local conditions like Kashin-Beck disease. This could inform the development of more effective public health strategies and environmental management policies.",

The dataset aims to provide a comprehensive view of selenium distribution across soils, water, and staple foods, as well as in human hair, based on data collected from extensive literature and sample testing from 2000 to 2018.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of selenium content measurements involves collecting data from soil, drinking water, and major grains such as barley, zanba, wheat, and rice. The data are mainly sourced from all relevant Chinese and English literature published between 2000 and 2018, following strict literature screening standards and expert quality evaluations. Additionally, some data are obtained from self-measured samples.

                    "Answer": "The selenium content in environmental samples from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is derived from data spanning 2000-2018, which includes samples from soil, drinking water, and major grains. The dataset utilizes a weighted average to integrate selenium levels from various monitoring efforts across different years and regions. This approach, coupled with variability in local environmental conditions and potential gaps in data collection, might lead to discrepancies between measured and expected selenium levels.",
