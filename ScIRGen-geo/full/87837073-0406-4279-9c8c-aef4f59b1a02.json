            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Landsat TM was obtained in the Linze grassland and Linze station foci experimental area on Sep. 23, 2007 during the pre-observation periods, and one scene was captured well. These data can provide reliable ground data for retrieval and validation of land surface temperatures with EO-1 Hyperion remote sensing approaches.\n    Observation items included:\n    (1) the land surface radiative temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer, which was calibrated; \n    (2) GPS by GARMIN GPS 76;\n    (3) atmospheric parameters at Daman Water Management office measured by CE318 (produced by CIMEL in France). The total optical depth, aerosol optical depth, Rayleigh scattering coefficient, column water vapor in 936 nm, particle size spectrum and phase function were then retrieved from these observations. The optical depth in 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm and 440nm were all acquired by CE318. These data include the raw data in .k7 format and can be opened by ASTPWin software. ReadMe.txt is attached for detail. Processed data (after retrieval of the raw data) in Excel contain optical depth, rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. \n    (4) ground-based land surface temperature measurements by the thermal imager in the Heihe gobi, west of Zhangye city.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of surface radiation temperature measurements using handheld infrared thermometers can be influenced by several factors, including the calibration of the instruments, environmental conditions during data collection, and the inherent limitations of the infrared technology used. In the context of remote sensing experiments, such as those conducted in the Linze grassland and Linze station, it is crucial to ensure that the infrared thermometers are properly calibrated to minimize errors in temperature readings. Variations in atmospheric conditions, such as humidity and aerosols, can also impact the accuracy of the measurements. Additionally, the skill and consistency of the operator in using the handheld device can affect the data quality.",
