            "description": "This dataset includes data obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Meteorological elements of Huailai station between January 1 and December 31, 2021. The site (115.7880° E, 40.3491° N) was located on a maize surface, which is near Donghuayuan Town of Huailai city in Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (5 m, north), wind speed and direction profile (10 m, north), air pressure (in the box), rain gauge (10 m), four-component radiometer (5 m, south), two infrared temperature sensors (5 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (-0.06 m), soil temperature profile (0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), soil moisture profile (-0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), and a TCAV averaging soil thermocouple probe (-0.02, -0.04 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m; RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), soil moisture (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content), and average soil temperature (TCAV, ℃).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2021-6-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

By analyzing the temporal and spatial variations in soil moisture in conjunction with atmospheric parameters, one can infer how atmospheric conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and radiation influence moisture retention and movement in the soil. Additionally, the relationship between surface fluxes, such as soil heat flux and net radiation, and soil moisture can reveal insights into the energy balance and water cycle dynamics at the site.",
