            "description": "Water is one of the most direct mediums through which people perceive the effects of climate change. The flow regimes that people rely on are influenced by large-scale climate change, and identifying changes to these regimes and determining their causes requires reliable, spatiotemporally continuous runoff records. China is climate vulnerable due to its remarkable topographic gradients, monsoon climate, and rapid economic development. Climate change has increased the urgency of understanding, regulating, and forecasting China’s freshwater flows. Yet, available global and regional runoff data in China are produced from sparse, poor-quality gauged station data that have been acquired over different time scales. Our research presents a new long-term, high-quality natural runoff dataset, named the China Natural Runoff Dataset version 1.0 (CNRD v1.0) for driving hydrological and climate studies over China. It will also contribute to the global runoff database. CNRD v1.0 provides daily, monthly, and annual 0.25-degree natural runoff estimates for the period of 1 January 1961 to 31 December 2018 over China.\n\nCNRD v1.0 is generated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity macroscale hydrological model, which was used to fill in gaps or construct time series of comparable lengths. To control the model performance and thus our dataset quality, the model’s sensitive parameters are automatically calibrated using an adaptive surrogate modeling‐based optimization algorithm based on monthly natural or near-natural streamflow data from 200 hydrological gauge stations—more than in previous studies—with low fractions of missing data. Another important quality control adopted for this dataset was the use of a multiscale parameter regionalization technique to estimate model parameters for ungauged basins. \n\nOverall, the results show well-calibrated parameters for most gauged catchments, and the skill scores, the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) present high values for all catchments, with an average of 0.83 and 0.80 for calibration and validation modes, respectively. The multiscale parameter regionalization technique offered the best regionalization solution (median NSE = 0.76 for the calibration period and 0.72 for the validation period. The results overall show well-calibrated and regionalized parameters for the hydrological model thus for the long-term runoff reconstruction. By the cell-to-cell comparisons between the CNRD v1.0 with the two global runoff datasets, ISIMIP and GRUN, we found that our datasets show more continuous transitions in runoff dis¬tribution compared to ISIMIP and GRUN across China, and perform well in representing the geographic distribution of China’s water resources across complex terrain and climate regions.",

                "Reconstruction of natural streamﬂow is fundamental to the sustainable management of water resources. In China, previous reconstructions from sparse and poor-quality gauge measurements have led to large biases in simulation of the interannual and seasonal variability of natural ﬂows. Balancing water supply and demand for sustainable water management across different regions is highly dependent on accurate, reliable surface ﬂow records. Collection of long-term observational streamﬂow datasets worldwide is necessary to provide an evidence-based foundation for hydrological studies. China has serious water scarcity problems given that it has only one-quarter of the world average of per capita freshwater resources. The uneven distribution of water resources driven by a monsoon climate and complicated topography has exacerbated water scarcity across China. In fact, observed ﬂow regimes are greatly affected by human activities, including water diversion, water withdrawal, and reservoir operation. Thus natural streamﬂow estimation is needed for comparison with previous streamﬂow records and to help interpret climate information (e.g., precipitation and temperature) in hydrometeorology studies. Hydrological models that incorporate both the physical and climatic characteristics of basins appear effective tools to reconstruct the ﬂow of a regulated river system."

These long-term national datasets are useful in the assessment and allocation of natural water resources, and in studying the impact of climate change on the terrestrial water cycle in China. Such developed streamﬂow datasets without anthropogenic inﬂuences are vitally needed in the worldwide effort to tackle the water crisis and strengthen resilience to climate change."

Reconstruction of natural ﬂows is very complex because it involves several non-linear hydrological processes and a variety of spatiotemporal scales, ranging from watershed to global and from months to millennia. Traditional reconstruction methods, such as the water balance method and regression method, encounter problems when describing the natural ﬂow in a basin with strong anthropogenic disturbances, scarce observations, and dynamic surrounding environment."

                "Here we use a well-trained and tested land surface model coupled to a routing model with ﬂow direction correction to reconstruct the ﬁrst high-quality gauge-based natural streamﬂow dataset for China, covering all its 330 catchments during the period from 1961 to 2018. We ran the VIC model version 4.2 in water balance mode for daily time step increments. We also introduce a parameter-uncertainty analysis framework including sensitivity analysis, optimization, and regionalization, which further minimizes biases between modeled and inferred natural streamﬂow from natural or near-natural gauges. The VIC model was established on a 0.25°×0.25° grid, with meteorological forcing including daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and wind speed variables taken from 2,400 weather stations. We manually corrected the D8 ﬂow direction based on the 330 gauge locations, corresponding gauge areas, and high-resolution river ﬂowlines. To control the quality of the reconstructed streamﬂow data, a large dataset of monthly inferred natural/near-natural streamﬂow records from 1961 to 1979 for 330 gauge stations was used to train and test the models. Both the land-surface model and routing model were trained. For the routing model test, we checked that the number of upstream routing cells (0.25°×0.25°) matched the observed drainage area for each gauge station. Parameter regionalization transferred optimized parameters from gauged to ungauged catchments. We used four global sensitivity analysis methods to screen important parameters for the 10 water resources regions of China. Then an adaptive surrogate modeling-based optimization (ASMO) was used to find the optimal parameter solution. The multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique estimated values for the optimal parameter in ungauged areas. As a benchmark reference to natural records, streamﬂow data from a subset of 230 stations were used to train the coupled land-surface and routing model, thus reconstructing China’s natural streamﬂow. We tuned the sensitive parameters of modeled streamﬂow for each training station in succession from upstream to downstream during the calibration period (1961–1969) and estimated the corresponding parameters for ungauged areas."
