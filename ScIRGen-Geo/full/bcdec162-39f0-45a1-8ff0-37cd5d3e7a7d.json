            "description": "The considerable amount of solid clastic material in the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin (YTRB)) is one of the important components in recording the uplift and denudation history of the Tibet Plateau. Different types of unconsolidated sediments directly reflect the differential transport of solid clastic material. Revealing its spatial distribution and total accumulation plays an important value in the uplift and denudation process of the Tibet Plateau. The dataset includes three subsets: the type and spatial distribution of unconsolidated sediments in theYTRB, the thickness spatial distribution, and the quantification of total deposition. Taking remote sensing interpretation and geological mapping as the main technical method, the classification and spatial distribution characteristics of unconsolidated sediments in the whole YTRB (16 composite sub-basins) were comprehensively clarified for the first time. Based on the field measurement of sediment thickness, the total accumulation was preliminarily estimated. A massive amount of sediment is an important material source of landslide, debris flow and flood disasters in the basin. Finding out its spatial distribution and total amount accumulation not only has theoretical significance for revealing the key information recorded in the process of sediment source to sink, such as surface environmental change, regional tectonic movement, climate change and biogeochemical cycle, but also has important application value for plateau ecological environment monitoring and protection, flooding disaster warning and prevention, major basic engineering construction, and soil and water conservation.",

The formation, transportation and sedimentation of these sediments archive a great deal of essential information on the planetary surface processes, climate change and biogeochemical cycles. Not only that, the extensive unconsolidated deposits on the land surface play a significant role in making decisions about land-use planning and management, soil and water conservation, agricultural development, landslide and associated natural hazard prevention. In recent decades, numerous studies provided insights into the interplay between tectonic and climate based on depositional environment, sedimentary facies and geochemistry of Quaternary sediments. The considerable amount of unconsolidated sediment in the YTRB is one of the crucial components in recording the evolution of orogenic belts. Identifying the spatial distribution pattern and total deposition is of great value for understanding regional climate change, tectonic movements and human-nature interaction."
