            "description": "A 170-cm-long sediment core was extracted from Lake Xingxinghai at a water depth of 9 m (34°50.44′N, 98°06.34′E) in January 2010 using Austria’s UWITEC platform coring equipment. Both the 210Pb/137Cs and AMS 14C (11 dating data) approaches were applicated into the age-depth model establishment using Bayesian age–depth modelling by the “Bacon” software, and the age-depth model indicates the core covers the past 7400 years. The core was sliced at 0.5-cm interval upper 3 cm and 1-cm interval for other part, finally we got 173 samples totally. Pollen grains were extracted using a procedure including the treatments with 10 % HCl, 10 % NaOH and 40 % HF, followed by a 7-μm mesh sieving and acetolysis treatment (9:1 mixture of acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid). Pollen grains were identified and counted under optical microscope, and at least 300 terrestrial pollen grains were counted for each sample. The mean temporal resolution of pollen spectra is ca. 40 year/sample.\nThe pollen spectra include forty-eight pollen taxa, are dominated by herbaceous taxa (range: 88.5~98.9%; mean: 93.4%), such as Artemisia (up to 54.4%), Cyperaceae (up to 50.1%), Poaceae (up to 48.8%), Chenopodiaceae (up to 17.9%) and Asteraceae (up to 8.5%). Abundance of arboreal pollen is less than 5% through out the core, mainly comprised of Pinus (maximum: 4.9%; mean:1.2%) and Betula (maximum: 3.0%; mean: 0.7%). The pollen dataset includes pollen percentages for the 43 terrestrial pollen taxa together with their depths and ages, and the dataset is valuable to employed in past vegetation and climate reconstructions.",

                "Understanding past vegetation variations and their driving mechanisms on a long-term scale provides a theoretical basis for current vegetation protection and restoration measures. Vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is fragile and sensitive to climate changes and human impacts. With the TP warming 50% faster than the global average, the vegetation ecosystem is under threat and subject to change in the near future. Evolution of the vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau over a long period can reveal a pattern of global changes, such as changes in ocean circulation, the carbon cycle, climate and glacial cycles. Besides climate change, human activities such as grazing can severely impact local vegetation, cause grassland degradation and enhance soil erosion. Lacustrine pollen records with continuous sedimentation and high temporal resolution are an important archive of past vegetation changes on the TP and, along with other paleoenvironmental proxies, can be used to investigate the drivers of environmental change. Previous vegetational and environmental histories of the TP inferred from pollen data show strong spatial peculiarities. For example, pollen records from the south-eastern TP have revealed that the regional vegetation evolution is generally correlated with the evolution of the Indian Summer Monsoon, while the vegetation on the eastern TP is more strongly driven by the East Asian Summer Monsoon. Lake Xingxinghai (XXH) is located in the Yellow River Source Area (YRSA), which can be influenced by both the Asian Summer Monsoon (including Indian Summer Monsoon and East Asian Summer Monsoon) and the westerlies. Due to the importance of the YRSA for downstream ecosystems, ecosystem variations in this region have been investigated to understand the impact of climate change and human activities."

We aim to reconstruct the past vegetation and environment for the YRSA, investigate their driving factors, and determine whether past vegetation was disturbed by human activities in the YRSA."

                "A 170-cm-long sediment core was extracted from XXH at a water depth of 9 m in January 2010 using UWITEC’s piston corer equipment. For the upper 3 cm, the core was subsampled at 0.5 cm intervals; for the rest, it was sliced at 1 cm intervals, providing 173 samples in total. The top 12 cm of the core were analysed for 210Pb and 137Cs by direct gamma assay in the Liverpool University Environmental Radioactivity Laboratory using Ortec HPGe GWL series well-type coaxial low background intrinsic germanium detectors. A total of 11 samples from different depths including eight organic sediment samples, two plant material samples and one charred material sample were used for radiocarbon dating in the Poznan Radiocarbon Laboratory (Poland). Sediment samples were analysed for pollen composition, grain size, carbonate and total organic carbon. Approximately 1 cm3 of sediment was used for pollen extraction per sample. Coarse particles were removed by sieving through a 200-μm mesh, and one tablet of Lycopodium spores (approximately 27,637 ± 563 grains) was added to each sample for calculating pollen concentration. Pollen grains were extracted using a procedure including treatments with 10% HCl, 10% NaOH and 40% HF, followed by a 7-μm mesh sieving and acetolysis treatment. Pollen grains were identified and counted under an optical microscope, with the help of modern pollen reference slides for common plant species of alpine meadow in the eastern TP and pollen atlases. Grain-size analysis was performed using a MasterSizer 2000 laser grain-size analyser after samples were pretreated with 10% H2O2 to remove organic matter, 10% HCl to remove carbonate, and then sodium hexametaphosphate to disperse aggregates. Carbonate content was semi-quantitatively analysed by an X’Pert3 X-ray diffractometer. Total organic matter content (TOC) was extracted using the antititration method with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7). It was then quantified using a CE440 Elemental Analyzer after being treated with 10% HCl at 80 °C to remove carbonate."

Slight vegetation change is inferred from an increasing trend of Cyperaceae and decreasing trend of Poaceae, suggesting that alpine steppe was replaced by alpine meadow at ca. 3.5 ka cal bp. The vegetation transformation indicates a generally wetter climate during the middle and late Holocene, which is supported by increased amounts of TOC and Pediastrum (representing high water-level) and is consistent with previous past climate records from the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results find no evidence of human impact on the regional vegetation surrounding XXH, hence we conclude the vegetation change likely reflects the regional climate signal."

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps for extracting pollen grains from sediment samples involve using approximately 1 cm3 of sediment per sample. Coarse particles are removed by sieving through a 200-μm mesh, and one tablet of Lycopodium spores is added to each sample for calculating pollen concentration. Pollen grains are extracted using treatments with 10% HCl, 10% NaOH, and 40% HF, followed by a 7-μm mesh sieving and acetolysis treatment. Pollen grains are then identified and counted under an optical microscope, with modern pollen reference slides and pollen atlases aiding identification.",

The samples include organic sediment, plant material, and charred material. The model is developed using Bayesian statistics via the Bacon software, ensuring a reliable chronology spanning the last 7,400 years.",

                    "Answer": "Detailed analysis of pollen composition is enabled by extracting sediment cores with high temporal resolution. In this domain, a 170-cm-long sediment core was subsampled at 0.5 cm intervals for the upper section and at 1 cm intervals for the rest, resulting in 173 samples. This precise sampling allowed for the extraction and identification of pollen grains using techniques like sieving, adding Lycopodium spores for concentration calculations, and treatments with chemical solutions for pollen extraction.",

                    "Answer": "Deviations from expected dating results in sediment cores, such as those observed at specific depths, could occur due to factors like erosion or the introduction of old carbon from the catchment area. These deviations can be addressed by identifying and treating them as outliers, which can be excluded from the age-depth model to improve accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "Certain pollen components may remain stable over long periods due to consistent ecological conditions or dominant vegetation types that persist despite climate variations. This stability can imply that the regional climate signal has remained relatively unchanged, providing insights into enduring environmental conditions and aiding in the reconstruction of past vegetation and climate dynamics.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating grain-size and total organic carbon analysis with pollen data in paleoenvironmental studies provides a holistic view of past environmental conditions. While pollen data offer insights into vegetation composition and changes, grain-size analysis helps infer sedimentary processes and hydrodynamic conditions, and total organic carbon provides information on productivity and organic matter accumulation. This multi-proxy approach enhances the understanding of ecosystem dynamics and environmental drivers.",

In this research, pollen analysis, grain-size distribution, total organic carbon, and carbonate content are examined from the sediment core to infer past vegetation types and climate conditions over 7,400 years. Pollen grains serve as indicators of vegetation, while grain-size and organic content provide clues about climatic conditions.",
