            "description": "This data set contains the surface temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture data measured simultaneously during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR) in 2018, which is used as \"true value\" to validate the remote sensing retrieval. The dataset includes soil moisture (volumetric water content, %) of the surface layer (0-5cm), soil moisture of the deeper layers (5, 10, 20, 40 cm), temperature (℃) of shaded soil, illuminated soil, 5-cm soil, shaded and illuminated vegetation.\nThe ground synchronous sampling quadrats were distributed in the upstream of Luan River (Shandian River Watershed and Xiaoluan River Watershed), and the sampling time was September in 2018. ML3 soil moisture sensor, TR-52i temperature sensor, soil ring sampler were used for measurement. The sampling scheme of Large Quadrat--Small Quadrat--Sampling Location was adopted to obtain data.",

                    "Answer": "Factors contributing to the accuracy of soil temperature and moisture measurements include the use of portable soil moisture meters, external probe-type temperature recorders, and the ring knife method. Additionally, the nested sampling scheme of sample area-sample plot-sample point and the timing of the sampling in September 2018 play a role in ensuring accurate data collection.",
