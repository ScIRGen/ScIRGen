            "description": "The samples were collected from the suobcha section of Wenquan area, South Qiangtang sag, Qiangtang basin, Tibet. The carbon isotope data were measured by thermo Finnigan mat-253 carbon isotope mass spectrometer at Beijing Institute of uranium geology, CNNC. The mass extinction event of the Late Triassic is relatively poorly-known among the five major extinction events in the Phanerozoic. Moreover, the typical marine Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) records are absent in regions other than the western Tethys and Boreal realms, and thus major questions remain as to the global significance and cause(s) of the event. Especially in the eastern Tethys, no marine sedimentary records of the T-J transition are known from open marine facies, and thus the extent and significance of the marine T-J transition are unclear. We show the first high-resolution carbonate carbon-isotope record, geochemistry, palaeontologic and lithological data from a marine T-J section (Wenquan section). In the columnar profile, we place the T-J boundary at the top of grainstone layers representing the shallowest water deposit. Our results reveal that the carbonate carbon-isotope record contains two different excursions in the Wenquan section of northern Tibet, China. These are consistent with the “initial” and “main” negative carbon-isotope excursions (CIEs) found in the global stratotype section and point (GSSP), strongly suggesting their global nature. A biological crisis together with paleoceanographic changes was identified near the main CIE. This means that a mass of isotopically light carbon was rapidly released into the air and oceans, resulting in environmental changes and biological crisis.",

                    "Answer": "The carbon isotope data collection in the South Qiangtang depression uses samples taken from a specific section and analyzed with a Thermo Finnigan MAT-253 mass spectrometer. This method captures high-resolution inorganic carbon isotope curves, which show distinct negative shifts consistent with global stratotype section records. The comparison reveals that the data from the South Qiangtang depression can be globally correlated through these isotope characteristics, aligning with similar GSSPs that record comparable carbon isotope features across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.",

                    "Answer": "Using high-resolution inorganic carbon isotope curves in marine stratigraphy across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary allows researchers to identify patterns of carbon isotope excursions, which are globally comparable. These patterns can reveal significant environmental changes, such as mass volcanic eruptions that release light carbon isotopes, potentially leading to greenhouse effects and environmental shifts. Such data can offer insights into past biological crises and their correlation with carbon isotope anomalies, enhancing the understanding of historical climate and ecological changes.",
