            "description": "The dataset contains the data of atmospheric aerosol total suspended particulate matter (TSP), mineral dust aerosol concentration, and aerosol samples sampled offline at 15 stations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas (Taxkorgan, Minfeng, Ruoqiang, Qilian, Maduo, Zaduo, Golmud, Ganzi, Nagqu, Medog, Ritu, Burang, Lhaze, Xainza, and Gerze). The sample measuring instruments are Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The observation period was from May 15, 2021 to May 27, 2023, with a sampling duration of 48 hours and a temporal resolution of 3 days. The abnormal data generated during the operation of the instrument has been eliminated. This dataset provides basic data for the study of the physical characteristics, spatiotemporal variation characteristics and source analysis of atmospheric dust aerosols in the plateau area. This research was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP,Grant No. 2019QZKK0602)",
