            "description": "The molecular circuitry that causes stem cells to exit from pluripotency remains largely uncharacterized.     Using chromatin RNA in situ reverse transcription sequencing, we identified Peln1 as a novel chromatin RNA component in the promoter complex of Oct4, a stem cell master transcription factor gene.     Peln1 was negatively associated with pluripotent status during somatic reprogramming.     Peln1 overexpression caused E14 cells to exit from pluripotency, while Peln1 downregulation induced robust reprogramming.     Mechanistically, we discovered that Peln1 interacted with the Oct4 promoter and recruited the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A.     By de novo altering the epigenotype in the Oct4 promoter, Peln1 dismantled the intrachromosomal loop that is required for the maintenance of pluripotency.     Using RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing, we showed that Peln1 targets multiple pathway genes that are associated with stem cell self-renewal.     These findings demonstrate that Peln1 can act as a new epigenetic player and use a trans mechanism to induce an exit from the pluripotent state in stem cells.",

It helps identify RNA components, like Peln1, associated with chromatin complexes involved in pluripotency regulation.

This method can reveal interactions between lncRNA and key transcription factors, like Oct4, and how these interactions affect epigenetic modifications through the recruitment of enzymes such as DNMT3A. Consequently, it provides insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the exit from pluripotency, and identifies lncRNA such as Peln1 as potential epigenetic participants in this process, thereby expanding understanding of stem cell biology and reprogramming.",
