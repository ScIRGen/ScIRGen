            "description": "The distribution data of permafrost in the source area of the Yellow River is established based on the annual average ground temperature model of permafrost in the source area of the Yellow River. The annual average ground temperature of 0 ℃ is taken as the standard and boundary for dividing seasonal frozen soil and permafrost. Compared with the available permafrost maps of the source region of the Yellow River (1:3 million) and the permafrost background survey project of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (1:1 million), the data set is based on the measured data of the Yellow River source area, which has higher consistency with the measured data, and the simulation accuracy of the permafrost distribution map is the highest. The data set can be used to verify the distribution of permafrost in the source area of the Yellow River, as well as to study the frozen soil environment.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of permafrost distribution data collection, an 'annual average ground temperature model' refers to a theoretical framework or computational model used to estimate the average ground temperature over a year. This model helps to delineate the boundaries between seasonal and permafrost regions by setting 0°C as the threshold. It is based on empirical data collected from the field, providing a higher accuracy in simulating permafrost distribution, particularly in the Yellow River Source Region.",

                    "Answer": "The model-based approach for permafrost distribution in the Yellow River Source Region is based on ground temperature measurements and has a higher accuracy and simulation precision compared to traditional permafrost maps like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau permafrost map. It provides a more accurate representation because it aligns closely with actual measured data, using mean annual ground temperature models to delineate permafrost boundaries.",

                    "Answer": "To enhance the accuracy and precision of permafrost distribution models in the Yellow River source area, one could start by integrating measured ground temperature data to validate and calibrate model predictions. It would involve establishing a model based on annual average ground temperature with 0°C as the boundary between seasonal and permafrost, which is a key consideration in existing high-resolution maps like those of the Tibetan Plateau. Implementing comprehensive field validation and comparison with available distribution maps at various scales can further improve the model's fidelity. Consistent data collection over multiple years (e.g., 2013-2015) can ensure temporal robustness and align with empirical observations for model refinement.",
