            "description": "This dataset contains in-situ lake level observations at Lumajiangdong Co, Memar Co，Camelot Lake and Jieze Caka on the western Tibetan Plateau.\nThe lake water level was monitored by HOBO water level logger (U20-001-01) or Solist water level logger, which was installed on the lake shore. Lake level data was then calibrated by using the barometer installed near the lake. Then the real water level changes were obtained. The accuracy was less than 0.5 cm.\nThe items of this dataset are as follows:\nDaily lake level changes at Lumajiangdong Co from 2016 to 2021;\nDaily lake level changes at Memar Co from 2017 to 2019 and from 2020 to 2021;\nDaily lake level changes at Luotuo Lake from 2019 to 2020.\nDaily lake level changes at Jieze Caka Lake from 2019 to 2020.\nWater level, unit: m.",
