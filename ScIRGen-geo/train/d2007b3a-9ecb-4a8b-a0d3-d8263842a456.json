            "titleEn": "The diurnal（hourly）albedo product coupling topographic effects and combining multi-sensory data over the Tibet Plateau (2016-2019)",
            "description": "This diurnal (hourly) land surface albedo product is with a spatial resolution of 0.02 ° x 0.02 ° over the Tibet Plateau from 2016-2019. Multi-sensory data is used to retrieve the Extended Multi-Sensor Combined BRDF Inversion model (EMCBI) developed from a kernel-driven BRDF model and coupled with topographic effects, and prior knowledge is introduced for quality control inversion. The high-precision BRDF / albedo of good spatial-temporal continuity is retrieved by combining MODIS reflectance data (a polar orbiting satellite) and himiwarri-8 AHI land surface reflectance (a geostationary satellite ). MODIS land surface reflectance data and AHI TOA reflectance data are downloaded from the official websites. After registration, atmospheric correction and other processing, the daily resolution BRDF is synthesized with a period of 5 days, and then the albedo is estimated. The black sky albedo is calculated hourly from 9:00 to 18:00 at Beijing Time (UTM zone 8). The validation results show that it meets the accuracy requirements of albedo application, and agreed well with the in situ albedo inner-daily variation.Tt has more advantages in capturing rapidly changing surface features, especially the inner-daily variations, and has better temporal and spatial continuity. It can effectively support the study of radiation energy balance and environmental change in the Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The use of a BRDF model in capturing the diurnal variation of surface albedo in the Tibetan Plateau region is necessitated by the coupling of terrain effects and the need for high-precision temporal and spatial resolution. The model incorporates multi-source remote sensing data and prior knowledge for quality control, allowing for the integration of MODIS and Himawari-8 AHI satellite reflectance data to achieve continuous daily-resolution BRDF/albedo, which effectively captures the diurnal changes crucial for studies on radiative balance and environmental changes in the region.",

This approach can improve data accuracy by capturing more detailed daily variations, which are critical for understanding radiation balance and environmental change in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.

The integration involves leveraging these datasets to perform a spatiotemporal inversion to achieve high-precision daily BRDF/albedo data. The MODIS surface reflectance data (MOD09GA, MYD09GA) and AHI zenith reflectance data are downloaded from official websites. A five-day cycle is used to synthesize daily BRDF, which is then used to estimate diurnal albedo variations.
