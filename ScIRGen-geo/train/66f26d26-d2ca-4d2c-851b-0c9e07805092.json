            "description": "With the warming climate, profound changes are occurring in the global water cycle. China, being a sensitive area to global climate change, is experiencing more pronounced impacts. Glacial retreat is a crucial indicator of climate warming, and obtaining accurate information on glacier thickness distribution or volume changes plays a vital role in analyzing changes in water quantity and disaster prevention resulting from climate warming. Utilizing the dual-frequency ground-penetrating radar developed by the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, in situ observations of glacier thickness distribution were conducted on the Xiaodongkemadi Glacier. Approximately 3500 measurement points were taken along a total length of 2760 meters, covering an elevation range from 5472 to 5636 meters. Based on the measured data, a distribution map of the glacier thickness for Xiaodongkemadi Glacier was created. This map serves as a foundational basis for relevant research on the glacial retreat of Xiaodongkemadi Glacier.",
