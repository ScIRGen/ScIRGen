            "description": "This is Northern Hemispheric (NH) annual near-surface temperature dataset during the past millennium with a 2° spatial resolution, which is produced using the paleoclimate data assimilation approach with EnSRF method, MPI-ESM-P model and 396 multi-proxies from the PAGES2k Consoritum. This dataset agrees well with several observational temperature datasets during the instrumental period, and has a similar level of reliability as the Twentieth Century Reanalysis which assimilates surface pressure observations. In addition, the dataset shows a high level of agreement with previous proxy-based reconstructions (average correlation of annual mean NH temperatures is r = 0.61).  The dataset can be used to study the temperature variability over the NH and some regions of the NH during the past millennium (1000-2000 AD).",

                    "Answer": "The ensemble square root filter algorithm (EnSRF) is a data assimilation method used to integrate model outputs with observational data. In the context of paleoclimate data assimilation, EnSRF combines climate model simulations, specifically using MPI-ESM-P as the model operator, with proxy data to reconstruct past temperature fields. This method helps ensure that the reconstructed temperature fields are consistent with both the model and the observational data, achieving a high degree of accuracy as indicated by a high average correlation coefficient (>0.6) and a significant p-value (<0.01).",

The use of 396 annually resolved proxy records and the MPI-ESM-P model operator helps ensure consistency between reconstructed temperature fields and observed/proxy-derived temperatures, as indicated by the high average correlation coefficient (>0.6, p-value < 0.01).",

This approach yields a good consistency between reconstructed temperature fields and observed temperatures, with an average correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 and a p-value less than 0.01, indicating a strong statistical agreement.",

The goal is to provide a comprehensive dataset with annual resolution and 2° spatial resolution of temperature anomalies, which can be used to study past climate changes on both hemispheric and regional scales. The method involves assimilating 396 annual-resolution proxy records using an ensemble square root filter algorithm (EnSRF) and the MPI-ESM-P model operator, resulting in a reliable dataset with a high average correlation coefficient (>0.6) and statistical significance (p-value < 0.01).",
