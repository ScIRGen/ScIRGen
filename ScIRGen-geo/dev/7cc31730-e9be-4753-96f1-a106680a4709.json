            "description": "The dataset is the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) products from 1980s to 2019 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the MSAVI equation which modifies the problem that SAVI is not sensitive in the dense vegetation area.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.MSAVI is stable in the dense vegetation area, but is not sensitive in the sparse vegetation area .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the MSAVI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the MSAVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI;the MSAVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-MSAVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the MSAVI results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the MSAVI results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "The improved soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) is described as being relatively stable in areas with dense vegetation coverage, allowing for more reliable interpretations of vegetation health and density in such regions. In contrast, it is noted to be less sensitive in areas with sparse vegetation, which could pose challenges in accurately assessing vegetation conditions there. This indicates a potential limitation in data collection, where distinguishing between soil and sparse vegetation might be difficult, thus requiring enhanced processing methods or supplementary datasets to improve sensitivity and accuracy.",

This enhancement allows for more accurate monitoring and analysis of vegetation dynamics over time, from the 1980s to 2019, across the Tibetan Plateau.",
