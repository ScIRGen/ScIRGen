            "description": "The dataset focuses on the distribution of sampling plots and stripes in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas.\n     (1) YKLZYMD-the maize field plot (180m×180m) at Yingke Weather Station\n     It matches No. 10 flight route. Five subplots were selected, including three maize subplots and 2 wheat subplots. The maize subplots, labeled as YKLZYMD01, YKLZYMD02 and YKLZYMD03, were planted in different directions with a ridge sturctrue, which was composed of single row of maizes and bare soils. The distance of adjacent maize rows, as well as the width of bare soil was 0.5m . YKLZYMD05 (2.46m×1m, along the ridge) was located in the northwest of the plot and interplanted with wheat and soy bean. YKLZYMDD06 was exclusively wheat, and 10 rows (1.5m) vertical to the ridge and 1m along the ridge were measured.\n     This is a key experimental area for canopy spectrum, component reflectance spectra, BRDF, albedo, the photosynthetic rate, FPAR, structural parameters, vegetation coverage, the radiative temperature, surface emissivity, atmospheric parameters and soil moisture.\n     (2) YKXMD-Yingke wheat plot (180m×170m)\n     It matches No. 11 flight route. Wheat and maize were interplanted. Three subplots with the same size (3.4m * 3.4m) were selected for the measurement of vegetaion structural parameters, BRDF, the radiative temperature, vegetation coverage and soil moisture.\n     (3) HZZHMZYMD-Huazhaizi maize plot (240m×240m)\n     It is located between No. 9 and No. 10 flight routes. The maize seed dominates, and wheat, alfalfa and tomatoes were planted. 4 maize subplots and one wheat subplot were chosen to collect the canopy temperature, spectrum, structural parameters and vegetation coverage.\n     (4) HZZHMYD1-Huazhaizi desert No. 1 plot (240m×240m)\n     It is located within No. 4 flight route. 3 subplots (30m×30m) were chosen for reflectance spectra, BRDF, vegetation coverage, emissivity, the radiative temperature, soil moisture, atmospheric parameters by sunphotometer CE318 and surface roughness.\n     In cooperation with experiments in Huazhaizi desert plots and Yingke weather station, simultaneous airborne multiangular thermal infrared camera&CCD-ground observations, simultaneous airborne hyperspectral imager (OMIS)-ground observations, simultaneous OMIS/TM/ASTER/Hyperion/CHRIS/ASAR-ground observations were all accomplished.\n     (5) HZZHMYD2-Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot\n     It matches No. 5 flight route. Three subplots (10m×10m) for coverage and the radiative temperature and one (30m×30m) for simultaneous temperature and spectrum were chosen.\n     (6) HZZHMYD3-Huazhaizi desert No. 3 plot (30m×30m)\n     It is an intensive plot without simultaneous airporne or spaceborne measurement.\n     (7) DJCYMYD-the maize field at the resort\n     It is an intensive plot (30m×30m) with the maize seeds, mainly for the measurement of radiative temperature and soil moisture.\n     (8) DJCDMD-the barley field at the resort\n     It is mainly for radiative temperature data.\n     (9) DJCDBC-the calibration field at the resort\n     It is located at the ICBC resort. The reflectance spectra of the basketball court, the pool and the vegetation were collected used for radiative calibration of CCD camera in visible and near infrared spectra range.\n     The dataset also includes geographic infomation of each sample point.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in vegetation cover measurements across different sample plots in oasis and desert environments can be attributed to the distinct surface types and vegetation coverage differences. In the oasis, the primary surface types are seed corn and wheat, while in the desert area, there are bare soil and vegetation like red sand with significant differences in vegetation coverage. The choice of sample plots, such as those in the Yingke Oasis with structured corn and wheat fields versus the bare soil and red sand in the Huazhaizi Desert, directly influences the measurements. Additionally, the method of planting, like the 'mother-father-mother' structure in desert cornfields, also impacts the results.",

For example, canopy spectral data and BRDF are measured using spectrometers and multi-angle cameras. Soil moisture is measured using instruments such as infrared and CCD cameras, especially in the early stages of data collection. Different sample plots like the Yingke Meteorological Station Corn Field and the Huazhai Desert plots utilize these instruments to obtain comprehensive data, including structure parameters and radiation temperature. Additionally, different field sites have specific configurations, such as the 'mother-father-mother' planting structure in cornfields, that guide the placement of instruments and sampling strategies.",
