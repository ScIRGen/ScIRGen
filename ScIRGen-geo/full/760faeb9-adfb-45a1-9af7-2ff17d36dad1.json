            "description": "The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau accumulated a large amount of organic carbon, while its size and response to environmental factors for the whole area remain uncertain. Here, we synthesized a dataset to date with the largest data volume and broadest geographic coverage over the TP, composing of 7196 observations from multiple field campaigns since the 1980s to 2020. Based on this ground sample survey data, a machine learning algorithm was used to generate carbon stocks raster data for plants and soils on the Tibetan Plateau. The data are spatial patterns of different carbon stocks on the Tibetan Plateau, including above-ground biomass carbon stock, below-ground biomass carbon stock, plant carbon stock, and soil organic carbon (0-30cm, 0-100cm, 100-200cm) carbon stocks, with a spatial resolution of 5km and C stock units are kg (C) /m2.",

                    "Answer": "A 'carbon pool dataset' in the context of vegetation and soil research on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau refers to a comprehensive collection of data that quantifies the spatial distribution and magnitude of carbon stored in various components such as aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, plant carbon, and soil organic carbon at different depths (0-30cm, 0-100cm, 100-200cm). This data is typically gathered from extensive ground surveys and is often used to generate high-resolution spatial maps using machine learning algorithms, reflecting the carbon storage patterns across the plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The use of machine learning algorithms allows for the generation of high-resolution raster data that depict the spatial patterns of carbon storage in both vegetation and soil layers. This approach can help interpret how different environmental factors influence carbon distribution across the plateau by identifying patterns and correlations that might not be evident through traditional analysis methods. It also enables the integration of vast and diverse datasets, such as those collected from 7196 sample sites over several decades, enhancing the ability to model carbon storage with greater accuracy and detail.",

                    "Answer": "The uncertainty arises due to the varied spatial distribution of organic carbon across the region, which is influenced by environmental factors. This is addressed by collecting the largest and most geographically comprehensive ground sample data from 7196 sample points, covering a period from the 1980s to 2020, and using machine learning algorithms to generate raster data for carbon stocks.",

                    "Answer": "Using machine learning algorithms to generate vegetation and soil carbon stock maps from extensive ground survey data can lead to more accurate spatial representation of carbon stocks across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This approach allows for the integration of a large dataset with diverse geographic coverage, enhancing the understanding of carbon distribution patterns. Additionally, the high-resolution maps can improve regional carbon budget estimates and inform environmental management and policy decisions. However, there may be challenges in ensuring model accuracy and generalizability due to variability in data quality and environmental conditions over time.",
