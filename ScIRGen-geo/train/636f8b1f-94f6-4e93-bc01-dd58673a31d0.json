            "description": "In 2017, on the basis of detailed petrography and metallogenic stage division, 20 thin sections were selected to delineate the minerals to be tested under the microscope, and the micrographs were taken to find the corresponding mineral points during the experiment. Then the polished wafer was sprayed with carbon, and then the electron probe microanalysis (EMPA) test was carried out. In this paper, the EMPA test was carried out twice, a total of 207 points were tested. Two EPMA analyses were carried out with two different instruments: jeol jxa-8100, State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and jeol jxa-8230, Key Laboratory of minerals and mineralization, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The analysis conditions of jeol jxa-8100 are: 15kV accelerating voltage, diameter of 5 μ M electron beam spot. The analysis conditions of jeol jxa-8120 are: 20kV accelerating voltage, 20na current, 1 μ m。 The major elements of EPMA analysis include as, Fe, Pb, Zn, Cu, Sb and s, and the trace elements include Au, Ag, Se, Co, Bi, Ni, Cu, Sb, Zn, Pt, PD and te. The detection limits of gold for jeol jxa-8100 and jeol jxa-8230 are 409 ppm and 259 ppm respectively.",

This facilitates a detailed understanding of mineralogical and geochemical processes associated with ore formation, aids in the classification of ore-forming stages, and enhances the understanding of the spatial distribution of economically important elements like gold. By employing EMPA, researchers can delineate mineral phases and identify trace elements at micro-scales, which is crucial for mineral exploration, resource assessment, and optimization of mining strategies.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps for conducting EPMA in a mining region involve selecting 20 thin sections based on detailed lithofacies and mineralization phase divisions. Under a microscope, the minerals to be tested are outlined, and photomicrographs are taken to help locate the corresponding mineral points during experiments. The polished thin sections are then coated with carbon and subjected to EPMA testing. The analysis is carried out in two sessions using two different instruments: the JEOL JXA-8100 and the JEOL JXA-8230. The JEOL JXA-8100 operates at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV with a 5 μm electron beam diameter, while the JEOL JXA-8230 operates at a 20 kV accelerating voltage, 20 nA current, and 1 μm beam diameter.
