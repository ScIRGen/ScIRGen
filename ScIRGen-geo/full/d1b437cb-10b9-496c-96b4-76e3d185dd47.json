            "description": "The freeze/thaw status of the near-surface soil is the water-ice phase transition that occurred at the top soil layer. It is an important indicator as a giant on-off “switch” of the land surface processes including water, energy, and carbon exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere. The freeze/thaw status is an essential variable for understanding how the ecosystem responds to and affects global changes. This dataset is based on the AMSR-E and AMSR2 passive microwave brightness temperature data, and the freeze-thaw discriminant function algorithm is used to generate the global near-surface soil freeze-thaw status with a spatial resolution of grids at 0.25° from 2002 to 2019. The dataset can be used for the analysis of the spatial distribution and trend changes of global freeze-thaw cycles, such as the freeze/thaw onset dates and duration. It provides data support for understanding the interaction mechanism between the land surface freeze-thaw cycle and the land-atmosphere exchanges under the context of global changes.",

This alternation signifies the dormant and active phases of land surface processes, influencing soil water and thermal properties, surface runoff, groundwater recharge, and the overall water cycle. Such freeze/thaw cycles, measured using passive microwave brightness temperature data from AMSR-E and AMSR2, affect climate change through their impact on water and energy exchange mechanisms.",

This method allows for the analysis of global near-surface freeze/thaw cycles, including the start/end dates, duration of freezing/thawing, and freezing extent.
