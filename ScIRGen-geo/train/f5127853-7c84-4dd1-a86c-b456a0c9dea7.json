            "description": "The data of birds in Kekexili area of Qinghai Province are from the comprehensive scientific investigation of Kekexili area carried out from May to August 1990. In the composition of birds, all of them are Palaearctic, and the composition of Qinghai Tibet area accounts for a large proportion, reaching as many as 18 species. Kekexili is closely related to the whole plateau in terms of geological structure or physical and geographical conditions, and its bird composition also reflects The correlation is analyzed. On the one hand, the composition of the Qinghai Tibet region accounts for a large proportion; on the other hand, the local habitat formed by its special location is extremely arid, which makes it difficult for the composition of the Qinghai Tibet region to extend into its hinterland; on the other hand, the composition of the Inner Mongolia new area is difficult to adapt due to the high temperature and cold, which makes the bird species, distribution and population in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau extremely low Different from other areas of the plateau, Hoh Xil area has always been an uninhabited area, lacking zoological data, which is conducive to the study of Hoh Xil area.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format and contains three workbooks, which are 1. Bird list of Hoh Xil area in Qinghai 2. Bird species composition and distribution between Hoh Xil area and adjacent areas 3. Comparison of bird composition similarity index between Hoh Xil area and adjacent areas. The table introduces bird list, bird species composition and distribution in Hoh Xil area in detail, and the similarity index is very high Valuable data.",

In the case of Qinghai Kekexili, it indicates the presence of species primarily from the Palearctic realm, with a significant proportion from the Qinghai-Tibet region, combined with the extreme arid and cold conditions that influence the diversity and population density of avian species.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods in the Qinghai Kekexili region in 1990 involved comprehensive scientific surveys that highlighted the challenges of remote and inhospitable environments, such as extreme aridity and cold, which impacted the presence and diversity of bird species. Modern methods might include advanced technologies like satellite imaging, automated recording units, and drone surveys, which could offer more continuous and less intrusive monitoring, potentially increasing the accuracy and scope of data collection in similar challenging environments.",

                    "Answer": "The bird species compositions and their distribution patterns suggest a strong influence of the Qinghai-Tibet region's ecological and geographical factors. The significant proportion of Palaearctic elements, particularly those from the Qinghai-Tibet region, indicates a close relationship between the bird species composition and the area's geological and natural geographical conditions. The unique position of the Kekexili region, characterized by extreme aridity and cold due to its high elevation, results in a simplified avian diversity compared to other areas of the plateau. This suggests that both ecological factors like local climate and geographical isolation due to high altitude play crucial roles in shaping avian biodiversity in this remote region.",

                    "Answer": "The simplicity of bird species and population distribution in the Qinghai Kekexili region during the 1990 study period is attributed to the region's unique environmental conditions, including its high altitude, extreme aridity, and cold climate. These factors create a challenging habitat that limits the diversity and number of bird species, resulting in a simpler assemblage compared to other regions of the Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Given the unique geographic and environmental conditions of the Qinghai Kekexili area, data collection during specific months (May to August) can reveal the significant presence of Palaearctic elements, particularly from the Qinghai-Tibet region. This enhances understanding of how the locality's extreme arid conditions and cold climate influence bird species composition and distribution, offering insights into the simplified zonation of bird species on the Tibetan Plateau compared to other regions.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives for collecting bird species data in the Qinghai Kekexili region during May to August 1990 include understanding the composition of bird species in relation to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's unique ecological conditions. The data aims to reflect the close relationship between Kekexili's bird composition and the geological and natural geographical conditions of the entire high plateau. It highlights the significant presence of Qinghai-Tibet region components, the challenges posed by extreme aridity, and the impact of cold conditions on species adaptation and population distribution. Overall, the goal is to contribute valuable information to the otherwise scarce zoological data about this remote and previously unexplored area.",
