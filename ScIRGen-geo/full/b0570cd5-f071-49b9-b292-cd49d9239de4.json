Within them, the former six images are of HH/VV polarization with low incidence angle (22-24°), while the later two images acquired on 2012-08-14 and 2012-08-25 are of VV/VH polarization with higher incidence angle (39-40°).  \nTerraSAR-X dataset was acquired from German Space Agency (DLR) through the general proposal of “Estimation of eco-hydrological variables using TerraSAR-X data in the Heihe River Basin, China” (project ID: HYD2096).",

The data collection involves capturing images in StripMap mode at a nominal resolution of 3 meters. Specific procedures include utilizing different polarization modes (HH/VV and VV/VH) and varying incidence angles to capture diverse ecological and hydrological features. The data is obtained through a collaboration with the German Aerospace Center under the project ‘Estimation of eco-hydrological variables using TerraSAR-X data in the Heihe River Basin, China’. These procedures facilitate the mapping of eco-hydrological variables, overcoming the limitations of optical imagery in terms of temporal and spatial constraints.",
