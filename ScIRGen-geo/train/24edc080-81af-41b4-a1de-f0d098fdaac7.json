            "description": "The observation data set of L-band ground-based microwave radiometer within Shandian River Basin collects the experimental data of ground-based L-band mobile observation carried out by Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shandian River Basin in September 2018. The L-band microwave radiometer is installed on the lifting platform of Changchun Jingyuetan remote sensing vehicle, and the platform is raised to 5M for dual polarization multi angle observation. The host system of the microwave radiometer system directly stores the data as a .dat file, which can be read and processed by Excel or MATLAB. The collected data has been sorted into excel form.This data can be used to study the inversion method of soil moisture.",
            "instructions": "The data folder is named \"LMW + observation date + observation target\". For example, \"LMW20180927Soil\" represents the L-band soil brightness temperature measured on September 27, 2018. Each folder generally includes three files, one is a scene photo, named \"LMW + observation date + observation target + Scenario. JPG\", and the other is an observation target, It is named \"LMW + observation date + observation target + Target.jpg\", an excel brightness temperature file is named \"LMW + observation date + observation target + TB\", and the internal three columns are H-polarization brightness temperature, v-polarization brightness temperature, pitch, azimuth, longitude and latitude. You can open it directly in Excel or read it in MATLAB.",
