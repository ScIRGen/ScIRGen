Observations were carried out in the reed plot A, the saline plots B and C, the alfalfa plot D, the barley plot E and the temporary farmland on Jun. 10 and 11, 2008 and in plots A, B and E on Jul. 11, 2008.\n    Observation time and the land surface radiative temperature were archived in Word, txt and Excel format. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental of Linze station area for more information.",

This can lead to improved accuracy of surface temperature retrievals by providing a diverse range of calibration and validation data points. The increased variety of land cover types and temporal data can help in fine-tuning the algorithms used for airborne and satellite remote sensing data interpretation, thus enhancing the reliability of temperature retrievals.",

The data collection involves using six instruments, numbered #1 to #6, to measure surface radiation temperature during specific dates in June and July 2008. The challenges in ensuring data accuracy may include maintaining consistent instrument calibration, managing environmental factors that could affect readings, and ensuring precise spatial placement and orientation of the instruments to accurately capture the surface temperature variations.",
