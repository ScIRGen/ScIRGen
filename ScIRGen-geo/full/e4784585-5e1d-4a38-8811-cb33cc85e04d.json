            "description": "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a fragile and starting area of global climate change due to its high altitude difference, cold climate, harsh natural conditions and extremely fragile ecological environment. The research on land reclamation in the historical period of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not only a concrete way to participate in global environmental change, but also provides rich regional information for comprehensive research on land use change, which is of great significance to the research on historical land use/land cover change in China and even the whole world. \"One river and two rivers\" is one of the typical agricultural areas in the farming-pastoral ecotone of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and it is also the area with the most intense land reclamation activities and the fastest population growth in Tibet in the past 1000 years. It is of great significance to fully excavate the rich historical documents in this area and reconstruct the distribution pattern of cultivated land in this area in the past 1000 years, so as to study human land use activities under the background of global climate change. The cultivated land data mainly comes from the General History of Tibet, Research on Tibetan History in Ming Dynasty and Tibet Chronicles.\n",

This dataset aims to contribute to global environmental change research by offering detailed regional information on land use changes. Additionally, it seeks to investigate human land use activities in the context of global climate change by reconstructing the cultivated land distribution over the past 1000 years in a critical agricultural zone of the Tibetan Plateau, which has experienced significant land reclamation and population growth.",
