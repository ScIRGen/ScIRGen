            "description": "Main contents: the continental lithosphere has extensive heterogeneity, but its role in continental rifting is not clear. The effects of lithospheric heterogeneity on the continental rift model are studied using two-dimensional thermo mechanical simulation. Heterogeneity is mainly manifested in the lateral inhomogeneous continental lithosphere, which has a cold western (CW) and a hot Eastern (he) lithosphere. A series of experiments were carried out to explore the influence of lithospheric thermal state, weak zone and extension velocity on continental rift. The main results and implications are as follows: (1) on the he side, the extension of the cwh-e lithosphere always leads to the formation of wide rifts, while the CW side is not deformed（ 2) The existence of weak lithosphere in CW can lead to the formation of wide rift in the East and deep and narrow rift in the West（ 3) The thermal state of the lithosphere strongly influences the rift types and lithospheric deformation patterns. When the crust is extremely hot (tmoho = 900 ℃), a wide rift first appears on the he side, and then a narrow rift forms on the CW side. The extensional velocity mainly affects the time of rift formation, but has no significant effect on the type of rift. Many rift basins developed in the North China Craton (NCC) since the early Cenozoic in response to the subduction and retreat of the Pacific plate. The east of the North China Craton is dominated by wide rifts, while the west of the North China Craton is dominated by narrow rifts. The coexistence of these two types of rifts in the North China Craton is the result of lateral lithospheric heterogeneity, including the pre-existing weak lithospheric regions.",

                    "Answer": "The impact of lateral lithospheric heterogeneity on rift formation patterns is significantly influenced by the thermal state of the lithosphere. The presence of a hotter eastern lithosphere (HE) tends to lead to the formation of wide rifts on the HE side, while the western lithosphere (CW) remains largely undeformed. In cases where the lithosphere is extremely hot (TMoho = 900 ℃), wide rifts form initially on the HE side, followed by narrow rifts on the CW side. These observations suggest that the thermal state heavily affects the type of rift and deformation mode of the lithosphere.",

                    "Answer": "The factors that contribute to challenges in collecting data on lithosphere heterogeneity's impact on continental rifting include the complexity of lateral variation in the lithosphere, such as the presence of a cold western lithosphere and a hot eastern lithosphere. Additionally, understanding the impact of weak zones and variable extension rates on rift formation adds to the complexity. The thermal state of the lithosphere significantly affects rift types and deformation patterns, necessitating precise thermal measurements and simulations. These challenges are compounded by the need to simulate conditions that reflect the real-world geological context, such as those observed in regions like the North China Craton.",

                    "Answer": "The thermal state of the lithosphere strongly affects rift types and deformation patterns. For example, when the crust is extremely hot (TMoho = 900 ℃), wide rifts initially form on the hotter eastern side, followed by narrow rifts on the cooler western side. Thus, incorporating variations in thermal states would likely refine the accuracy of predicted rift formations and lithospheric deformation patterns.",

By using two-dimensional thermo-mechanical simulations, researchers aim to investigate how variations in lithospheric temperature and the presence of weak zones, as well as extension rates, affect rift morphology and deformation patterns. This research seeks to clarify the role of lithospheric heterogeneity in creating different rift types, such as wide and narrow rifts, and to explain the co-existence of these rift types in regions like the North China Craton, which has been influenced by tectonic events such as the retreat of the Pacific Plate.",
