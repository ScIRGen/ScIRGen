The vegetation index NDVI was prepared by using the NOAA-AVHRR data source after radiation correction and geometric rough correction. Every day, each track image is processed with geometric fine correction, removal of bad lines, and removal of clouds, etc., and then NDVI calculation and synthesis. The daily NDVI calculation formula is: 1000 × (b2-b1) / (b2 + b1), where b1 and b2 are the first and second channels of AVHRR.\n         Parameter table of Pathfinder AVHRR\nParameter / Variable Definition Unit Range\nNDVI Normalized Vegetation Index None (-1,1)\nCLAVR identification Cloudiness index from CLAVR algorithm None (0,30)\nQC identification Data quality identification None (0,16)\nScanning angle Sensor angle Radian (-1.05, 1.05)\nSolar zenith angle Solar zenith angle per pixel Radian (0, 1.04)\nRelative zenith angle Relative zenith angle of the sensor Radian (-1.05, 1.05)\nCh1 reflectance Reflectance of the first channel (0.58-0.68um) Percent (0,100)\nCh2 reflectance Reflectivity of the second channel (0.72--1.10um) Percentage (0, 100)\nCh3 brightness temperature Bright temperature value of the third channel (3.55-3.95um) Kelvin temperature scale (160, 340)\nCh4 brightness temperature Brightness value of the fourth channel (10.3-11.3um) Kelvin temperature scale (160, 340)\nCh5 brightness temperature Bright temperature value of the fifth channel (11.5-12.5um) Kelvin temperature scale (160, 340)\n    The data set includes data on NDVI in China's sub-regions from 1981 to June-September 2001, and data on tens of months in each of the years 1982, 1986, 1991, and 1996 (a total of 343 in 84 months, of which 1981 in June 1981).

                "Earth observation-based long-term global vegetation index products are used by scientists from a wide range of disciplines concerned with global change. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is defined as (ρNIR −ρRED)/(ρNIR +ρRED), where ρNIR and ρRED are surface reflectance in the near infrared (NIR; 0.725–1.10 µm) and visible red (0.58–0.68 µm), respectively. As plants become more photoactive, they absorb more visible red light due to the chlorophyll content of leaves and stems, and scatter more in the near infrared due to the alignment of cell walls. This relationship, detected by remote sensing instruments at the canopy scale, has the effect of making the index increase (decrease) as the density of the canopy increases (decreases). As such, NDVI has been used widely in global change research with Earth observation remote sensing for three general purposes: (1) the estimation of canopy properties related to light-use efficiency, such as the leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (FPAR), (2) representation of vegetation climatology in soil–vegetation–atmosphere transfer models, and (3) detection of trends in vegetation and phenology. Although NDVI is widely used, it is sensitive to atmospheric effects, soil background, and saturates at high LAI. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was introduced to overcome these limitations, as it includes a visible blue band to reduce atmospheric effects, calibration terms to reduce the effects of soil background, and does not saturate as severely as NDVI at high LAI. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is the most commonly used sensor for long-term (i.e. pre-MODIS) global change studies, because it began retrieving visible red and NIR reflectance needed to estimate NDVI from 1981. Reflectance data collected from the earlier AVHRR sensors were difficult to process and synthesize, because they lacked onboard calibration; the NIR channel was sensitive to water, sun glint, glaciers at high latitudes, and clouds; and of orbital drift. These issues were rectified with the launch of the AVHRR sensors onboard NOAA 16, 17, 18, and 19, but have resulted in radiometric and spectral inconsistencies across sensors that can significantly bias global change analyses. Various methods have been developed to make these data continuous and consistent through time, but take different approaches and are frequently updated, necessitating new accuracy assessments to inform the user community as they evolve. The Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) and Vegetation Index and Phenology Lab (VIP) AVHRR products are actively used and frequently updated, but represent fundamentally different approaches to synthesis. Both GIMMS and VIP are aggregated to a 15-day time step from daily data and are calibrated with higher spatial resolution sensors in the period that overlaps NOAA 7, 9, 11, and 14 and NOAA 16, 17, 18, and 19."

In doing so, we helped resolve the superiority of one product over another. The assessment was performed with three experiments that address the three major themes of global change research that involve Earth observation remote sensing."

                "After the filter was applied, NDVI3g was resampled to NDVI3v/EVI3v resolution using the gdalwarp utility (http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html) with default parameters. The data sets were then resampled back to the native NDVI3g spatial resolution for evaluation. FPAR derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper/The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM +) 30 m resolution surface reflectance data was used intermediately to downscale NDVI3g, NDVI3v, and EVI3v to 30 m resolution to facilitate the comparison. The Landsat TM/ETM+surface reflectance and in situ LAI data were extracted from a database that was developed to determine the ability of Landsat-based NDVI, EVI2, and other vegetation indices to predict LAI for field crops around the world. NDVI and EVI2 were computed using the equations above. Downscaling was performed by converting AVHRR and Landsat vegetation indices to FPAR. In this study, on a per pixel basis, most of the in situ LAI was retrieved only once, so using a ratio-based approach was not feasible. Therefore, the AVHRR vegetation indices were downscaled to 30 m spatial resolution by regressing (linearly) Landsat FPAR and NDVI3g, NDIV3v, and EVI3v FPAR. Once NDVI3g, NDVI3v, and EVI3v FPAR were downscaled to corresponding Landsat data, their performance was evaluated by regressing them (linearly) with the in situ LAI data. The performance of the final model selected in each case was characterized by the coefficient of determination (R2), significance tests, and root mean square error (RMSE)."

                    "Question": "Please discuss the types of datasets or data sources that can be utilized to enhance the accuracy and reliability of vegetation index studies, particularly in the context of long-term environmental monitoring.",
                    "Answer": "Datasets that can enhance vegetation index studies include high-resolution Landsat TM/ETM+ surface reflectance data and in situ LAI databases. These can be used to downscale and validate AVHRR-derived indices, improving accuracy and reliability. Additionally, meteorological data such as air temperature, precipitation, and ground temperature can provide context for analyzing temporal and spatial variations in vegetation indices.",
