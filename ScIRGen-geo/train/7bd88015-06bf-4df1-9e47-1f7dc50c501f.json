            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of 10m tower vortex correlator on January 1, 2016, solstice, 2016, December 31, 2016.The station is located in east garden town, huailai county, hebei province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7880E, 40.3491N, and the altitude is 480m.The acquisition frequency of vortex correlativity instrument is 10Hz, the frame height is 5m, the ultrasonic direction is due to the north, and the distance between the ultrasonic anometer (CSAT3) and the CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500A) is 15cm.\n\nThe released data is the 30-minute data obtained from the post-processing of the original collected 10Hz data with Eddypro software. The main steps of the processing include: outfield value elimination, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output after processing was also screened :(1) the data when the instrument was wrong was removed;(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation were excluded;(3) the missing rate of 10Hz original data is more than 10% every 30min;(4) the observed data of weak turbulence at night were excluded (u* less than 0.1m/s).The average period of observation data was 30 minutes, 48 data a day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.On May 27, BBB 0, July 22, there was a problem with the ultrasonic anemometer, and the data was missing.\n\nThe observation data released by vortex correlator include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (K), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), the length of cloth hoff, sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest are 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\n\nGuo et al, 2020 is used for site introduction and Liu et al, 2013 for data processing。",

These methods help correct for instrument-related biases and atmospheric conditions, leading to more reliable estimates of heat, water vapor, and CO2 fluxes. However, improper application or over-correction can introduce errors, emphasizing the need for careful application and validation of these techniques to ensure data integrity.",

Quality evaluation involves tests for atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data filtering includes removing erroneous instrument data, excluding data 1 hour before and after precipitation, eliminating data with more than 10% missing in each 30-minute segment, and discarding nighttime weak turbulence data (u* less than 0.1m/s).",

The processing involves several steps including outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation (dual rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. Quality evaluation of flux values is also conducted, focusing on atmospheric stability and turbulent similarity characteristics.
