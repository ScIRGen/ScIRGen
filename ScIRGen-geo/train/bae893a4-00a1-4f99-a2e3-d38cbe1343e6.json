            "description": "Based on the non survey method, referring to the provincial input-output table and county-level statistical data of the Qilian Mountain region, the project compiled the input-output table of the Qilian Mountain Region in 2017. This table provides a data basis for analyzing the production and consumption of regional economy and the virtual water resources contained in its products or services. The input-output table uses the input-output tables of Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Gansu Province in 2017, analyzes the industrial production, residents' consumption and interregional trade information of districts and counties included in the Qilian Mountains, and constructs the input-output table of the Qilian Mountains. The input-output table is the characterization of the regional macroeconomic structure and the level of regional products or services.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of constructing regional input-output tables, 'non-survey method' refers to the approach of utilizing existing data sources, such as provincial input-output tables and county-level statistical data, instead of collecting new data through surveys. This method was used to compile the 2017 input-output table for the Qilian Mountain region by integrating data from Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Gansu Province, to analyze industry production, resident consumption, and inter-regional trade information.",

                    "Answer": "The use of non-survey methods in constructing the input-output table for the Qilian Mountain region leverages existing provincial and county-level input-output tables from Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu Province. This approach allows for the integration of industrial production, resident consumption, and inter-regional trade information to create a comprehensive regional input-output table. While survey-based methods might offer more granular and updated data, the non-survey approach provides a practical and resource-efficient way to analyze regional economic structures and virtual water resources embedded in products and services.",

It may also introduce challenges related to data accuracy, as it relies heavily on existing regional input-output tables and county-level statistical data from Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Gansu Province.
