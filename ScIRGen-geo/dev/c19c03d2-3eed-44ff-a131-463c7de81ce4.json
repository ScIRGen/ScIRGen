            "description": "The data set includes: latitude and longitude, lithological information, chronological data and O isotopic composition, major and trace elements and Sr Nd isotopic composition of Permian Triassic basalt, diorite, granodiorite and granite samples in Ailaoshan structural belt, Yunnan Province. The chronological data of rock samples are determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of magmatic zircon separated from single rock ore. during the testing process, Qinghu standard zircon is used as the monitoring sample to monitor the reliability of the whole analysis and testing process. The main elements were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) by melting the rock powder into a glass sheet which can be tested on the computer. The analytical accuracy of the standard materials gbw-07111, gbw-123, gsr-1, gsr-2 and gsr-3 was better than 2%; Trace elements were analyzed by Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the process of analysis and test, USGS reference materials (bhvo-2, avg-2, gsr-1, gsr-2, gsr-3, gsd-9 and sarm-4) were determined. As the external test standard, the element content of the test sample was more accurate than 3%. The oxygen isotope data are obtained by SIMS of detrital zircon. The external accuracy of the multiple determination results of Penglai standard sample is better than 0.30 ‰ (2 σ，  n = 24)。 The SR Nd isotopic compositions of rocks were determined by the Neptune multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) using nbs987 (87Sr / 86Sr = 0.71025) and shin Etsu jndi-1 (143Nd / 144Nd = 0.512115) as reference materials. The geochronological data, zircon O isotope, whole rock major and trace elements and Sr Nd isotope of the Late Permian NB rich basalts can be used to indicate the interaction between the Paleo Tethys Ailao ocean subduction and the Emeishan mantle plume, and are published in the international well-known journal Geophysical Research Letters. The zircon chronological data, zircon O isotope, whole rock major and trace elements and Sr Nd isotope of diorite granodiorite are used to trace the eastward subduction of the Paleo Tethys Ailaoshan ocean, which provides new evidence for the eastward subduction of the ocean basin and is published in the international well-known Journal LITHOS. The geochronological data, zircon HF-O isotopic data, whole rock major and trace data and Sr Nd isotopic data of the A-type granites obtained can be used to indicate the interaction process between the Ailao Mountain subduction and the Emeishan mantle plume, and published in the world-famous journal GSA bulletin.",

                    "Answer": "The geochemical data collection using SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) for zircon age dating is focused on obtaining precise age information through zircon mineral analysis, with accuracy monitored using the Qinghu standard zircon. This method is highly accurate, with external precision better than 0.30‰(2σ, n = 24) for oxygen isotopes, which is crucial for understanding the temporal aspect of magmatic processes. In contrast, the MC-ICP-MS (Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) method for Sr-Nd isotope analysis involves dissolving rock powder to evaluate isotopic compositions, using standards like NBS987 and Shin Etsu JNdi-1 to ensure accuracy. This method achieves better than 3% precision in element content analysis and provides insights into the source and evolution of magmas by examining isotopic signatures, which are key for understanding interactions such as subduction and mantle plume processes.",
