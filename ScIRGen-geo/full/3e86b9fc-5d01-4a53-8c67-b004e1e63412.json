            "description": "This data is Rb- Sr isochron age data of pyrite in Guocheng gold deposit, Jiaodong. The samples are from the middle section of -220 of Guocheng gold mine. The lithology of the samples is pyritized cataclastic rock with quartz vein. The pyrite is in bright yellow lump shape and have euhedral-subhedral grain structure. The selection of single mineral pyrite was completed in Hebei Institute of regional geological survey. The Rb-Sr content and isotope ratio of pyrite were determined in Institute of soil science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data were obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in the Chinese journal called “Geology in China”, and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can accurately determine the metallogenic age of Guocheng gold deposit and provide reliable chronological data for further study of the regional mineralization.",

                    "Answer": "Rb-Sr isochron dating is a radiometric dating method used to determine the age of mineral samples. In the context of mineral age determination, it involves measuring the ratios of rubidium (Rb) and strontium (Sr) isotopes in a mineral, such as pyrite, and plotting these ratios on an isochron diagram to calculate the time since the mineral crystallized. This method provides reliable chronological data, essential for understanding the formation age of mineral deposits.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in the Rb-Sr isotopic data during the collection process could be caused by several factors, including the precision of mineral selection at the regional geological survey institute, the accuracy of Rb-Sr content and isotopic ratio measurements conducted at the Nanjing Institute of Soil Research, and the analysis techniques employed, such as MC-ICP-MS. Additionally, sample contamination or alteration during extraction from the ore, inconsistencies in the pyrite's crystallographic structure, or errors during measurement could also lead to variations.",

This is conducted using MC-ICP-MS analysis at the Nanjing Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The selection of pyrite samples is completed at the Hebei Regional Geological Survey Research Institute. These methods are designed to yield precise and accurate age data, which can then be used to determine the mineralization age of the Guocheng gold deposit, providing reliable chronological data for further research on the area's mineralization processes.",
