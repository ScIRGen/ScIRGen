The spatial resolution is 100 m and the time resolution is 15 min. The datased can be used in the fields of ecological hydrology and remote sensing research. Using the observed solar radiation at several automatic weather stations in the upper reaches of Heihe River, the accuracy of the calculation results is verified. Results show that the dataset can accurately capture the temporal and spatial changes of the topographic shadow at the stations, and the time error is within 20 minutes.",
