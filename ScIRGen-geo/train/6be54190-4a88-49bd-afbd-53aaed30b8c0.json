Based on the evaluation of the suitability of human settlements, the limitation of resource carrying capacity and socio-economic adaptability, and according to the research idea and technical route of \"suitability zoning restrictive classification adaptability classification warning classification\", a three-dimensional tetrahedral model for the comprehensive evaluation of resource and environmental carrying capacity with balanced significance is constructed. Based on the 10km grid, a comprehensive study on the resource and environment carrying capacity was carried out, and the resource and environment carrying capacity index of the areas along the silk road was quantitatively simulated. Taking 1 as the equilibrium significance, it provided support for the comprehensive evaluation of the resource and environment carrying capacity of the areas along the silk road.",

Firstly, it is based on the evaluation of human habitat suitability, resource carrying constraints, and socio-economic adaptability. The process follows a research approach that transitions from classification to integration, adhering to a methodology of 'suitability zoning—constraint classification—adaptability grading—warning grading.' This model is designed to provide a balanced-state meaning for the comprehensive evaluation of resource and environmental carrying capacity, using a 10-kilometer grid as the foundation. It quantitatively simulates the resource and environmental carrying index along the Silk Road regions, with the index value of 1 indicating a balanced state. This model supports the comprehensive evaluation of resource and environmental carrying capacity in these regions.",
