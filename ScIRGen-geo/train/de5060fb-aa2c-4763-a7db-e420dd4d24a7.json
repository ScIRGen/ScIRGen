            "description": "The thermal state of permafrost in the present and future is fundamental to the ecosystem, hydrological process, carbon exchange, and infrastructure in cold regions. From 2011, we began to establish a permafrost monitoring network along the China-Russia crude oil pipelines (CRCOPs) route at the eastern flank of the northern Da Xing'anling Mountains in Northeast China. Based on meteorological data near the southern limit of latitudinal permafrost (SLLP), ground temperature data in 20 boreholes with the depths of 10–60.6 m, soil volumetric liquid water contents and 2-D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data, we compiled an integrated dataset of the ground thermal state along the CRCOPs route. Study results demonstrate that permafrost in the vicinity of SLLP has experienced marked warming (2011–2020) to climate change, manifested as the rising permafrost temperatures at depth. Local thermal disturbances triggered by the construction and operation of CRCOPs have resulted in significant permafrost warming and subsequent thawing on the right-of-way (ROW) of the pipeline. This permafrost thaw will persist, but it can be alleviated by adopting mitigative measures, such as insulation layer and thermosyphons. The in-situ observational dataset is of great value for assessing the variability of permafrost under the linear disturbances of the CRCOPs and related environmental effects, for understanding hydro-thermal-mechanical interactions between the buried pipelines and permafrost foundation soils, and for evaluating the operational and structural integrity of the pipeline systems in the future.",
