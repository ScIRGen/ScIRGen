            "description": "Contents: 1) data: based on 3180 occurrences of freshwater amphipods from the Tibetan plateau and its surrounding areas, niche simulation studies were performed to explore the historical dynamics and future changes in suitable areas; 2) data sources and processing methods: based on field investigation and existing data of amphipods from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, ecological niche modeling will be used to predict the suitable areas during the last glaciation (LGM), the Holocene (Mid - Holocene), present and future; 3) data quality description: sample collection and longitude and latitude, altitude information are checked to ensure the quality of data distribution, and analysis personnel are trained in laboratory;4) data application results and prospects: the results show that suitable area in LGM would be larger than that of warm period of the middle Miocene; and future climate changes may restrict the distribution of alpine-lake amphipods in the high altitude or high latitudes in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Ecological niche modeling refers to a research approach that involves using distribution point data of a species, such as amphipods in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas, to study the historical dynamics and predict future changes in suitable habitats. This method often relies on field surveys and existing data compilation to predict species distribution during different climatic periods like the Last Glacial Maximum, the Mid-Holocene, the present, and future scenarios.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection techniques for mapping historical and future distribution dynamics of amphipods in the Tibetan Plateau involve using ecological niche modeling based on 3180 distribution points obtained from field surveys and existing data. This approach allows for predictions of suitable habitat areas during different climatic periods. In comparison, traditional field survey methods might focus on current distribution without the predictive capability provided by ecological niche modeling, which can enhance accuracy and comprehensiveness by incorporating historical and future scenarios.",

                    "Question": "What can be inferred about the climatic and environmental factors influencing species distribution patterns from the historical and projected changes in a dataset of amphipods in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas?",
                    "Answer": "The dataset reveals that the distribution of amphipods was larger during colder climates like the Last Glacial Maximum compared to warmer periods such as the Mid-Holocene. This suggests that climatic conditions, such as temperature, play a significant role in determining suitable habitats. It also predicts that future climate warming might cause the distribution to shift towards higher altitudes and latitudes, indicating a sensitivity of species distribution to temperature changes.",

                    "Answer": "The differences in the distribution of amphipods are caused by climatic changes over time, as these changes affect the suitable habitats for amphipods. For instance, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the suitable distribution area was larger due to colder climates, whereas warmer periods like the Mid-Holocene resulted in smaller suitable areas. Future climate warming is predicted to cause a shift in distribution towards higher altitudes and latitudes by 2070.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve conducting field surveys and organizing existing data to gather distribution point data of Gammarus species. This data collection is followed by ecological niche modeling to predict suitable habitats during different time periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Mid-Holocene, present, and future. The quality of the data is ensured by verifying the samples along with their latitude, longitude, and altitude information. All analysts involved undergo rigorous laboratory training to maintain data accuracy.",
