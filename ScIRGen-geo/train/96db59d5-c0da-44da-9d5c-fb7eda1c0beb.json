            "description": "The data can reveal the carbon budget, species composition and productivity of grassland ecosystems with different degradation degrees under extreme climate (extreme drought and extreme rainfall) stress. In this study, the grassland ecosystems with different degradation degrees were monitored in situ for three years from May to September (plant growing season) in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. After the experiment, three-year data of carbon flux, species composition and community productivity of grassland ecosystems with different degradation degrees were obtained, and the data were sorted, mapped and analyzed statistically. The significance of this study is to understand the response of different degraded grassland to extreme climate, evaluate and predict grassland function and succession direction, and provide reference for grassland adaptive management under the background of frequent extreme climate and serious grassland degradation Theoretical support.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods in this field involve in situ monitoring over a three-year period during the plant growing season, specifically from May to September of 2018, 2019, and 2020. This approach allows researchers to observe the impacts of extreme drought and rainfall on carbon balance, species composition, and productivity across grassland ecosystems with varying degrees of degradation.

The study involves a 3-year in-situ monitoring period from May to September, which aligns with the plant growing season, aimed at understanding how these ecosystems respond to climate extremes and providing theoretical support for adaptive grassland management.",

These ecosystems may exhibit different responses to extreme drought and rainfall, which could impact their ecological stability and functionality. Monitoring these changes over time, particularly during the growing season from May to September, can provide insights into how degraded grasslands respond to climate stressors, aiding in the assessment and prediction of grassland functions and succession trends.",
