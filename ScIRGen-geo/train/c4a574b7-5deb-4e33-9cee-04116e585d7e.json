            "description": "It has been a difficult problem to explore the mechanism of geomorphic influence on the distribution pattern of trees in Qinghai Tibet Plateau, and how to show the geomorphic influence more accurately. According to the field and literature survey, it is found that under the better terrain shelter, both the growth of arbor and shrub vegetation has a positive effect. This effect mainly includes the sheltering of wind by terrain and the increase of soil moisture and air humidity by terrain water accumulation. In this study, 250mdem is used to simulate the effect of vegetation occlusion, which is called Topographic Sheltering Index (TSI). C language is used to program and calculate the cumulative horizontal angle of obstacles at the target point. The judgment condition of obstacles is that the distance between the obstacles and the target point is less than 15-20 times of the height difference between the obstacles and the target point, and the multiple is adjustable, which is selected as 15 times according to the actual situation of the plateau, Taking 8km as the search radius and 10 degrees as the search angle), the Topographic Sheltering Index of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is obtained.",

                    "Answer": "The Topographic Sheltering Index (TSI) is a measure used to model the effect of terrain on vegetation distribution, specifically on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It simulates the sheltering effect provided by terrain features by calculating the cumulative horizontal angle of obstacles around a target point. The obstacles are defined as points where the distance between the obstacle and the target is less than 15 times the height difference between them. The TSI uses a 250m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and considers a search radius of 8km and a search angle of 10 degrees. This index accounts for terrain's role in wind sheltering and moisture retention, which positively impacts both tree and shrub vegetation growth.",

                    "Answer": "The Topographic Sheltering Index (TSI) utilizes a 250m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to simulate topographic influences on vegetation by calculating the cumulative horizontal angles of obstacles. This method specifically focuses on terrain's sheltering effects against wind and its role in enhancing soil moisture and air humidity through water accumulation. Other methods might use different criteria or models to assess terrain influences, potentially focusing on factors like elevation, aspect, or slope without accounting for the specific sheltering effects modeled by TSI.",
