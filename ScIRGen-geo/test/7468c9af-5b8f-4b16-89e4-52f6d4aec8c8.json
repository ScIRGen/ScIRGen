                    "Answer": "The challenges in collecting and standardizing historical and field survey data for lakes larger than 1km2 in China are mainly due to the need to organize historical data and actual field survey materials into a standardized format. This involves various regions such as Qinghai, Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and others, which can have differing data collection practices and environmental conditions.",

                    "Answer": "Using historical data and actual field survey data allows for a comprehensive and standardized dataset that includes a wide range of information, such as chemical types, geographical boundaries, and development status of salt lakes. This approach can lead to a more accurate understanding of changes and trends in salt lake characteristics over time. It can also enhance data reliability and accessibility for researchers, given the dataset’s open and shared nature, while presenting challenges in ensuring consistency across different data sources and time periods.",

This is achieved by standardizing historical data and actual field survey materials, aiming to provide comprehensive, open-access data for research and analysis.",
