            "description": "We constructed a set of literature datasets through extracting the observation data from peer-review articles about the forest water storage capacity in the canopy, litter, and soil layer. The data mainly included: (1) literature background information (author, publication year, title); (2) study area (continent, country, latitude); (3) terrain factors (elevation, slope); (4) climatic factors (mean annual temperature, mean annual evapotranspiration); (5) forest attribute factors (stand age, tree height, diameter at breast height, stand density, canopy density, vegetation coverage, leaf area index, interception rate); (6) litter characteristics (litter thickness, litter mass); (7) soil physical properties (capillary porosity, non-capillary porosity). Data extraction and collection steps were as follows: first, we searched the above data keywords in CNKI and Web of Science database, then screened 259 peer-reviewed articles published in 1967-2019 and summarized the information of literature and study area and the water storage observation data of different forest layers, and finally established the literature database. The data were extracted from 1288 global observations, with the observation year of 1964-2017, of which 90.94% of the data were observed from 1990-2017. This dataset provides basic data for the calibration of terrestrial hydrological models and the analysis of factors affecting forest water storage at the global scale. It is helpful to generate global benchmark products that can modify the large-scale models and reduce the model errors, so as to more accurately simulate and predict the water storage capacity of forest ecosystems from point to space.",

This method provides foundational data for calibrating global-scale hydrological models and analyzing factors influencing forest water retention. The extensive observational data, primarily concentrated between 1990-2017, aids in generating global benchmark products for model correction, potentially reducing large-scale model errors and enhancing the accuracy of simulating and predicting forest ecosystem water retention capacity from local to global scales.",
