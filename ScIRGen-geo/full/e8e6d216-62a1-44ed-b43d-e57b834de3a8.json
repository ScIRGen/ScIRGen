            "description": "The data includes 30 items of data in four categories: basic information, comprehensive economy, agriculture and industry, education, health and social security in Qinghai Province and Tibet Autonomous Region. It covers the basic data reflecting human activities, such as population, employees, industrial output value, agricultural machinery power, facility agriculture, etc. of the main county administrative units of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The data are sorted out according to the statistical yearbook data of China's counties from 2001 to 2018. For the convenience of application, the data of Qinghai and Tibet are independently tabulated and included in the data of each year. The data can be used to analyze human activities and social and economic development in the county, as well as agricultural and rural development and change process.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection covers various aspects such as basic demographics, economic activity, agriculture, industry, education, health, and social security across the counties in Qinghai and Tibet. Challenges may arise from diverse factors including the vast and difficult terrain of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the varying levels of infrastructure development, and the complexity of accurately capturing socio-economic indicators across different administrative units. Additionally, ensuring the consistency and reliability of data over an extended period poses significant challenges.",

                    "Answer": "Using county-level administrative units allows for a detailed analysis of human activities and socio-economic development, as it provides granular data on population, employment, industrial output, agricultural machinery power, and facility agriculture. This approach can reveal trends and patterns specific to each county, enabling targeted analysis and policy-making. However, it might also lead to challenges such as data consistency and comparability across different counties, especially given the diverse geographic and socio-economic conditions of Qinghai and Tibet. Moreover, the granularity might obscure broader regional trends that transcend administrative boundaries.",

By using county-level administrative units as the basic statistical unit, the data aims to reflect human activities such as population size, employment, industrial output, agricultural machinery power, and facility agriculture. These insights can be used to assess the process of social and economic development in the region, as well as changes in agriculture and rural development.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection involves compiling information from the China County Statistical Yearbooks from 2001 to 2018. The data is organized by independently creating tables for Qinghai and Tibet, with county-level administrative units serving as the basic statistical entities. This process enables the analysis of human activities and socio-economic development in these regions.",
