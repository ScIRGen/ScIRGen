            "description": "The data are radioisotope dating data of ore bearing porphyry, major and trace geochemical data of whole rock and major and trace geochemical data of minerals. The samples were collected from the ore bearing granite porphyry of the Xietongmen Cu – Au deposit I and II in the Gangdise belt, southern Tibet. The U-Pb isotopic data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major geochemical data of apatite minerals were obtained by electron microprobe analysis, and the minor data of apatite and zircon minerals were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The geochemical characteristics and redox state of the ore bearing porphyry can be defined by the obtained data",
            "instructions": "All data are stored in Excel file. The file name \"UPB. XLS\" represents radioisotope data. The name of the file \"wrmajtra\" represents the major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock. The file name \"apatite maj\" represents the data of major elements in apatite. The file name \"apatitetra\" represents apatite trace element data. The file name \"zircon tra\" represents zircon trace element data.",

                    "Answer": "For zircon U-Pb isotopic analysis, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is used, which offers high precision in dating geological samples by analyzing zircon minerals. This method is particularly effective for providing accurate radiometric ages. In contrast, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) for whole-rock major trace geochemistry is more focused on determining the elemental composition of the rocks, providing broader geochemical data. While LA-ICP-MS is precise for isotopic dating and understanding the temporal aspects of mineralization, XRF is crucial for assessing the overall geochemical characteristics and magmatic processes influencing the mineralized porphyry. Both methods complement each other in offering a comprehensive understanding of the geochemical characteristics and magmatic oxidation state.",

                    "Answer": "Using LA-ICP-MS for analyzing zircon U-Pb isotopes and mineral trace elements allows for precise age determination and detailed geochemical profiling, which can enhance the understanding of geochemical characteristics and the magmatic oxidation state of the ore-bearing porphyries. This method could lead to more accurate characterizations of the mineralization processes and the evolution of the magmatic systems in the southern Tibet Gangdese belt.",
