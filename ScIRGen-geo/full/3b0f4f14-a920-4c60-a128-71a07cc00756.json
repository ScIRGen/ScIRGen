            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Alpine meadow and grassland ecosystem Superstation superstation eddy covariance system (EC) belonging to the Qinghai Lake basin integrated observatory network from January 1 to October 31 in 2021. The site (98°35′41.62″E, 37°42′11.47″N) was located in the alpine meadow and alpine grassland ecosystem, near the SuGe Road in Tianjun County, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3718m. The EC was installed at a height of 4.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3A &EC150) was about 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Data during December 18 to December 24, 2018 were missing due to the data collector failure.\nThe released data contained the following variables: DATE/TIME, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). The quality marks of sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and carbon flux are divided into three levels (quality marks 0 have good data quality, 1 have good data quality and 2 have poor data quality). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format.

                    "Answer": "An eddy covariance system is a set of instruments, including an ultrasonic anemometer and a CO2/H2O analyzer, used to measure and analyze turbulent fluxes of gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor in the atmosphere. In high-altitude regions, it is mounted at a specific height, such as 4.5 meters, to capture data at a frequency of 10Hz. The raw data undergo processing steps like spike removal, delay time correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and density corrections. These processed data help in understanding the surface-atmosphere exchanges in mixed grasslands, such as those found in the Qinghai Lake region.",

                    "Answer": "The data processing technique using Eddypro software involves steps like outlier removal, delay time correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, virtual temperature correction, and density correction. It also includes quality evaluation of flux values based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity tests, and filtering out data based on instrument errors, rain events, and data completeness. These steps are critical in ensuring data quality and might differ from other methods in the level of detail and types of corrections applied.",

                    "Answer": "The dataset provides insights into atmospheric dynamics by capturing turbulent flux data such as sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and carbon dioxide flux. The use of an eddy covariance system with high temporal resolution (10Hz) and subsequent data processing (e.g., coordinate rotation, frequency response correction) allows for detailed observation of energy and mass exchange processes between the surface and atmosphere. These patterns can indicate how atmospheric stability, turbulence similarity characteristics, and surface-atmosphere interactions are influenced by environmental conditions in high-altitude meadow and grassland areas.",

                    "Answer": "To ensure the quality and accuracy of the data collected from high-altitude meadow and grassland areas, various steps are followed using specific technologies. The data is collected using an eddy covariance system, which includes a CSAT3A ultrasonic anemometer and an EC150 CO2/H2O analyzer, mounted at a height of 4.5 meters with a sampling frequency of 10Hz. The original data is then processed using Eddypro software to produce 30-minute averaged data. Key processing steps include outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation (double rotation), frequency response correction, sonic temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. Quality assessment of flux values is conducted through tests on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics. Additionally, 30-minute flux data is filtered to remove erroneous data from instrument errors, exclude data within an hour before and after precipitation events, and discard any 30-minute data with a greater than 10% data gap from the original 10Hz dataset. The processed data includes various parameters with quality identifiers categorized into three levels, indicating data quality from good to poor.",
