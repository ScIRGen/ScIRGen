            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Qinghai Lake integrated observatory network obtained from an observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Yulei station on Qinghai lake from Janurary 1 to December 31, 2021. The site (100° 29' 59.726'' E, 36° 35' 27.337'' N) was located on the Yulei Platform in Erlangjian scenic area, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3209m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP155; 12 and 12.5 m above the water surface, towards north), wind speed and direction profile (windsonic; 14 m above the water surface, towards north) , rain gauge (TE525M; 10m above the water surface in the eastern part of the Yulei platform ), four-component radiometer (NR01; 10 m above the water surface, towards south), one infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 10 m above the water surface, towards south, vertically downward), photosynthetically active radiation (LI190SB; 10 m above the water surface, towards south), water temperature profile (109, -0.2, -0.5, -1.0, -2.0, and -3.0 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_12 m, Ta_12.5 m; RH_12 m, RH_12.5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_14 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_14 m) (°) , precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1) (℃), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (μmol/ (s m-2)), water temperature (Tw_20cm、Tw_50cm、Tw_100cm、Tw_200cm、Tw_300cm) (℃).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. As the lake water freezes in winter, the water temperature probe is withdrawn, so there is no water temperature data record during October 19, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2018-1-1 10:30. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.",

This caused data to be available only from January 1 to May 29, 2021, resulting in missing data from May 30 to December 31, 2021.",

Additionally, equipment like water temperature probes are retracted during freezing conditions, leading to periods without temperature data.",
