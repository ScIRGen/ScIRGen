This concept is crucial in understanding how desert plants like Tamarix, Nitraria, and Reaumuria adapt to arid environments by leveraging atmospheric moisture. The study of this process involves collecting data on liquid flow and environmental variables such as meteorological conditions, photosynthesis, fluorescence, and leaf surface humidity, as well as genetic transcriptome and expression regulation data.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in collecting accurate environmental and physiological data for desert plants such as Tamarix and Salsola in arid regions may arise from factors like harsh weather conditions, which can affect sensor performance and data integrity. Additionally, the remote locations of field sites in areas like Gansu's Jingtai County and Ejina Banner can pose logistical difficulties in accessing and maintaining equipment. Variability in plant responses to environmental stressors, such as changes in humidity and temperature, can also complicate data collection and interpretation.",
