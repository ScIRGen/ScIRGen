        "Today most glaciers outside the polar regions are retreating at accelerating rates. This retreat is particularly evident in the high Andes of Peru, which contain 70% of the Earth’s tropical glaciers. Because of its dome shape, Quelccaya is very sensitive to the current increase in the elevation of the 0°C isotherm, and it loses more mass per unit rise in the equilibrium line than steeper alpine glaciers. The chemical and physical properties preserved within glaciers and ice caps also record climatic and environmental changes that provide a longer-term context for 20th-century changes. Strong linkages have been demonstrated between sea-surface temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean and δ18O in ice cores from the tropical Andes and the Himalaya. Although not fully resolved, the weight of available empirical evidence, including that presented in Fig. 5, strongly suggests that on longer time scales, δ18O variations in low-latitude mountain precipitation reflect variations in air temperature more strongly than variations in precipitation."

        "The retreat of Quelccaya’s largest outlet glacier, Qori Kalis, has been evaluated by terrestrial photogrammetry since 1978. In 2003, a new ice core was drilled to bedrock on the summit of Quelccaya, but this time it was returned frozen to Byrd Polar Research Center, where concentrations of dust and various chemical species and the stable isotopic ratios were measured. The annual average δ18O values for the 1983 Quelccaya core, measured on bottled water from samples cut and melted in the field, are compared with those for the 2003 Quelccaya core, which were returned frozen to Ohio State University, allowing freshly cut samples to be analyzed."

        "The three lines of evidence argue that the present warming and associated glacier retreat are unprecedented in some areas for at least 5,200 yr. The ongoing global-scale, rapid retreat of mountain glaciers is not only contributing to global sea-level rise but also threatening freshwater supplies in many of the world’s most populous regions. The recently exposed plant deposit provides strong evidence that temperatures were warmer in this region before 5.1 thousand years (ka) B.P. and that the current retreat of Quelccaya is unprecedented for the last 5 millennia. The evidence presented here indicates that rising air temperature (not reduced precipitation) is the primary driver of glacier retreat in the tropics and subtropics."
