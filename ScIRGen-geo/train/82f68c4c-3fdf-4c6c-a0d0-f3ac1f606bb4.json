                    "Answer": "A data collection method used to study the geological and environmental history of sedimentary basins in the Tibetan Plateau involves systematic sampling of sedimentary profiles at intervals (e.g., every 20 centimeters) to collect powdered samples for rock magnetic and geochemical analysis. Additionally, oriented block samples are collected for paleomagnetic measurements. These samples are analyzed using instruments such as the Olympus Delta Energy‐Dispersive XRF (ED‐XRF) analyzer to measure concentrations of elements like Rb and Sr, providing insights into the region's magnetic stratigraphy and paleoenvironmental records.",
