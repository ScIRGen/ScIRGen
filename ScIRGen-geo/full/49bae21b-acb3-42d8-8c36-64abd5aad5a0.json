The kriging like interpolation method is used to reconstruct the high‐spatial resolution surface mass balance (SMB) over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) from 1800 to 2010, based on ice core records, the outputs of the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts “Interim” reanalysis (ERA‐Interim) as well as the latest polar version of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2.3p2). \n3. Its accuracy is higher than reanalysis data.\n4. Temporal resolution: 1800-2010; Temporal resolution: 1 year; Spatial coverage : the whole West Antarctic Ice Sheet, Spatial resolution: 25km х 25km",
