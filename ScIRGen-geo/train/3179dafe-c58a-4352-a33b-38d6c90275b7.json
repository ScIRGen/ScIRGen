It provides a basis for local government departments to make decisions and early warning before the flood. Thus, we can gain valuable time to take measures to prevent and reduce disasters and reduce the lives of the people. Loss of property. The data set takes one belt, one road, 34 key nodes, and the ratio of cultivated land to land, the proportion of urban land, the proportion of interlaced zone, the density of road network and the impervious surface. Based on the spatial analysis method in ArcGIS, the weights of each index are assigned. The vulnerability of 34 key nodes under extreme precipitation conditions is evaluated, and the vulnerability is determined by natural breakpoint method. Sex is divided into five levels, which represent no vulnerability, low vulnerability, medium vulnerability, high vulnerability and extremely high vulnerability.",

                    "Answer": "A vulnerability assessment dataset refers to a collection of data that evaluates the risk of flood disasters in key regions under extreme precipitation events. It is based on factors such as the proportion of cropland use, urban land use, ecotone areas, road network density, and impervious surface coverage. These factors, combined with spatial analysis methods like those in ArcGIS, are assigned weights to construct an assessment of vulnerability at critical nodes, categorizing them into five levels from no vulnerability to extremely high vulnerability.",

                    "Answer": "Assessing the vulnerability of key nodes along the 'Belt and Road' regions to extreme precipitation events is important to evaluate the flood disaster risk in these areas. This assessment provides a basis for decision-making by local government departments, enabling them to issue early warnings before flood disasters occur. Consequently, this allows for the implementation of disaster prevention and mitigation measures in a timely manner, ultimately reducing the loss of life and property caused by flood disasters.",

                    "Answer": "Researchers can use ArcGIS spatial analysis methods by integrating various indicators such as the percentage of cultivated land, urban land use, interlaced zone proportion, road network density, and impervious surface percentage. These indicators are assigned respective weights to construct a vulnerability assessment of key nodes under extreme precipitation conditions. Natural break classification is then applied to categorize vulnerability into five levels: no vulnerability, low vulnerability, medium vulnerability, high vulnerability, and very high vulnerability.",
