Measurements include leaf area index for crops like corn and cotton, as well as small pine trees, alfalfa, and ephedra. Additionally, measurements of photosynthetic characteristics such as photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, transpiration rate, and leaf temperature are conducted alongside environmental factors like atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, air moisture content, atmospheric pressure, total solar radiation, and photosynthetically active radiation.",
