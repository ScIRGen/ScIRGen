The samples are mainly collected from Phanerozoic granites in Tianfozhi mountain, southwest Yanji, Jilin Province, most of which are Jurassic granites, and a small number of Permian, Triassic and early Cretaceous granites. Apatite fission track ages are obtained by external detectors;（ U-Th - [SM]) / he apatite age and (U – th) / he zircon age were obtained by degassing apatite and zircon with 820 nm optical coupled  fiber-optically coupled diode laser and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) ; The cooling history and exhumation history from Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic in Yanji area can be limited by the obtained data.",

                "Northeastern (NE) China is geologically located in the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), intersected in the Siberian Craton, North China Block (NCB) and Western Pacific Plate. NE China was formed by the continental margin accretion and continent–continent collisions. Since the Paleozoic, it has undergone the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, the Mongol-Okhotsk Sea and the circum-Pacific tectonic domain. The subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean from the early Paleozoic to the early Mesozoic forms the CAOB, then the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean closed diachronously in a scissor-like fashion from west to east during the Middle Jurassic and the Early Cretaceous, signifying the completion of the accretion of the East Asian Continent, and finally, the NE China and the adjacent region has become part of the circum-Pacific tectonomagmatic belt since the Late Mesozoic. The Yanji area, located at the border of China, Russia, and Korea and about 100 km west of the Japan Sea, was considered as a part of the orogenic collage between NCB in the south and the Jiamusi-Khanka Massifs in the northeast. Consequently, the Yanji area is the most likely location where subduction-related magmatic activities and subsequent exhumation processes would occur. The Phanerozoic granitoids have been extensively exposed in the Yanji area, suggesting that the rocks overlying these granitoids have largely been removed. The total exhumation since the Late Cretaceous was on the kilometer scale."

(2010). These data can help us to obtain a clearer insight into the late-stage cooling and inferred exhumation history of granitoids in the Yanji area, NE China, and to place this within the context of the regional tectonic history of the western margin of the Pacific plate. To better interpret the significance of our data, we modeled the data by HeFTy software to quantify the timing and amount of cooling at specific sites with eight apatite FT data, in combination with AHe data sets as far as possible."

The prepared samples were carefully ground and polished to an optical finish to expose internal grain surfaces. Then, apatite spontaneous fission tracks were revealed by 5.5 M HNO3 at 21 °C for 20 s, and zircon by a molten 8 g NaOH ? 11.5 g KOH eutectic at 220 °C for 20–60 h, as necessary to obtain a high-quality etch. AHe and ZHe thermochronology was performed at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Euhedral zircon and apatite crystals without fracture or U/Th-rich inclusion were handpicked for analysis. Grains with a diameter greater than 70 lm were preferred where possible in order to ensure helium gas values were optimal for measurement and to minimize the alpha ejection correction."

                "AnswerCn": "潜在的数据集可以包括来自延吉地区的额外地球化学数据、地震剖面和古磁记录。这些数据集可以提供对构造过程的补充见解，并帮助验证从热年代学数据推断的冷却和剥露历史。",
