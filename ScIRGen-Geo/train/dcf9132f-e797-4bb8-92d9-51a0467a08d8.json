      "description": "This data set contains a total of 717 files, among which the station.txt file mainly describes the site information of 716 stations. Each column corresponds to: longitude, latitude and elevation. The other 716 files named by the station number correspond to the data of 716 stations. The columns in the file are: year, month, day and daily average solar radiation.\nThe data are based on the estimation of conventional meteorological observation elements by the China Meteorological Administration: temperature, humidity, pressure and sunshine hours. The estimation method is obtained by two models: an artificial neural network model and the Yang hybrid model. The Yang hybrid model takes into account the five decay processes of aerosol scattering and absorption, Rayleigh scattering, water vapor absorption, ozone absorption and uniformly mixed gas absorption in clear weather. The influence of clouds on radiation is parameterized by the sunshine hours in cloudy days. The artificial neural network model, however, uses the ANN model to establish the relationship between radiation and ground conventional meteorological variables at each radiating station. Because the accuracy of the model of the artificial neural network is higher than that of the Yang hybrid model, the estimated value of the model of the artificial neural network is used to dynamically correct the estimated value of the Yang hybrid model on a monthly scale, and the data set is finally obtained.",

        "Although solar radiation is a crucial parameter in designing solar power devices and studying land surface processes, long-term and densely distributed observations of surface solar radiation are usually not available. Information on the spatio-temporal distribution of surface solar radiation is indispensable for modeling land surface processes, studying climate changes, and designing photovoltaic power and solar heating systems. Measurements by pyranometers on the ground are the most reliable method to obtain surface solar radiation, but this is not widely applied compared to the measurements of other meteorological variables (such as wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and sunshine duration), owing to its high cost. In addition, radiation measurements often contain erroneous and spurious values due to technical failures and/or operation-related problems. As a result, lack of adequate and high-quality solar radiation data has become a universal problem, particularly in remote and highland regions. So far, many approaches have been developed to estimate surface solar radiation, such as estimation from meteorological variables, model simulation, and satellite retrievals. In general, a well-calibrated sunshine-based model can perform better than cloud-based or temperature-based models. However, it is difficult to extend the application of a calibrated model from one site to another, because model parameters are usually site-dependent, if a model (such as Ångström-Prescott model or ANN-based model) does not physically consider radiative extinction processes in the atmosphere. This problem increases the difficulties in estimating solar radiation in China, which is characterized by complex terrain and climatic conditions."

The ANN-based model is trained with recent reliable radiation data and thus its estimate is more reliable than the physical model. Therefore, the ANN-based model is used to correct the physical model dynamically at a monthly scale."

The new radiation dataset shows superior performance over previous estimates by locally calibrated Ångström-Prescott models. Based on the new radiation dataset, the annual mean daily solar radiation over China is 14.3 MJ m-2.
