            "description": "In situ cassiterite U–Pb dating and trace elemental analysis were performed at the CAS Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, GIG-CAS, using an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS equipped with a Resonetics RESOlution S-155 laser ablation system. NIST SRM610 and an in-lab cassiterite AY-4 were used for external elemental and isotopic calibration, respectively. The Gejiu Sn‒Cu district consists of Malage, Songshujiao, Gaosong, Laochang and Kafang deposits. Two major styles of tin mineralization developed in the district, including cassiterite-sulfide ore within the proximal skarn and stratiform-like cassiterite-iron oxide±sulfide ore in the distal Triassic carbonate country rock. In-situ cassiterite U–Pb dating of two ore types from the Gaosong deposit yields ages of 85.1 – 83.5 Ma, which agree well with the zircon U–Pb age of the Gaofengshan biotite granite. The Dachang Sn‒Zn district is composed of Tongkeng-Changpo, Gaofeng, Dafulou, Huile and Kangma deposits. Economic tin orebodies are hosted by Devonian strata, as massive/stratiform and vein/stockwork mineralization. In-situ cassiterite U–Pb dating of five tin deposits yields U–Pb ages of 95.4 – 90.3 Ma, which agree well with the zircon U–Pb ages of the Longxianggai biotite granites. The Cretaceous U–Pb ages, combined with high Fe–W–Mn but low Nb–Ta concentrations of cassiterite, suggest that Sn-polymetallic deposits in the Gejiu and Dachang districts were formed in magmatic-hydrothermal systems associated with the Late Cretaceous granites.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goal of utilizing LA-ICP-MS for determining U-Pb ages and trace elements in cassiterite is to accurately date the formation of mineral deposits and understand their geochemical characteristics. In the context of the Gejiu and Dachang polymetallic mining areas, this method helps to reveal that the cassiterite, with its distinct trace element signature, is consistent with formation in a magmatic hydrothermal system during the Late Cretaceous. This understanding aids in confirming the magmatic-hydrothermal origin of the mineral deposits in these regions.",
