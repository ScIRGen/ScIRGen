            "description": "In eastern Asia, several Middle-Late Pleistocene human fossils, such as the Dali, Jinniushan, Hualongdong, and Harbin crania, evidently resemble each other and are phylogenetically closer to H. sapiens than to H. neanderthalensis or other archaic humans. The Harbin cranium is the best preserved of this group. It shows a mosaic combination of plesiomorphic and apomorphic features. Here, we suggest that the Harbin skull should be recognized as a new species of Homo.",

                    "Answer": "High-resolution images are crucial in fossil data collection and analysis as they provide clear and detailed visual representations of the fossils, allowing researchers to examine both primitive and advanced features accurately. In the context of the Harbin skull, such images enable the study of its unique characteristics, like large square eye sockets and thick brow ridges, as well as its cranial capacity, which can inform discussions regarding its classification as a new species, Homo longi.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods include both imaging techniques, which provide high clarity and detail in the fossil images, and traditional drawing methods. The imaging techniques offer high-resolution images that are crucial for detailed analysis and scientific dissemination, whereas traditional drawing methods may not capture such fine details but can offer interpretative insights.",

This approach allows researchers to examine the morphological features that suggest a closer phylogenetic relationship with Homo sapiens, aiding in the understanding of human evolution in East Asia.",
