                "Snow cover is an important indicator to estimate climatic changes and a key input for climate, atmospheric, hydrological, and ecosystem models. On one hand, snow cover exacerbates the effect of global warming through the positive feedback between snow and albedo. Furthermore, it affects the hydrometeorological balance through snowmelt. On the other hand, snow cover is severely affected by climate change due to its high sensitivity to changes in temperature and precipitation. The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, which is often called the freshwater tower of Asia, comprises the highest concentration of snow outside the polar regions. The snow cover of this area plays a crucial role in the water supply of several major Asian rivers. Variations in snow cover affect the precipitation, near-ground air temperature, and summer monsoon in Eurasia and across the Northern Hemisphere. Optical satellite data provide important data sources for snow-cover retrieval through the contrasting spectral behavior of snow relative to other natural surfaces in the visible and middle-infrared regions. Many satellites have been used to generate snow-cover products at various spatial and temporal resolutions, such as AMSR-E, MODIS, AVHRR, VIIRS, and Landsat. In particular, new generation satellite sensors (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS) generally show an advantage over old sensors such as AVHRR and TM/ETM which suffer from significant saturation over snow in the visible channels."

Considering that the HKH region features distinct characteristics of snow cover with shallowness, patchiness, and frequent short duration ephemeral snow, in situ site measurements alone are not enough to characterize its accuracy."
