            "description": "The dataset of LAS (Large Aperture Scintillometer, made in Holland) observations was obtained in the Linze grassland station, Linze county (Gansu province), from May 19 to Aug. 31, 2008. The instrument was composed of the transmitter (100°04′10.4″E, 39°15′02.8″N, 9.25m), the receiver (100°03′36.8″E, 39°15′02.8″N, 9.1m) and the data acquisition system. The transmitter and the receiver were 1550m away from each other and the operating altitude was 9.2m. The observation item was natural logarithm of structural parameters of  the  refractive index (UCn2). The transmitting frequency was 0.5HZ. The data were named after WATER_LAS_Linze_yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd.csv (yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd for observation time). The missing data were marked \"None\". For more detailed information, please refer to Directions on LAS (Large Aperture Scintillometer) observations.",

LAS data collection is sensitive to local atmospheric conditions, while MODIS data can be affected by cloud contamination, which impacts the Ts–VI triangle method's reliability. Both approaches require careful handling of missing or contaminated data, but MODIS also requires additional steps for screening elevation discrepancies and cloud-affected pixels.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in determining dry and wet edges for evapotranspiration estimation in arid and semi-arid regions include the scarcity of uncontaminated points by cloud cover in the temperature-vegetation index (Ts–VI) space, especially on partly cloudy days, making estimates unreliable. Furthermore, shortly after rainfall events, the observed dry edge may not represent pixels with minimal evapotranspiration due to non-zero surface soil water content. These challenges necessitate the development of algorithms to automatically determine the edges in the Ts–VI triangular space.",

                    "Answer": "Potential datasets for estimating evapotranspiration using the Ts–Fr triangle method include MODIS data products such as land surface temperature/emissivity (MOD11A1 and MOD11_L2), NDVI (MOD13A2), Calibrated Radiances (MOD021KM), Geolocation (MOD03), and Precipitable Water (MOD05_L2). These datasets, particularly 24 clear-sky MODIS data from May 23rd to August 21st, can be used to estimate the evaporative fraction (EF), evapotranspiration (ET), and sensible heat flux (H) across the study area by applying the Ts–Fr triangle method algorithm.",
