Meteorology plays an important role in the lithosphere, biosphere, soil circle and the atmosphere, providing a basis for assessing the regional contribution and response of climate factors to the world.\nThis data set takes 34 key node regions of the pan third pole as the study area (Abbas, Astana, Bangkok, etc.),based on the site climate data from 2000 to 2016, the meteorological factors in different regions were counted, and the data series of meteorological observations in key nodes were obtained.\nThe main parameters are: annual average maximum value, average minimum value and average temperature; monthly total precipitation and snowfall.",

                    "Answer": "The dataset provides insights into regional climate variability by offering statistics on key meteorological parameters, such as daily, monthly, and annual average temperature values (including maximum and minimum), as well as total monthly precipitation and snowfall amounts. Analyzing these variations across the 34 key node regions (e.g., Abbas, Astana, Bangkok) could reveal patterns of regional climate changes, help understand the local impact of global climate phenomena, and contribute to evaluating the regional contribution and response to climate factors globally.",

                    "Answer": "Expanding a dataset to include more diverse meteorological factors across different regional nodes can improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of climate analysis by providing a more detailed and representative picture of climate conditions. This can enhance the understanding of regional climate dynamics and the contribution of various climatic factors to global climate patterns. Additionally, it can help identify localized trends and anomalies, improving climate prediction and adaptation strategies.",
