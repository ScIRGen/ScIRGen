            "description": "Siberia carbon stocks datasets include three products: live aboveground carbon stocks (AGC), coarse woody debris carbon stocks (CWDC), and the total aboveground carbon stocks (the sum of AGC and CWDC). Annual live AGC were retrieved using SMOS-IC L-VOD (version 2) at a spatial resolution of 25 km. CWDC, including dead-standing and fallen trees, were retrieved from live AGC using a series of ratios between live AGC and CWDC, combined with the decomposition model of CWDC. ",

These techniques address previous challenges such as data gaps and low saturation points in dense forests, offering strong temporal and spatial continuity and higher saturation points for carbon storage estimates. This advancement enables dynamic monitoring of carbon storage changes in Siberian northern forests, which is crucial for understanding the impact of climate change and the potential shift of northern forests from carbon sinks to carbon sources.",

This research aims to determine whether northern forests have shifted from being carbon sinks to carbon sources due to these climatic changes. The dataset overcomes limitations of previous remote sensing methods, such as data gaps and low saturation points in high-latitude regions, by providing strong spatial and temporal continuity and higher saturation points for dense forest carbon storage. This facilitates dynamic monitoring of Siberian northern forest carbon storage and aids in understanding the response strategies of northern forest carbon sinks to climate change.",
