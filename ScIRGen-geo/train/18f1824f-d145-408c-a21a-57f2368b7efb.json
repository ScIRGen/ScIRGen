            "description": "ET (ET) monitoring is crucial to agricultural water resource management, regional water resource utilization planning and socio-economic sustainable development.The limitations of traditional ET monitoring methods mainly lie in that they cannot observe a large area at the same time and can only be limited to observation points. Therefore, the cost of personnel and equipment is relatively high, and they can neither provide surface ET data, nor provide ET data of different land use types and crop types.\nQuantitative monitoring of ET can be achieved by using remote sensing. The characteristics of remote sensing information are that it can not only reflect the macroscopic structure characteristics of the earth surface, but also reflect the microscopic local differences.\nVersion 2.0 (second edition) of the surface evapotranspiration data set of the heihe river basin from 2000 to 2013 is based on multi-source remote sensing data and the latest ETWatch model is adopted to estimate the raster image data. Its temporal resolution is monthly scale and the spatial resolution is 1km scale. The data covers the whole basin in millimeters.Data types include monthly, quarterly, and annual data.\nThe projection information of the data is as follows:\nAlbers equal-area cone projection,\nCentral longitude: 110 degrees,\nFirst secant: 25 degrees,\nSecond secant: 47 degrees,\nCoordinates by west: 4000000 meter.\n\nFile naming rules are as follows:\nMonthly cumulative ET value file name: heihe-1km_2013m01_eta.tif\nHeihe represents the heihe river basin, 1km represents the resolution of 1km, 2013 represents the year of 2013, m01 represents the month of January, eta represents the actual evapotranspiration data, and tif represents the data in tif format.\nName of quarterly cumulative ET value file: heihe-1km_2013s01_eta.tif\nHeihe refers to heihe river basin, 1km refers to the resolution of 1km, 2013 refers to 2013, s01 refers to january-march, is the first quarter, eta refers to the actual evapotranspiration data, and tif refers to the data in tif format.\nAnnual cumulative value file name: heihe-1km_2013y_eta.tif\nAmong them, heihe represents heihe river basin, 1km represents the resolution of 1km, 2013 represents the year of 2013, y represents the year, eta represents the actual evapotranspiration data, and tif represents the data in tif format.",

This approach can provide comprehensive ET data across different land use and crop types, leading to more accurate and detailed information. Consequently, it could improve agricultural water resource management by enabling more precise planning and allocation of water resources. Additionally, it can aid in regional water resource utilization planning by offering a broader and more detailed dataset to inform decision-making, potentially contributing to more effective strategies for socio-economic sustainable development.",
