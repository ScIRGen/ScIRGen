Coupling or use of the General Circulation Model (GCM) output to drive the land surface model is an important source of forcing data for large-scale land surface models, however the spatial and temporal resolution can not meet the requirements of a regional scale land surface model and its coarse resolution ignored regional environmental impact assessment. Thus, a regional scale land surface model or land surface data assimilation system needs forcing data with a higher temporal-spatial resolution. Therefore, downscaling GCM output is necessary in order to prepare for a long series of high spatial and temporal resolution forcing data for regional scale or basin-scale land surface, hydrological and ecological simulation and assimilation. Downscaling is a method of obtaining high-resolution climate or climate change information from relatively coarse-resolution GCMs. Dynamic downscaling uses large scale climatic background information to establish higher resolution meteorological distribution fields by GCMs. Regional climate model is considered to be an effective dynamic downscaling method to derive high-resolution local climate information. The model’s physical meaning is clear, it is built on the nonlinear interaction between large scale and regional scale, and can distinguish local features characterized by local topography, vegetation cover and soil hydrological processes, and can be used anywhere independent of observation data with an improved description of local features."

                "Soil moisture is a variable that plays a leading role in surface water and energy balance. The traditional point measurements can just provide a soil moisture distribution in a limited area. The hydrologic models can simulate the soil moisture variation in large spatial and temporal scales. However, the uncertainty in initial model state, model physical parameters, meteorological forcing variables and model equations brings much error in the soil moisture estimation. Many researchers suggested that the most promising approach for estimating soil moisture is the integration of remote sensing surface soil moisture data and a hydrologic model (Kostove and Jackson, 1993). Many researches have been carried out on optimizing a computational model through minimizing the difference between the observation and model simulation results by the re-parameterization (Jarlan et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2009) or re-initialization (Heathman et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2008) of the computational model separately. The re-parameterization approach can improve the model state variables by adjusting uncertain parameters. Since some parameters can hardly be obtained by field measurements, they are often estimated from the experiences or references, which brings much uncertainty to the model parameters. The re-initialization approach does not attribute the simulation errors to the uncertainties of the initial conditions, model parameters or model physical equations. It can adjust the state variables directly and it adopts the updated state variables as the initial field to re-initialize the model. The most effective and popular re-initialization approach is Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)."

When the ASAR data were available, a cost function was set up based on the gap between the backscattering coefficients from ASAR observation and the backscattering coefficients from the simulations. Then the EnKF was used to optimize the state variables. If the cost function was higher than twice the ASAR observation noises, the simulation was treated as unacceptable. Then the cost function was minimized by the GA approach. The sensitive parameters of the DHSVM were re-parameterized. The simulations were divided into acceptable and unacceptable cases.

                    "Answer": "Forcing data for regional scale land surface models require high temporal-spatial resolution, which is not typically met by the coarse resolution of General Circulation Models (GCMs). Dynamic downscaling using regional climate models can improve resolution, but the process involves complexities such as accurately capturing local features influenced by topography, vegetation, and soil hydrological processes.",

                    "Answer": "The assimilation process is fraught with uncertainties in model initial states, parameters, and equations, which lead to errors in soil moisture estimation. Developing an adjoint model for evaluating derivatives of the cost function is complex, posing limitations to practical application and affecting the accuracy of the integration of remote sensing data with hydrologic models.",

                    "Answer": "In arid regions, determining dry and wet edges for the Ts–VI triangle is challenging, particularly on partly cloudy days or shortly after rainfall events, where few uncontaminated data points are available. This limits the reliability of the method, as the observed dry edge may not accurately reflect minimum evapotranspiration rates due to residual soil moisture.",

                    "Answer": "Forcing data for hydrological, land surface, and ecological models require high temporal-spatial resolution. This can be achieved through downscaling methods that derive high-resolution local climate information from coarse-resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs). Dynamic downscaling using regional climate models can provide the necessary resolution by establishing higher resolution meteorological distribution fields.",

                    "Answer": "MODIS data products, such as land surface temperature/emissivity and NDVI, are used to construct a Ts–Fr triangle space, which helps estimate surface energy parameters like evapotranspiration. An algorithm determines the dry and wet edges, enabling the calculation of the evaporative fraction and other related parameters across the region by processing clear-sky data from MODIS.",
