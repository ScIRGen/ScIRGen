In the famous model, the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric model is 5 °× 7.5 ° and there are 11 layers in the vertical direction; the horizontal resolution of the ocean model is 2.5 °× 3.75 ° and there are 20 layers in the vertical direction. The atmosphere and the ocean are coupled once a day without flux adjustment",

                    "Answer": "The 'FAMOUS climate model' refers to a fast ocean-atmosphere coupled model developed jointly by the UK Met Office and UK universities. It features an atmospheric model with a horizontal resolution of 5°×7.5° and 11 vertical layers, as well as an ocean model with a horizontal resolution of 2.5°×3.75° and 20 vertical layers. The atmosphere and ocean are coupled daily without flux adjustment, and it is used for experiments simulating conditions from the Late Eocene and modern periods.",

                    "Answer": "Using a climate model with an atmospheric resolution of 5°×7.5° and an oceanic resolution of 2.5°×3.75° allows for a comprehensive simulation of both the atmosphere and ocean interactions without flux adjustments. However, the resolution could affect the fine-scale accuracy in reconstructing ancient topographies and ocean depths, as it may not capture smaller geological features or localized climate variations that finer resolutions might detect.",
