            "titleEn": "A global dataset on grid and urban/rural subgrid land surface climate (2000~2019)",
            "description": "The Global Dataset on Grid and Urban/Rural Subgrid Land Surface Climate was generated by the land component of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5), forced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5)-Land data. The dataset covers the spatial range of global land at the finest spatial resolution (25 km) configured for the CESM, and spans a 20-year period from 2000 to 2019, including output at daily and monthly time scales. The dataset provides grid-mean and urban/rural subgrid climatic variables. They are: 2 m temperature, specific humidity, vapor pressure, 10 m wind speed, precipitation, longwave radiation, shortwave radiation, sensible and latent heat flux, ground heat flux, anthropogenic heat flux, wet bulb temperature, skin temperature, apparent temperature, heat index, irrigation, etc. The dataset has been verified against atmospheric reanalyses and station observational data, and proved to have a high degree of accuracy. Specifically, grid-mean results (for air temperature, vapor pressure, radiation, precipitation, etc.) are highly consistent with multiple sets of reanalyses, and urban/rural subgrid results (for sensible heat, latent heat, wet bulb temperature, etc.) are highly consistent with station observations. The dataset accurately and effectively reflects the basic climate change over global land surface in the past two decades. It has been successfully applied to the study of the characteristics, causes, and impacts of global urban heat island based on the wet bulb temperature index. It can also be used to study the impacts of urbanization on other climatic variables, such as extreme precipitation change under urban expansion, and urban thermal environment and thermal comfort of urban residents. This dataset will contribute to improving understandings of the climatic effects of urbanization, and provide technical support for future urban construction and planning, allocation of public resources, protection and management of water and heat resources, etc.",
            "instructions": "File naming: Data files are stored in NetCDF-4 format (file extension “.nc”). File naming conventions are as follows:\nFor monthly data, files are named as:\nI2000Clm50BgcCrop.f02_g16.URBAN_SummerFlood_WFDE5.clm2.h0.YYYY-MM.nc\nFor daily data, files are named as:\nI2000Clm50BgcCrop.f02_g16.URBAN_SummerFlood_WFDE5.clm2.h1.YYYY-MM-DD.nc\nYYYY (2000~2019) indicates the year, MM (01~12) indicates the month, DD (01~31) Indicates the number of days in a month. For example, file\n“I2000Clm50BgcCrop.f02_g16.URBAN_SummerFlood_WFDE5.clm2.h0.2019-08.nc”\ncontains surface climatic variables of August 2019.\nData reading: Data information in NC format files can be read by multiple functions, such as the “ncread” function in MATLAB and “nc.Dataset” in Python. They can also be accessed and used for visualization by the NASA-developed Panoply software.",
