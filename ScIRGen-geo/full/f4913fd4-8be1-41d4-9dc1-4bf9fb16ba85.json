            "description": "The data set includes the characteristics of ancient glacial sediments, such as grain size characteristics, sporopollen characteristics, environmental indicators of chemical elements, mineral characteristics of sediments, etc. Table 1 shows the analysis of five samples collected from the red moraine of Q2, which shows that the grain size characteristics of different ages are the difference of grain size distribution caused by weathering strength. The earlier the moraine is formed, the farther the grain size characteristics of the moraine are from the typical moraine facies. According to Tang Lingyu's (1984) analysis of spores and pollen in lignite (Table 2), there are many clouds and firs, but there are many warm loving Castanea, Liquidambar and Quercus, which indicates that the mountain is dark coniferous cold temperate to warm temperate vegetation, while the piedmont plain is warm temperate or even mountain subtropical vegetation, and its altitude is not very high. The sporopollen analysis data of four surface soil samples and Q31 and q32 moraine samples from high to low altitude on the east slope of Gongga mountain show that the SPOROPOLLEN ASSEMBLAGES OF Q31 and q32 moraines are not significantly different from those at present (tables 3 and 4). The chemical elements of moraine samples were analyzed by icpq plasma analyzer. The results show that the other 18 elements can reflect the weathering degree in different degrees except Fe2O3, which is too influenced by local lithology to retrieve the information of age and weathering degree. There are 28 fine-grained samples, and the results are summarized in the table below. The analysis results of Hengduanshan moraine samples are shown in Table 6. It can be seen that there is little difference in the most stable mineral content of the Moraine in different periods. The mineral characteristics of the Moraine in this area clearly reflect the relationship between it and weathering time. It is hoped that through the geochemical study of the temporal and spatial sequence of glacial deposits, the indicator of element migration can be established for the study of Quaternary glacial environment in China.",
            "instructions": "In this data set, through the collation and integration of the data in this paper, a total of six data tables and a map of ancient glaciers and snow lines in the Hengduan Mountains during the last glacial period are included.

                    "Answer": "Pollen analysis in the context of understanding glacier environments involves examining the characteristics of spores and pollen within sediment samples. This analysis can reveal information about past vegetation and climate conditions, such as indicating that the area was once a cold temperate to warm temperate zone with dark coniferous forest vegetation. Such insights help infer the environmental conditions during the time of sediment deposition.",

                    "Answer": "The methodologies for analyzing mineral characteristics in Quaternary glacial sediments involve identifying and comparing the most stable mineral content across different glacial periods to reflect weathering time relationships. In contrast, chemical element environmental marker analysis uses techniques like ICPQ plasma analysis to identify 19 different elements that can indicate weathering degrees, except for Fe2O3, which is influenced by local lithology. Both methods aim to provide insights into the environmental conditions of glacial periods but focus on different aspects of the sediments.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of analytical methods for studying glacial sediment characteristics is influenced by the need to identify various features such as grain size, spore-pollen characteristics, chemical element indicators, and mineral attributes. Techniques like grain size distribution analysis help differentiate the weathering strength and temporal characteristics of the sediment. Spore-pollen analysis reveals the vegetation and climate conditions during deposition, while chemical element analysis using tools like ICPQ plasma analyzers highlights the weathering degree. These methods collectively aim to establish geochemical indicators for the spatiotemporal evolution of glacial periods.",
