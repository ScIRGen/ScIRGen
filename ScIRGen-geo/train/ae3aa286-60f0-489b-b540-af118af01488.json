            "description": "Based on the data of downscaling results in the precipitation historical period of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5), the combined Method of geographical weighted regression and HASM (High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method) was used to analyze the annual mean precipitation in the future three periods of 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 in the scenario of rcp2.6, rcp4.5 and rcp8.5. Through downscaling simulation and prediction, the 1km downscaling results of the multi-year average precipitation in the three periods of 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 are obtained.",

Understanding and quantifying the spatial variability of precipitation are of key importance in hydrological studies as precipitation drives most hydrological, environmental and agricultural processes. However, strong precipitation gradients over short distances are difficult to capture with point measurements from meteorological stations. In recent years, the development of remote sensing and geographic information technology has presented us with new methods of precipitation observation. In the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), different global climate models (GCMs) participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). These simulations of GCMs have demonstrated the ability to generally replicate the precipitation trend over the second half of the twentieth century, and can offer precipitation in a longer time scale."

For Pre sim1, we use CMIP5 output to form the regression function and then get Pre downscale1, and employ station data to modify the residual to obtain Preres1. While for Pre sim2, we use meteorological information to establish a statistical transfer function using latitude, longitude, elevation, and impact coefficient of aspect as independent variables to produce Pre downscale2, and employ the results of CMIP5 to modify the residual and obtain Preres2. Then, we use the separate dataset in Jiangxi province and 10% of the data from national scale to validate the results. Then, we carry Boxâ€“Cox transform of Prei, which can give a more normal distribution and/or improved predictions (Box and Cox 1964; Sakia 1992).

Third, the relationship between TRMM and its influence factors was determined under the five scales by using the GWR method; the one with the best fit was found to downscale the TRMM data sets. Fifth, the modified residual fields combined with the residuals obtained by subtracting the regression values from station observations were merged using HASM.
