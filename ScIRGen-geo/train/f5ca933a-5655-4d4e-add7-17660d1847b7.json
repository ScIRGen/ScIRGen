Observations were carried out immediately after each rainfall. The following instruments have been used for the observation: the rain gauges (diameter: 20cm; 2 for controlled rainfall and 20 for throughfall), self-made rain slots (20×20×100cm, 10 for throughfall), 5 self-made stem-flow system, self-made moss and litter interception barrel (diameter: 20cm), and rain gauges of the measuring range 10.5mm.",

                    "Answer": "Canopy interception in forest hydrology refers to the process by which precipitation is captured and retained by the canopy of trees and other vegetation, preventing it from reaching the ground immediately. It is typically measured by comparing the amount of rainfall in an open area (using standard rain gauges) with the amount of throughfall (rain that falls through the canopy to the forest floor) and stemflow (water that flows down the trunk of trees). In the context of the mentioned field, canopy interception is studied by using standard rain gauges to measure atmospheric rainfall and custom devices to measure throughfall and stemflow in a forested area dominated by Qinghai spruce.",

                    "Answer": "The observation of throughfall using rain gauges based on canopy closure involves placing 20 rain gauges according to the canopy density, which allows for a more targeted measurement of rainfall passing through specific canopy areas. In contrast, custom-made rain troughs installed in a grid pattern (10 troughs) provide a systematic and evenly distributed measurement of throughfall across the plot. The rain gauges may offer a more precise understanding of canopy influence on rainfall interception, while the grid-pattern troughs might simplify the collection process by covering a uniform area. The choice between these methods may depend on the specific research focus and the terrain of the study area.",

This involves understanding how different components of the forest ecosystem, such as the tree canopy and forest floor, interact with rainfall and contribute to the overall hydrological cycle.",

Twenty rain gauges are placed based on the canopy closure above. Custom rain troughs (size: 20×20×100 cm) are arranged in a grid to observe throughfall. Tree stemflow is recorded using a homemade stemflow device with a serpentine tube, and moss and litter interception is measured using custom interception buckets (diameter: 20 cm). Observations are made after each rainfall from June 1 to October 10, 2008, at the Guantan Forest Hydrological Test Plot in the Dayekou Basin.",
