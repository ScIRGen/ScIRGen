            "description": "Kilometer-level spatially complete (seamless) land surface temperature products have a wide range of applications needs in climate change and other fields. Satellite retrieved LST has high reliability. Integrating the LST retrieved from thermal infrared and microwave remote sensing observation is an effective way to obtain the SLT with certain accuracy and spatial integrity. Based on this guiding ideology, the author developed a framework for retrieving 1km and seamless LST over China landmass, and generated the LST data set accordingly (2002-2020)\n\nFirstly, a look-up table based empirical retrieval algorithm is developed for retrieving microwave LST from AMSR-E/AMSR2 observations. Then, AMSR-E/AMSR2 LST is downscaled by using geographic weighted regression to obtain 1km LST. Finally, the multi-scale Kalman filter is used to fuse AMSR-E/AMSR2 LST and MODIS LST to generate a 1km seamless LST data set.\n\nThe ground valuation results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the 1km seamless LST is about 3K. In addition, the spatial distribution of the 1km seamless LST is consistent with MODIS LST and CLDAS LST.",

                "Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the critical environmental indicators for the study of energy balance and material exchange near the Earth's surface. Remote sensing is a unique means for acquiring LST on the regional and global scales. Generally, we can derive LST from thermal‐infrared (TIR) and microwave (MW) observations with specifically designed retrieval algorithms. It is well recognized that the TIR algorithm is much more developed and the retrieved LST has a relatively high spatial resolution and accuracy. However, the TIR signal is sensitive to the atmosphere and cannot penetrate the clouds, which prevents the onboard TIR sensor from capturing the land surface information and results in a serious data gap in the produced LST products. In contrast, MW can penetrate clouds, making the retrieval of all‐weather LST possible. The empirical statistical model retrieves the LST by establishing the regression relationship between the MW BT and the reference LST. The empirical statistical model is recognized as the most applied MW LST retrieval method due to its simplicity and acceptable accuracy. However, the existing literature shows that the impact of the topography has not been explicitly incorporated into the developed algorithms."

The study of empirical statistical models is focused on the following two aspects: the combination of MW channels and the model's applicability. Taking the landmass of China as the study area, we explore the possibility of improving the LST accuracy by explicitly incorporating the effects of topography, and propose an empirical algorithm for LST retrieval from AMSR‐E BT data."

                "However, the accuracy of MW LST is generally lower than that of TIR LST, making the retrieval of highly accurate all‐weather LST a challenging task. The scale difference can be alleviated by downscaling the MW LST. However, the performance of downscaling is affected by the accuracy of the MW LST. China has a varied and complex near‐surface environment, where the topography, LC and climate in different subregions are remarkably distinctive, making the LST retrieval more challenging."

Finally, the algorithm is verified by comparing the retrieved LST with the reference MODIS LST and field observations in China."

The result shows that the accuracy of LST has improved by 2.81 K in the daytime and 2.14 K at nighttime in China, compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST. The verification at the Naqu sites in the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau shows that the accuracy has improved by 1–2 K in the daytime and 0.7–1 K at nighttime.

The major cause of this deficiency is that there is a large gap of accuracy and spatial scale between the filling source (i.e. MW LST) and TIR LST. In the experiment of AMSR-E LST downscaling, we found that the accuracy of downscaled LST derived by the regression model involving both elevation and slope was lower than that involving only one of these two topographic parameters. Another phenomenon is that slope can achieve more accurate downscaling results in the regions with flat terrain, whereas elevation works better in the regions with steep terrain."

The geographically weighted regression model is adopted in each step to construct the relationship between LST and environmental variables, including normalized differential vegetation index, elevation, and slope.
