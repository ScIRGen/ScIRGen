            "description": "This data set is the long-term concentrations of atmospheric POPs in southeast Tibet, including OCP, PCBs and PAHs. The sampling period in this study was from August 2008 to July 2014. The data was gained from the continuous air monitoring program in STORS. In this program, a low-volume air sampler (~100 L/min) was set at STORS to trap particle- and gas-phase chemicals by a glass fiber filter (GFF, diameter of 9 cm) and polyurethane foam plugs (PUFs, 7.5 cm × 6 cm diameter), respectively. Typically, ~700 m3 of air was collected over a two-week period. Total (gas + particle) phase concentrations are reported. POPs were analyzed at Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The air samples were Soxhlet-extracted, purified on an aluminium/silica column (i.d. 8 mm), a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) column subsequently. The samples were detected on a gas chromatograph with an ion-trap mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Finnigan Trace GC/PolarisQ) operating under MS–MS mode. A CP-Sil 8CB capillary column (50 m ×0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used for OCPs and PCBs and a DB-5MS column (60 m ×0.25mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used for PAHs. Field blanks and  procedural blanks were prepared. The recoveries ranged from 64% to 112% for OCPs, and 65% to 92% for PAHs. The reported concentrations were not corrected for recoveries.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using glass fiber filters and polyurethane foam involve distinct roles: glass fiber filters are used for collecting total suspended particulates, while polyurethane foam is employed for absorbing gaseous pollutants. Both techniques are integrated into an active air sampler system, which operates every other day for approximately 24 hours and collects samples over two weeks, capturing an air volume of 700 cubic meters. This approach ensures comprehensive sampling of both particulate and gaseous phases of pollutants.",

                    "Answer": "The underlying purpose of collecting long-term concentration data of atmospheric persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is to monitor and understand the environmental and health impacts of these pollutants over time. The data collection method in this context ensures accuracy and reliability by using an active atmospheric sampler equipped with glass fiber filters and polyurethane foam to capture both gaseous and particulate pollutants. The samples undergo rigorous pre-treatment and analysis processes, including Soxhlet extraction, silica-alumina column purification, and GPC column separation to remove impurities. The use of gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry (GC/ITMS) for analysis further ensures precise separation and detection of various POPs. Additionally, strict quality control measures, including laboratory and field blanks, are implemented, and the recovery rates for laboratory samples are documented, although concentrations are not corrected for recovery rates.",
