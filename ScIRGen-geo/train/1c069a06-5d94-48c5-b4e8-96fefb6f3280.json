            "description": "This data set was obtained in the Fine scale Optical Remote sensing Experiment of mixed Stand over complex Terrain (FOREST) in Genhe reserve area. The experimental site is located near Genhe Ecological Station (national ecosystem research network of Greater Khingan forest ecosystem in Inner Mongolia). The data acquisition time is 9:00-17:00 (Beijing time) on August 7, 2016, and the sampling interval is 0.5 hours. The measuring equipment is FLIR T440 camera. The brightness temperatures of six components: illumination leaf, shadow leaf, illumination trunk, shadow trunk, illumination background and shadow background were extracted through image supervision  classification. After the removal of reflection term contribution and emissivity correction, the radiometric temperatures of six components were finally obtained. This data set is expected to be applied to thermal infrared modeling, component temperature inversion, evapotranspiration estimation and so on.",
