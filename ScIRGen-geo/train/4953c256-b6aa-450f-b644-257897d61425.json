Based on the data of mining, illegal house renovation, new roads, land leveling and ecological restoration in the key areas of Qilian Mountain, the Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2 and ZY3 high-resolution remote sensing images to compare the changes before and after statistical analysis. in the key areas of Qilian Mountain, the changes of land types are investigated and verified block by block; in the areas with suspicious maps, re-interpretation and verification; in the areas with unreflecting images, field verification is carried out to collect relevant data, check and correct the location. At the same time, it further checks the attribute information of mining, illegal house renovation, new roads, land leveling and ecological restoration in the key areas of Qilian Mountain in 2020, and unifies the input and editing of the patches and their attributes, forming the data set of 2m spatial resolution human activities in the key areas of Qilian Mountain in 2020, realizing the current situation and timeliness of ecological management in the key areas of Qilian Mountain, and providing data support for the monitoring of human activities in the key areas of Qilian Mountain in 2020.",

                    "Answer": "Inaccuracies in mapping human activities in regions like the Qilian Mountains with diverse ecological restoration efforts may arise from several factors. These include the challenges of differentiating between similar land cover types using high-resolution remote sensing imagery, the potential for misclassification or errors during the visual interpretation of satellite images, and the difficulty in capturing small-scale or subtle changes in land use. Additionally, areas that are ecologically restored might not be easily distinguishable from surrounding land without ground verification, and human-induced changes might not be fully visible from satellite imagery alone.",

The dataset aims to ensure the contemporaneity and timeliness of ecological governance in the Qilian Mountain region, providing data support for human activity monitoring in 2020. It involves high-resolution remote sensing imagery analysis, field verification, and the integration of attribute information to achieve an overall classification accuracy exceeding 95%.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using high-resolution remote sensing imagery from satellites such as Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and Ziyuan-3 to compare and statistically analyze changes in land plots over time. Each plot that shows a change in land use is individually investigated and verified. For plots where imagery analysis is inconclusive, further interpretation and validation are conducted. Ground verification is done for land types that cannot be deduced from imagery alone. The attributes of activities such as mining, illegal housing corrections, new roads, land leveling, and ecological restoration are updated, and the data is uniformly edited to form a comprehensive dataset with spatial resolution of 2 meters and classification accuracy better than 95%.",

These methods include investigating and verifying changes in land parcels, re-evaluating suspicious areas, and conducting field checks for areas not clearly reflected in imagery. The process ensures high classification accuracy, with overall precision exceeding 95%, by cross-verifying and editing map features and attributes to capture real-time ecological governance.",
