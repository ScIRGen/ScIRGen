            "description": "Soil moisture (SM) plays a vital role in regulating the water and energy exchange between land surfaces and the atmosphere and is declared an essential climate variable by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a crucial parameter describing vegetation attenuation properties in microwave radiative transfer equation, and it has been proven to be a promising ecological indicator for studying plant hydraulics, carbon stocks, and vegetation phenology. A long-term SM and polarization-, frequency-dependent VODs (C/X/Ku) product was derived from the inter-calibrated AMSR-E/2 multi-frequency brightness temperature at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degree, using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA). The MCCA comprehensively considers the physical relationship between multiple microwave channels and could simultaneously retrieve frequency- and polarization-dependent VODs and SM. The new MCCA AMSR-E/2 SM dataset was validated over 25 dense soil moisture networks from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) watersheds. The results showed that MCCA performs best in terms of ubRMSE among the current publicly available SM datasets related to AMSR-E/2. In addition, polarization-, frequency-dependent VODs from MCCA may provide new insights for better understanding the water fluxes in plant physiology.",

                "Surface soil moisture (SM) plays a vital role in regulating water and energy exchanges between land surfaces and the atmosphere and is thus critically important for hydrological modeling, agricultural management, and numerical weather forecasting. Over the past few decades, passive microwave remote sensing has shown great advantages in monitoring SM at global or regional scales due to its high sensitivity to surface dielectric properties and frequent and continuous (all weather) monitoring of the Earth's surface. On the other hand, vegetation optical depth (VOD, τ) is a crucial parameter describing vegetation attenuation properties in the microwave radiative transfer equations (RTE). Although VOD was originally treated as a transition variable for correcting vegetation effects in SM retrieval algorithms, it has been proven to be a promising ecological indicator for studying plant hydraulics, carbon stocks, and vegetation phenology. Long-term and accurate global monitoring of SM and VOD are essential to enhance our knowledge on the linkage between water, and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Spaceborne passive microwave technology has experienced rapid development since the Skylab mission in the 1970s. Current spaceborne microwave radiometers can be divided into two categories: (i) multi-frequency radiometers with selected channels from C-band (6.9 GHz) to W-band (89 GHz), and (ii) single-frequency radiometers at L-band (1.4 GHz). Although the L-band has been proven to be the optimal tool for monitoring SM, data of this band are only available for > 10 years with the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission launched in November 2009 and the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) launched in January 2015. On the other hand, multi-frequency radiometers at higher frequency bands provide a much longer heritage of measurements, although their sensitivity to SM is weaker than that of L-band. Among those multi-frequency radiometers, two typical spaceborne sensors are the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and its successor AMSR2. The AMSR-E was in orbit from 2002 to 2011 and carried on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite Aqua. It is a twelve-channel, six-frequency (from 6.9 to 89 GHz), total power passive-microwave radiometer system. The AMSR2 launched aboard the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission 1st-Water (GCOM-W1) satellite on May 18, 2012, is configured with instrument attributes (frequency band, incidence angle, etc.) similar to AMSR-E. The combined use of AMSR-E/2/3 brightness temperature (TB) observations could generate long-term data of SM and VOD, which are valuable for climate change studies. Concurrent with the development of passive microwave spaceborne missions, the scientific community has also made large efforts for improving the retrieval methodology of SM and VOD at the global scale. Most SM and VOD retrievals designed for AMSR-E/2 are based on the tau-omega model, which is the zero-order solution of RTE by neglecting multiple scattering between vegetation and the surface."

It is expected that the MCCA algorithm can be extended to the observations of the ongoing AMSR2 or other similar satellite missions with multi-frequency capability, such as FY-3B/C/D/F/G or the upcoming AMSR3 and CMIR missions."

The harmonized multi-frequency TB data (2002–2021) was then used to generate long-term SM and VOD product. To effectively validate the retrieved SM, ground-based measurements from 25 dense networks were used. In this study, we extended MCCA to the AMSR-E/2 configurations at the global scale. For the implementation of MCCA, the effective soil temperature was estimated using the Ka-band (37 GHz) observations according to the method of Holmes et al. (2009). To account for the surface roughness effect, we used the Qp model proposed by Shi et al. (2005) in this study."

For the indirect evaluation of VOD with aboveground biomass (AGB) and MODIS NDVI, the MCCA product showed the performance comparable to other products (LPRM-C/X, VODCA-C/X/Ku). MCCA-derived VODs, especially for the H-polarized VODs, exhibited smooth non-linear density distribution with AGB and high temporal correlations with MODIS NDVI over most regions of the globe. In particular, MCCA-derived VODs can physically present reasonable variations across the microwave spectrum (values of VOD increase with microwave frequency), which is superior to the LPRM and VODCA products."
