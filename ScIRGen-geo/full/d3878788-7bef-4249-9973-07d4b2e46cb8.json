            "description": "1) Data content: Daily PM2.5 concentration data at more than 5000 sites in the Northern Hemisphere from 1959 to 2022. 2) Data source and processing method: Using visibility and additional meteorological observations, a machine learning method is used to estimate daily PM2.5 concentration. The first 80% of PM2.5 concentration data of the time series at each site is used for training, and the remaining 20% of the data is used for testing. 3) Data quality description: Training results show the slope between the estimated PM2.5 concentration and the monitored PM2.5 concentration is 0.955±0.0002 within the 95% confidence interval (CI), the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.95, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 7.2 μg/m3, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 3.2 μg/m3. Test results show the slope between the predicted PM2.5 concentration and the monitored PM2.5 concentration is 0.864±0.0010 within a 95% CI, the R2 is 0.79, the RMSE is 14.8 μg/m3, and the MAE is 7.6 μg/m3. 4) Data application achievements and prospects: Supplement historical and long-term PM2.5 concentration data to provide support for research on atmospheric environment, human health, climate change, and model assimilation.",
