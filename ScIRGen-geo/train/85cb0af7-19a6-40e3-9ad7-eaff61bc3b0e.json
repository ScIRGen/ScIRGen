            "description": "Firstly, country-wise sectorial water withdrawal data are collected from FAO AQUASTAT database, Peter Gleick’s water use data, country statistics and literatures. In order to get consistent data, all data are unified to 2015 due to inconsistent times. For the data of year 2013-2017 close to 2015, the values of these years are directly used as water withdrawals of 2015. For the others, GDP, population, temperature, precipitation, irrigation area, carbon dioxide emission, nighttime light index, coal production, urban population corresponding to the water use data of different years in each country are collected, the panel data regression model of fixed effect and random effect between industrial water, agricultural water and domestic water and these factors are established, respectively. Sectorial water withdrawals in 2015 are estimated for every country.",

                    "Answer": "Data harmonization is necessary due to the inconsistency in data collection years across different countries. To achieve a uniform dataset for 2015, data from years close to 2015, such as 2013-2017, are directly used. For other years, estimates are made using panel data regression models that consider factors like GDP, population, temperature, precipitation, irrigation area, CO2 emissions, night light index, coal production, and urban population to account for discrepancies.",

                    "Answer": "Unifying diverse datasets from multiple years into a single-year dataset can lead to increased accuracy and reliability if done carefully, as it allows for consistent comparison and analysis. However, it also poses challenges, such as potential discrepancies due to variations in data collection methods, the need for assumptions or estimations for missing data, and the possibility of introducing bias if the unification process does not adequately account for all variables. Using panel data regression models, as mentioned, can help mitigate some of these issues by allowing for the incorporation of fixed and random effects, thereby improving the robustness of the estimated water usage figures for 2015.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to create a consistent and comparable dataset for the year 2015 by aligning water usage data, which varies in source and year, to understand and estimate water consumption across industrial, agricultural, and domestic sectors in countries along the '一带一路'. This involves using data from FAO AUASTAT, Gleick's research, national statistics, and literature, and employing regression models that account for factors like GDP, population, temperature, and others to estimate the 2015 water usage accurately.",

                    "Answer": "To harmonize water usage data into the year 2015, the initial step involves collecting water usage data by sector for various countries from sources like the FAO AUASTAT database, research data from the Pacific Institute by scholar Gleick, and statistics from each country. If the data is from years close to 2015, specifically between 2013 and 2017, those values are directly used as 2015 estimates. For other years, a panel data regression model incorporating fixed and random effects is constructed using variables such as GDP, population, temperature, precipitation, irrigation area, CO2 emissions, night-time light index, coal production, and urban population to estimate the 2015 water usage by sector for each country.",
