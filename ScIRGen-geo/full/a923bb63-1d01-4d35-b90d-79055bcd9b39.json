            "description": "According to the inducing factors of potential thermal melting disasters (mainly thermal melting landslides) in the pan Arctic, including temperature (freezing and Thawing Environment), rainfall, snow cover, soil type, topography and landform, and underground ice content, based on the basic data provided by the big data resource database of the earth, machine learning methods (logic regression, random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machine, etc.) are adopted, and the currently interpreted thermal melting landslides in the northern hemisphere are taken as training samples, Finally, the zonation map of thermal melt disaster susceptibility (occurrence probability) in the pan Arctic was obtained. According to the sensitivity of driving factors, it is found that climate factors (temperature and rainfall) have the largest contribution to the occurrence and distribution of thermal melt disasters, followed by slope factors, and ice content and radiation also have a high contribution.",
            "instructions": "The thermal melt disaster susceptibility data is stored in TIFF grid data. The folder includes common railway and highway engineering vector (.

Each of these factors requires precise measurement and monitoring, often in remote and harsh environments. Additionally, the reliance on machine learning methods like logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines necessitates high-quality, comprehensive datasets for accurate training and prediction, which can be difficult to obtain in such a complex and dynamic region.",

These models can capture complex relationships and interactions between variables such as temperature, rainfall, soil type, topography, and ice content. The models' ability to process and analyze large datasets enhances the prediction of thermokarst landslide probabilities, making the susceptibility maps more reliable and informative. This integration helps identify key contributing factors, with climate elements like temperature and rainfall having the largest impact, followed by slope, ice content, and radiation.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of environmental factors into a cohesive dataset involves utilizing machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. These methods leverage base data provided by a global earth data repository and use interpreted thermokarst landslide instances in the Northern Hemisphere as training samples. The process aims to create a susceptibility zoning map indicating the probability of thermokarst hazard occurrences in the pan-Arctic region.",
