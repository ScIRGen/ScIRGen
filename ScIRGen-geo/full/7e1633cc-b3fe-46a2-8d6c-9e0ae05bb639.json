            "description": "The continuous snow cover area in time and space is one of key elements to  study of land surface energy and water exhange, mountain hydrology, land surface model, numerical weather forecast and climate change. However, the large number of clouds causes data gaps in the snow cover area from optical remote sensing. The MODIS observations of Terra and aqua, FY-2E and FY-2F VISSR are used to obtain fractional snow cover (subpixel snow cover) which is less affected by the cloud, and the snow cover of the remaining cloud pixels is supplemented according to the time series information. Finally the cloudless daily snow fraction is obtained. This data set includes the daily fractional snow cover at 5 km spatial resolution in the Tibetan Plateau and China.",

Remote sensing instrument, especially optical and infrared sensor onboard Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite, is useful in high-resolution snow mapping upon places where people can hardly arrive. However, vast obscuration of clouds and cloud/snow confusion in the visible and infrared wavelengths cause data gaps and errors in snow cover maps. Even the combination of Terra and Aqua MODIS, however, can hardly reduce cloud coverage to less than 46%. MODIS does not have enormous chances to encounter clear-sky condition because MODIS only observes a same place two times or less in the daytime of a single day. Imagers onboard GEOstationary (GEO) satellites can view Earth frequently, and therefore have more opportunities to obtain cloud-free observations since clouds are moving. Fractional snow cover derived from GEO satellite imagers provides a good data source for the generation of cloud-free fractional snow cover."

Satellite remote sensing provides a unique ability to monitor snow cover and its dynamics at large scales that sparse meteorological observation networks cannot accomplish. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which has flown on board the Terra and Aqua satellites since 1999 and 2002, respectively, has been used to map the daily global SCA at 500 m resolution for years by taking advantage of a wide scanning swath and advanced spectral resolution. The normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which employs the high reflectance of snow in the visible wavelengths and a strong absorptive manner of snow in near-infrared wavelengths, has often been used to detect snow cover and estimate the fractional snow cover (FSC) from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and MODIS imagery. The overall accuracy of the MODIS standard binary snow cover product is close to 93%, while the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the MODIS standard FSC product can reach approximately 0.10. Daily SCA maps derived from optical sensors tend to have serious data gaps, which are primarily due to clouds that obscure the optical detection of Earth’s surfaces. Among the spaceborne sensors with the ability to detect snow cover concerning spatiotemporal continuity, optical imagers onboard geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites are likely the most effective and reliable because they have the unique capacity to frequently observe approximately one-third of Earth’s surface in near real-time."

Daily SCA maps derived from optical sensors tend to have serious data gaps, which are primarily due to clouds that obscure the optical detection of Earth’s surfaces. However, the coarse spatial resolution (~25 km) and the accuracy of SCA derived from passive microwave sensors is considerably inconsistent with those of SCA derived from optical sensors. Moreover, currently employed active and passive microwave imaging sensors exhibit relatively narrow swaths during daily revisits over mid-latitude regions. Such inherent limitations of microwave sensor data typically reduce their ability to alleviate the deficiencies of SCA products in terms of spatiotemporal continuity."

                    "Answer": "Vast obscuration of clouds and cloud/snow confusion in the visible and infrared wavelengths cause data gaps and errors in snow cover maps. Even with the combination of Terra and Aqua MODIS, reducing cloud coverage to less than 46% is challenging because MODIS observes the same place two times or less in the daytime of a single day.",

                    "Answer": "The coarse spatial resolution and accuracy of snow cover area derived from passive microwave sensors are considerably inconsistent with those derived from optical sensors. The inherent limitations of microwave sensor data, such as relatively narrow swaths during daily revisits over mid-latitude regions, typically reduce their ability to alleviate deficiencies in terms of spatiotemporal continuity.",

This approach provides more opportunities for obtaining clear-sky observations, which improves the accuracy and completeness of snow cover maps.",

Cross-validation with higher-resolution satellite data and employing interpolation techniques like the Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) can help mitigate these challenges by filling data gaps caused by clouds.",

The data gaps caused by clouds are filled using the Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) method, which provides monotonous and smooth interpolations.

Although MODIS provides high-resolution snow mapping, it struggles to reduce cloud coverage to less than 46%, limiting its effectiveness.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of snow cover data from optical sensors is affected by cloud cover because clouds obscure the optical detection of Earth's surface, leading to data gaps and errors. Optical sensors rely on visible and infrared wavelengths, which clouds can block, thus preventing accurate measurement of the snow cover. Geostationary satellites with frequent observations can help reduce these gaps by providing more opportunities to observe cloud-free conditions.",

Further studies could focus on improving cross-validation techniques and developing more sophisticated models that can estimate snow cover with higher accuracy despite the presence of clouds.",

The Landsat-8 OLI images offer detailed snow cover information and are useful for validating fractional snow cover accuracy. The SRTM DEM data provide elevation information, which is crucial for understanding the influence of topography on snow cover distribution.
