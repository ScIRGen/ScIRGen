            "description": "This data set is based on the spatial distribution data set of extreme precipitation disaster risk (2019) and vulnerability spatial distribution data set (2019) in Yangon deep water port area, combined with GDP and population distribution data of Yangon deep water port area, and through the definition of \"risk = exposure × vulnerability × risk\", the risk of extreme precipitation disaster in Yangon deepwater port area is calculated. The data set can provide a reference for the local disaster prevention and reduction work. By analyzing the distribution and causes of high risk, we can put forward engineering measures or non engineering measures to achieve the purpose of disaster reduction and prevention, and reduce the loss of people's lives and property caused by extreme precipitation disasters.",
