            "description": "The data was obtained from the 30-second global elevation dataset developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and completed in 1996. Downloaded the data from the NCAR and UCAR Joint Data Download Center (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds758.0/) and redistributed it through this data center. GTOPO30 divides the world into 33 blocks. The sampling interval is 30 arc seconds, which is 0.00833333333333333 degrees. The coordinate reference is WGS84. The DEM is the distance from the sea level in the vertical direction, ie the altitude, in m, the altitude range from -407 to 8752, the ocean depth information is not included here, the negative value is the altitude of the continental shelf; the ocean is marked as -9999, the elevation above the coastline is at least 1; the island less than 1 square kilometer is not considered.\nIn order to facilitate the user's convenience, on the basis of the block data, splice 10 blocks in -10S-90N and 20W-180E without any resampling processing.

                    "Answer": "The GTOPO30 dataset is a global elevation dataset developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) featuring a 30 arc-second sampling interval, equivalent to approximately 0.008333333333333 degrees. It provides elevation values representing the height above sea level, with a range from -407 to 8752 meters, and excludes ocean depth information. The dataset divides the globe into 33 blocks and uses the WGS84 coordinate reference system. It was completed in 1996 and redistributes data through the NCAR and UCAR data download center.",

Islands smaller than 1 square kilometer are excluded to simplify data management and processing, as these smaller features might not significantly impact the overall elevation representation and would require significant additional resources to accurately map and include.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating 30-second global elevation data with other geospatial datasets of varying resolutions may lead to challenges in terms of data consistency, accuracy, and usability. The differences in resolution could result in mismatches or inaccuracies at boundaries, potentially affecting analyses such as terrain modeling or landscape analysis. However, the integration could also enrich the dataset by providing broader context or additional dimensions if handled correctly, for example, by ensuring proper alignment and resampling techniques are used.",

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves downloading elevation data blocks covering the Pan-Third Pole region from the NCAR and UCAR data center. These blocks are then merged based on their geographic coordinates, specifically within the range of -10S-90N and 20W-180E, without any resampling. The merged dataset, formatted as DEM_ptpe_Gtopo30.nc, preserves the original sampling interval of 30 arc seconds and uses WGS84 as the coordinate reference system. The elevation values represent heights above sea level in meters, with negative values indicating elevations below sea level on the continental shelf, and ocean areas marked as -9999.",
