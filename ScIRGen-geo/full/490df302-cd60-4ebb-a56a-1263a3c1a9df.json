            "description": "Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as Asia's water tower plays a critical role in regional water and energy cycles, largely affecting water availability for downstream countries. Rain gauges are indispensable in precipitation measurement, but are quite limited in the TP that features complex terrain and the harsh environment. Satellite and reanalysis precipitation products can provide complementary information for ground-based measurements, particularly over large poorly gauged areas. Here we optimally merged gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data by determining weights of various data sources using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and environmental variables including elevation, surface pressure, and wind speed. A Multi-Source Precipitation (MSP) data set was generated at a daily timescale and a spatial resolution of 0.1° across the TP for the 1998‒2017 period. The correlation coefficient (CC) of daily precipitation between the MSP and gauge observations was highest (0.74) and the root mean squared error was the second lowest compared with four other satellite products, indicating the quality of the MSP and the effectiveness of the data merging approach. We further evaluated the hydrological utility of different precipitation products using a distributed hydrological model for the poorly gauged headwaters of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in the TP. The MSP achieved the best Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (over 0.8) and CC (over 0.9) for daily streamflow simulations during 2004‒2014. In addition, the MSP performed best over the ungauged western TP based on multiple collocation evaluation. The merging method could be applicable to other data-scarce regions globally to provide high quality precipitation data for hydrological research. The latitude and longitude of the left bottom corner across the TP, the number of rows and columns, and grid cells information are all included in each ASCII file.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the Earth’s Third Pole, is the highest plateau in the world with a mean elevation of more than 4000 m. The TP and surrounding mountains are known as the water towers of Asia where headwaters of many major rivers in Asia reside, such as the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yangtze, and Yellow Rivers. Research on the hydrological processes across the TP is of great importance for improving water resource management and mitigating natural hazards including floods and droughts in the TP and downstream countries. Precipitation plays a fundamental role in the water and energy cycles and shapes ecological landscapes and ecosystems, generating 55%–60% of annual runoff for all major rivers on the TP. There are currently four primary ways to estimate precipitation: 1) ground-based gauge observations, 2) ground-based radar remote sensing, 3) satellite remote sensing, and 4) atmospheric reanalysis models. Gauge-based precipitation observations are generally considered most accurate and reliable. But there are almost no meteorological stations in the vast western and northern TP due to complex terrain and the harsh environment. Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in hydrometeorological applications, particularly for data-scarce areas. However, satellite data generally overestimate light rainfall (e.g., 0–10 mm day21) and underestimate moderate and heavy rainfall (e.g., over 10 mm day21) in the TP. Reanalysis data may not perform well in complex terrain, implying the necessity of considering environmental impacts."
