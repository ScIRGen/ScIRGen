            "description": "This data set mainly includes the results of Si isotope analysis of mid ocean ridge basalts obtained from the iodp1256 borehole in the Pacific Ocean. The specific geographical location of the samples is 6 ° 4‘ N，91 ° 56’W。 The types of samples include volcanic rocks, sheet dykes, transition zones and gabbros. Some samples are from ~ 15mA ago. Si isotope data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation. After the sample was digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin, the silicon isotope was measured by MC-ICPMS, and the international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. The obtained Zn isotopic data provide important information for the Si isotopic composition of the global altered oceanic crust reservoir, and the test was completed from January 31, 2017 to June 30, 2018.",
