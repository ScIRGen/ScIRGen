(2) The data set is based on the field measured data of vorticity, and adopts the internationally recognized standard processing method of vorticity related data. The basic process includes: outlier elimination coordinate rotation WPL correction storage item calculation precipitation synchronization data elimination threshold elimination outlier elimination U * correction missing data interpolation flux decomposition and statistics. This data set also contains the model simulation data calibrated based on the vorticity correlation data set. (3) the data set has been under data quality control, and the data missing rate is 37.3%, and the missing data has been supplemented by interpolation. (4) The data set has scientific value for understanding carbon sink function of alpine wetland, and can also be used for correction and verification of mechanism model.",
