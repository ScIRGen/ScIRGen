            "description": "The data set is MODIS vegetation index data (MOD13Q1). The source areas of the three rivers are extracted to carry out the research and analysis of the source areas of the three rivers separately. MOD13Q1 is a 16-day composite vegetation index, including normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The spatial scope of Sanjiang Source covers two MODIS files (h25v05 and h26v05). Data storage format is hdf. Each file contains 12 bands: Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Data Quality (VI Quality), Red Reflectance, Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR Reflectance), Blue Reflectance, Mid Infrared Reflectance, Observation. Viewzenith angle, sun zenith angle, relative azimuth angle, composite day of the year and pixel reliability.\nThe data format of this data set is hdf, spatial resolution is 250m, temporal resolution is 16 days, time range: February 2000 to October 2018.",

                    "Answer": "The MODIS vegetation index data (MOD13Q1) is a dataset that provides vegetation indices, specifically the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), for analyzing vegetation characteristics. It is a 16-day composite dataset that includes multiple bands such as red reflectance, NIR reflectance, and several angles related to observation and solar position. The data is stored in hdf format with a spatial resolution of 250 meters and covers a temporal range from February 2000 to October 2018. This data is extracted for specific regions, like the Sanjiangyuan area, to facilitate focused research and analysis of vegetation trends and patterns.",

                    "Answer": "To extract and prepare MODIS vegetation index data for analysis in the 三江源 region, the process involves obtaining MOD13Q1 files, which cover the spatial extent of the region using MODIS tiles h25v05 and h26v05. Data is stored in hdf format with a spatial resolution of 250 meters and a temporal resolution of 16 days, spanning from February 2000 to October 2018. The dataset includes 12 bands, such as NDVI, EVI, and other reflectance and quality metrics. These need to be extracted and potentially preprocessed for quality assurance before being used in detailed regional analysis.",
