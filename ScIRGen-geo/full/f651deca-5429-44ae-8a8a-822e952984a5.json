            "description": "The data set contains data from the meteorological gradient observation system of sidaqiao super station downstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.The station is located in the four Bridges of dalaihubu town, ejin banner, Inner Mongolia.The latitude and longitude of the observation point are 101.1374e, 42.0012n, and 873m above sea level.Air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed sensors are installed at 5m, 7m, 10m, 15m, 20m and 28m, with a total of 6 layers, facing due north.The wind sensor is installed at 15m, facing due north;The barometer is installed in the waterproof box;Dump-type rain gauge installed at 28m;The four-component radiometer is installed at 10m, facing due south;The two infrared thermometers are installed at 10m, facing due south, and the probe is facing vertically down.The two photosynthetic effective radiometers are installed at a location of 10m, facing due south, with the probes pointing vertically up and down, respectively.Part of the soil sensor is installed at 2m to the south of the tower body, in which the soil heat flow plate (self-calibration formal) (3 pieces) is successively buried at 6cm underground;The average soil temperature sensor TCAV is buried 2cm and 4cm underground.The soil temperature probe is buried at 0cm on the surface and 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm, 160cm and 200cm underground.The soil moisture sensors were embedded in the ground at 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm, 160cm and 200cm.\nThe observation items are: wind speed (WS_5m, WS_7m, WS_10m, WS_15m, WS_20m, WS_28m) (unit: m/s), wind direction (WD_15m) (unit: degree), air temperature and humidity (Ta_5m, Ta_7m, Ta_10m, Ta_15m, Ta_20m, Ta_28m and RH_5m, RH_7m, RH_10m, RH_15m, RH_20m, RH_28m) (unit: Celsius, percentage), air pressure (Press) (unit:Hundred mpa), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), the radiation of four component (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts per square meter), the surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit: c), up and down the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR_U_up, PAR_U_down) (unit: second micromoles/m2), the average soil temperature (TCAV) (unit: c), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit:W/m2), soil moisture (Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm, Ms_10cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_40cm, Ms_80cm, Ms_120cm, Ms_160cm, Ms_200cm) (unit: volume water content, percentage), soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_40cm, Ts_80cm, Ts_120cm, Ts_160cm, Ts_200cm) (unit: Celsius).\nProcessing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) eliminate the moments with duplicate records;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the part marked by red letter in the data is the data in question;(5) the format of date and time is uniform, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2017-9-10-10:30;(6) the naming rule is: AWS+ site name.\nPlease refer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al. (2011) for observation data processing.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."
