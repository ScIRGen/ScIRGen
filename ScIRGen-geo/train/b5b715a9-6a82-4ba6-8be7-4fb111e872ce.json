            "description": "Under the development of global changes and human activities, ecological problems on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau are becoming increasingly prominent. In order to develop effective environmental policies and conservation measures, a rapid and accurate assessment of ecological vulnerability is essential. The dataset is based on Google Earth Engine with source data from MODIS products, SRTM dataset and human footprint dataset. Seven indicators of heat, wetness, greenness, elevation, slope, salinity, and human footprint were selected and integrated to form the ecological vulnerability dataset. The format is TIFF format and the projection is WGS_1984_Albers projection. The spatial resolution of the data is 1000 m, and the time period is from 2000 to 2018, providing one image per year. This dataset can provide basic data for ecological security assessment of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "生态脆弱性 refers to the ecological vulnerability of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, indicating how susceptible the ecosystem is to external changes and stressors. It is assessed by integrating various environmental factors such as heat, moisture, greenness, salinity, elevation, slope, and human footprint data to create a composite measure of vulnerability. This measure is represented by a dimensionless value, with higher numbers indicating greater vulnerability.",

                    "Answer": "By integrating data from MODIS products, SRTM datasets, and human footprint datasets using PCA, a more comprehensive ecological vulnerability dataset can be developed. This integration allows for the assignment of weights to different data sources, which can enhance the accuracy and reliability of ecological vulnerability assessments on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The resulting dataset provides a measure of vulnerability that is indicative of the ecosystem's susceptibility to changes caused by global change and human activities. The consequence is a more informed basis for formulating effective environmental policies and conservation measures.",

This is crucial for formulating effective environmental policies and protection measures. The objectives guide the choice of data sources and methodologies by incorporating factors such as heat, humidity, greenness, and salinity from MODIS products, elevation and slope from the SRTM dataset, and human footprint data. These are integrated using PCA to assign weights and form an ecological vulnerability dataset, which provides foundational data for assessing the ecological security of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.",
