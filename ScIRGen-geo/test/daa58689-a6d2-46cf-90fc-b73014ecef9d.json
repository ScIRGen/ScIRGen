            "description": "Ta (Near-surface air temperature) is an important physical parameter that reflects climate change.   In order to obtain daily Ta data (Tmax, Tmin, and Tavg) with high spatial and temporal resolution in China, we fully analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of various existing data (reanalysis, remote sensing, and in situ data) ，Different Ta reconstruction models are constructed for different weather conditions, and we further improve data accuracy through building correction equations for different regions. Finally, a dataset of daily temperature (Tmax, Tmin, and Tavg) in China from 1979 to 2018 was obtained with a spatial resolution of 0.1°\n For Tmax, validation using in situ data shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 0.86 °C to 1.78 °C, the mean absolute error (MAE) varies from 0.63 °C to 1.40 °C, and the Pearson coefficient (R2) ranges from 0.96 to 0.99. For Tmin, RMSE ranges from 0.78 °C to 2.09 °C, the MAE varies from 0.58 °C to 1.61 °C, and the R2 ranges from 0.95 to 0.99. For Tavg, RMSE ranges from 0.35 °C to 1.00 °C, the MAE varies from 0.27 °C to 0.68 °C, and the R2 ranges from 0.99 to 1.00. Furthermore, a variety of evaluation indicators were used to analyze the temporal and spatial variation trends of Ta, and the Tavg increase was more than 0.0 °C/a, which is consistent with the general global warming trend.\n In conclusion, this dataset had a high spatial resolution and reliable accuracy, which makes up for the previous missing temperature value (Tmax, Tmin, and Tavg) at high spatial resolution. This dataset also provides key parameters for the study of climate change, especially high-temperature drought and low-temperature chilling damage。",

In the context of creating a temperature dataset for China, this approach results in a dataset with high spatial resolution of 0.1°, reliable accuracy, and improved precision in capturing daily temperature variations (Tmax, Tmin, and Tavg).

Different temperature reconstruction models should be established to accommodate varying weather conditions. Additionally, correction equations should be developed for different regions to enhance data precision. Validation using in-situ data is essential to evaluate the accuracy of Tmax, Tmin, and Tavg with metrics like RMSE, MAE, and Pearson's R2.
