            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Qinghai Lake eddy covariance system (EC) belonging to the Qinghai Lake basin integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2021. The site (100° 29' 59.726'' E, 36° 35' 27.337'' N) was located on the Yulei Platform in Erlangjian scenic area, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3209m. The EC was installed at a height of 16.1m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (Gill&Li7500A) was about 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. \nThe released data contained the following variables: DATE/TIME, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). The quality marks of sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and carbon flux are divided into three levels (quality marks 0 have good data quality, 1 have good data quality and 2 have poor data quality). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format.

                    "Answer": "The observed patterns in wind direction and speed can significantly influence the accuracy and reliability of flux measurements in a dataset collected using eddy covariance methods. Variability in wind direction might affect the alignment of the instruments, especially since the sonic anemometer is oriented with a specific offset, and changes in speed can impact the turbulence characteristics measured by the sensors. These factors are critical because they can alter the micrometeorological conditions required for accurate flux calculations, necessitating adjustments during data processing such as coordinate rotation and frequency response corrections. Furthermore, any deviations from expected wind patterns could lead to the necessity of additional quality checks or the exclusion of certain data segments due to instability or non-stationarity in the atmosphere.",

                    "Answer": "Data gaps or errors in hydrometeorological observations in remote areas like the Qinghai Lake region can be attributed to several factors, such as equipment malfunctions, as seen when the instrument crashed from March 18 to May 30. Additionally, logistical challenges such as the renovation of the Torpedo Launch Base, which led to the removal of instruments, contribute to data gaps. Environmental conditions, like precipitation events, also necessitate data exclusion around these periods, further impacting data continuity.",

                    "Answer": "When instrumentation is temporarily removed and reinstalled at an observational site, such as the situation where instruments were dismantled for site renovations, it can result in data gaps and potential inconsistencies in data continuity. Additionally, there can be challenges in recalibrating instruments and ensuring data quality post-reinstallation, which may affect the comparability of data collected before and after the interruption.",

This data collection aids in understanding surface processes by providing insights into atmospheric stability, turbulence characteristics, and energy exchange between the lake surface and the atmosphere, which are crucial for environmental and climatic studies in the region.",

The data processing involves using Eddypro software to handle raw 10Hz data, applying steps like outlier removal, delay time correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and WPL correction, as well as quality evaluation based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity.",
