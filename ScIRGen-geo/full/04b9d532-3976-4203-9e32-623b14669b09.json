            "description": "The Qinghai Tibet Plateau is known as the \"Asian water tower\", and its runoff, as an important and easily accessible water resource, supports the production and life of billions of people around, and supports the diversity of ecosystems. Accurately estimating the runoff of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and revealing the variation law of runoff are conducive to water resources management and disaster risk avoidance in the plateau and its surrounding areas. The glacier runoff segmentation data set covers the five river source areas of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau from 1971 to 2015, with a time resolution of year by year, covering the five river source areas of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (the source of the Yellow River, the source of the Yangtze River, the source of the Lancang River, the source of the Nujiang River, and the source of the Yarlung Zangbo River), and the spatial resolution is the watershed. Based on multi-source remote sensing and measured data, it is simulated using the distributed hydrological model vic-cas coupled with the glacier module, The simulation results are verified with the measured data of the station, and all the data are subject to quality control.",

This approach involves coupling glacier modules with the model to account for the glacier dynamics. The process includes using multi-source remote sensing data along with actual measurements from monitoring stations to validate the simulation results. Quality control is performed on all collected data to ensure accuracy and reliability over the period from 1971 to 2015, with an annual time resolution and a spatial resolution focused on river basins.",
