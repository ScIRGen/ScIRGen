            "description": "This data includes original images of a new species of Rattus and symbiotic small mammal fossils from the Yangyi Formation of the Upper Neogene in Baoshan, Yunnan, as well as CT (fault) scanning 3D reconstruction models and mapping original images. The main ways to obtain data are through camera field shooting, laboratory depth of field overlay shooting, and CT export. Obtained through professional flat and 3D rendering software such as Photoshop and ArcGIs VGstudio. The image quality is a high-resolution original size image (600 dpi). The prospect of image application is that it can be used for further in-depth research and comparison, which has reference significance for the study of the Cenozoic mammalian population and the systematic classification of rodents.",
