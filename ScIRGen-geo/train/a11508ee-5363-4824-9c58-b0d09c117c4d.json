Additionally, integrating multi-angle reflectance from different periods requires robust modeling to ensure that the derived albedo values reflect true surface conditions over the long-term study period.",

This method facilitates the integration of shortwave band black-sky and white-sky albedo, leading to improved monitoring capabilities for long-term environmental changes.",

This involves a multi-angle, multi-band kernel-driven model that combines intra-month multi-angle red and near-infrared AVHRR reflectance data to retrieve kernel coefficients.
