      "description": "Vulnerability refers to a property of the system that is susceptible to changes in structure and function due to the system's sensitivity to internal and external disturbances and its lack of ability to respond, that is, the ability of the region to cope with disasters to reduce losses when heat waves occur. This dataset is based on the pan-third pole regional road network data, GDP data, medical facility spatial distribution data, vegetation coverage data, and water distribution data as basic data,and takes 2015 as the base year. The Euclidean Metric calculation method is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of road networks, water and medical facilities in the area. The distance from roads, water bodies, medical facilities, GDP, and vegetation coverage are used as evaluation indicators. The equal-weight overlapping addition is used to evaluate the vulnerability of heat waves at each node. In order to eliminate the impact of unit differences, the data of each index layer is normalized before the evaluation.Finally, the vulnerability level of each node is divided by the natural Jenks method.",
      "descriptionCn": "脆弱性是指由于系统对系统内外扰动的敏感性以及缺乏应对能力从而使系统的结构和功能容易发生改变的一种属性，即高温热浪发生时区域应对灾害以减少损失的能力。本数据集以2015年为基准年，泛第三极区域路网数据、GDP数据、医疗设施空间分布数据、植被覆盖度数据、水体分布数据为基础数据。采取欧式距离计算法明确区域内路网、水体及医疗设施的空间分布情况，并以距道路距离、距水体距离、距医疗设施距离、GDP及植被覆盖度为评价指标，采取等权重叠加法评估各节点高温热浪脆弱性。为消除单位差异性带来的影响，评估前对各指标层数据进行归一化处理，最后利用自然间断点法划分各节点脆弱性等级。",

        "AnswerEn": "In this context, 'vulnerability' refers to the attribute of a system that makes its structure and function susceptible to change due to its sensitivity to disturbances from within and outside the system, as well as its lack of coping capacity. Specifically, it relates to the ability of a region to respond to disasters, such as heatwaves, to minimize losses. The vulnerability assessment uses 2015 as the benchmark year and involves key indicators such as distance to roads, water bodies, and medical facilities, as well as GDP and vegetation coverage. These indicators are normalized and evaluated using an equal-weight overlay method to determine the vulnerability levels of various nodes in the region.",

        "AnswerEn": "The vulnerability of regions to high temperature heatwaves is influenced by factors such as the sensitivity of the system to disturbances and the lack of coping capacity, which can change the structure and function of the system. For data collection methods, this involves assessing the spatial distribution of road networks, water bodies, and medical facilities using Euclidean distance calculations. Evaluation indicators like distance from roads, water bodies, medical facilities, GDP, and vegetation coverage are used, and data normalization is performed to eliminate unit differences before assessing vulnerability levels using the natural break method.",
