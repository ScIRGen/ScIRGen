            "description": "On Nov. 18 at 06:34 CST time, an M6.9 earthquake occurred at Mainling prefecture, Nyingchi City, Tibet. This earthquake is located close to the northeastern corner where the Indian plate underthrusts beneath the Eurasian plate. Here the crustal shortening and the tectonically rotated deformation are the strongest with respect to other areas along the whole Himalayan orogenic belt. To record the seismic waveforms, we deployed seismic stations. Due to the huge amount of original waveform data, this database include waveforms of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 3 that occurred between November 18, 2017 and December 31, 2018.",

However, the vast amount of data generated can pose challenges in data management and processing, especially when focusing on significant events, such as those above magnitude 3. This could impact the ability to quickly and effectively analyze and respond to earthquake events.",

This involves understanding the seismic activities, particularly those above magnitude 3, which were recorded between November 18, 2017, and December 31, 2018, following a significant 6.9 magnitude earthquake in Milin County, Tibet. The data aims to provide insights into the interactions between the Indian and Eurasian plates, especially at the northeastern corner where the Indian plate inserts into the Eurasian plate.",
