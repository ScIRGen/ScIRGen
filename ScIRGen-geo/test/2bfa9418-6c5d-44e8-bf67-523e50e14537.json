            "description": "On 2 August 2012 (UTC+8), a Wide-angle Infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner (WIDAS) carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a visible near Infrared thermal Dual-mode airborne remote sensing experiment, which is located in the artificial oasis eco-hydrology experimental area (30×30 km). WIDAS includes an CCD cameras with spatial resolution 0.26 m, a visible near Infrared multispectral camera with five bands scanner (an maximum observation angle 48° and spatial resolution 1.3 m), and a thermal image camera with spatial resolution 6.3 m.\nThe CCD camera data production are recorded in DN values processed by mosaic and orthorectification. The mutispectral camera data production are recorded in reflectance processed by atmospheric and geometric correction. Thermal image camera data production are recorded in radiation brightness temperature processed by atmospheric and geometric correction.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of these sensors allows for capturing data at different resolutions and spectral ranges, providing a comprehensive view of ecological and hydrological phenomena. High-resolution CCD cameras offer detailed spatial information with a resolution of 0.26 meters, which is critical for detecting fine-scale features and changes. Multispectral cameras provide broader spectral information at a 1.3-meter resolution, enabling the analysis of vegetation health and land cover. Thermal imagers capture heat patterns at a 6.3-meter resolution, which can be used to infer water stress and energy fluxes in the landscape. Together, these sensors facilitate a multi-dimensional analysis of the environment, improving the interpretation of spatial and temporal patterns in ecological and hydrological contexts.",
