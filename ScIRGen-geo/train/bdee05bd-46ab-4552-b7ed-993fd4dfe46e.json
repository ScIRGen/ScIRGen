            "description": "Global monthly aerodynamic roughness length dataset is available at a spatial resolution of 0.25° (~25 km), with temporal coverage from January 2010 to December 2020. The aerodynamic roughness length is a key parameter in characterizing aerodynamic resistance in land surface processes and climate-related models, and its accurate estimation is important for the accurate estimation of surface turbulent flux. This dataset is estimated by using the balanced random forest algorithm combining the MODIS, GLASS, and ERA5-land datasets, and the aerodynamic roughness length derived from AmeriFlux, FLUXNET, and the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center eddy observations are used as validation. The validation results indicated that the model estimates were in good agreement against the site observations, and the estimates well captured the seasonal variation trend of the aerodynamic roughness length. The dataset is saved in NetCDF format and contains the variables of the aerodynamic roughness length (in m), longitude and latitude in the range of -180E to 180E and latitude in the range of -90N to 90N, and the coordinate system is WGS84.",

Accurate estimates of z0m with high spatio-temporal resolution at regional and global scale could greatly benefit the improvement of the simulation of land–atmosphere interactions, the development of high spatio-temporal resolution land surface/earth system models, and the better understanding of the Earth-Mankind in the past, nowadays, and future. Over the past decades, substantial physical and empirical methods have been developed to parameterize z0m for different land cover types at different scales. The typical physical method is to deduce z0m by applying logarithmic wind profile equation with meteorological measurements at different levels or by numerically solving the turbulent transfer model. This method is advantageous for its physical basis and spatio-temporal consistency of the z0m estimates, but may be only applicable at restricted sites, largely subject to the uncertainties of involved numerous empirically determined parameters, or almost impossible to accurately estimate the z0m magnitude at regional scale, mesoscale and global scale."

In the validation of the RF-estimated daily z0m with the in-situ observations, the root mean square error (RMSE) varied between 0.02 m and 0.09 m, the mean absolute error (MAE) varied between 0.01 m and 0.05 m and the coefficient of determination (R2) was 1 for medium-to-high canopy shrublands, savannas and forests; for short-canopy croplands, grasslands and wetlands, the RMSE and MAE were 0.02 m and 0.01 m, respectively, and the R2 varied between 0.94 and 1. Compared to the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2, 0.3◦/monthly) and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5, 0.25◦/monthly) products in 2019, the RF-estimated z0m was found to have the similar global spatial pattern but significantly larger temporal variability, and it also showed a higher and lower global mean of z0m over forests and non-forests, respectively.
