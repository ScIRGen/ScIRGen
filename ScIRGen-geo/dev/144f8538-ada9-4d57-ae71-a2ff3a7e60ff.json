            "description": "Vulnerability refers to a property of the system that is susceptible to changes in structure and function due to the system's sensitivity to internal and external disturbances and its lack of ability to respond, that is, the ability of the region to cope with disasters to reduce losses when heat waves occur. This dataset is based on the pan-third pole regional road network data, GDP data, medical facility spatial distribution data, vegetation coverage data, and water distribution data as basic data,and takes 2015 as the base year. The Euclidean Metric calculation method is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of road networks, water and medical facilities in the area. The distance from roads, water bodies, medical facilities, GDP, and vegetation coverage are used as evaluation indicators. The equal-weight overlapping addition is used to evaluate the vulnerability of heat waves at each node. In order to eliminate the impact of unit differences, the data of each index layer is normalized before the evaluation.Finally, the vulnerability level of each node is divided by the natural Jenks method.",

                    "Answer": "In this context, 'vulnerability' refers to the attribute of a system that makes its structure and function susceptible to change due to its sensitivity to disturbances from within and outside the system, as well as its lack of coping capacity. Specifically, it relates to the ability of a region to respond to disasters, such as heatwaves, to minimize losses. The vulnerability assessment uses 2015 as the benchmark year and involves key indicators such as distance to roads, water bodies, and medical facilities, as well as GDP and vegetation coverage. These indicators are normalized and evaluated using an equal-weight overlay method to determine the vulnerability levels of various nodes in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The vulnerability of regions to high temperature heatwaves is influenced by factors such as the sensitivity of the system to disturbances and the lack of coping capacity, which can change the structure and function of the system. For data collection methods, this involves assessing the spatial distribution of road networks, water bodies, and medical facilities using Euclidean distance calculations. Evaluation indicators like distance from roads, water bodies, medical facilities, GDP, and vegetation coverage are used, and data normalization is performed to eliminate unit differences before assessing vulnerability levels using the natural break method.",
