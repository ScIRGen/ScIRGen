            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from a Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System of soil moisture of Daman Superstation from January 1 to December 31, 2019. The site (100.372° E, 38.856° N) was located on a cropland (maize surface) in the Daman irrigation, which is near Zhangye city, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1556 m. The bottom of the probe was 0.5 m above the ground; the sampling interval was 1 hour.\nThe raw COSMOS data include the following: battery (Batt, V), temperature (T, C), relative humidity (RH, %), air pressure (P, hPa), fast neutron counts (N1C, counts per hour), thermal neutron counts (N2C, counts per hour), sample time of fast neutrons (N1ET, s), and sample time of thermal neutrons (N2ET, s). The distributed data include the following variables: Date, Time, P, N1C, N1C_cor (corrected fast neutron counts) and VWC (volume soil moisture, %), which were processed as follows:\n1) Data were removed and replaced by -6999 when (a) the battery voltage was less than 11.8 V, (b) the relative humidity was greater than 80% inside the probe box, (c) the counting data were not of one-hour duration and (d) neutron count differed from the previous value by more than 20%; 2) An air pressure correction was applied to the quality-controlled raw data according to the equation contained in the equipment manual; 3) After the quality control and corrections were applied, soil moisture was calculated using the equation in Zreda et al. (2012), where N0 is the neutron counts above dry soil and the other variables are fitted constants that define the shape of the calibration function. Here, the parameter N0 was calibrated using the in situ observed soil moisture by SoilNET within the footprint; 4) Based on the calibrated N0 and corrected N1C, the hourly soil moisture was computed using the equation from the equipment manual. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Zhu et al. (2015) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

                "The acquisition of regional surface soil moisture has long been a research challenge. In recent years, the study of measuring regional surface soil moisture using cosmic ray fast neutron methods has made significant progress. As a novel medium-scale non-destructive measurement method for soil moisture, the cosmic ray fast neutron method can obtain soil moisture within a source area of approximately 300 meters in radius. This larger measurement area fills the gap between traditional point observations and remote sensing large-area observations. Traditional measurement methods include: gravimetric method (oven-drying method), neutron gauge method, capacitance method, tensiometer method, time-domain reflectometry (TDR), and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR). These measurement methods are all destructive and point-based, with measurement scales mostly at small scales, poor spatial representativeness, and difficulty in obtaining information on the regional distribution of soil moisture. The feasibility study of remote sensing monitoring of soil moisture began in the 1960s, with applied research starting in the mid-1970s. Remote sensing technology can achieve rapid and large-area monitoring of soil moisture, but the soil moisture obtained through remote sensing is an average value at the pixel scale, with spatial resolutions generally ranging from tens of meters (aerial remote sensing) to tens of kilometers (satellite remote sensing), and it only provides instantaneous values at the time of aircraft or satellite overpass, limiting the application of large-scale remote sensing measurements in practical soil moisture monitoring. There is a gap between traditional point measurements and large-scale remote sensing monitoring, which is the inability to obtain regional soil moisture information at the scale of farmland or small watersheds. Similarly, it is not possible to obtain the required pixel-scale soil moisture data during the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture retrievals. In recent years, the research on measuring surface soil moisture using cosmic ray fast neutrons has gradually attracted attention. The intensity of cosmic ray fast neutrons above the surface is inversely related to soil moisture content. By setting up a neutron probe above the surface to measure the intensity of cosmic ray fast neutrons, the surface soil moisture content can be inferred. The cosmic ray fast neutron method is a passive, non-invasive medium-scale soil moisture measurement method, with a measurement radius of about 300 meters and an effective measurement depth of 12 to 76 cm."

Similarly, in the process of validating soil moisture retrieved from remote sensing, it is challenging to acquire the required pixel-scale soil moisture data. Hydrogen atoms in the cosmic ray source region are not only present in soil moisture but also exist in lattice water, soil organic matter, vegetation, and water vapor. The presence of these hydrogen atom sources inevitably affects the propagation of fast neutrons. Zreda et al. pointed out that the presence of lattice water reduces the detection depth of cosmic rays; however, under the assumption that lattice water and soil organic matter remain constant, these effects can be eliminated through a one-time field soil moisture calibration in the source area. In sparsely vegetated areas, the influence of vegetation can also be eliminated based on field soil moisture calibration, but under rapidly growing vegetation, the moisture content of the vegetation has a certain impact on observations, and there is currently no comprehensive method to correct for this. The presence of water vapor affects the measurement source area of cosmic rays, and MCNPX simulations indicate that the detection radius under saturated water vapor is about 10% lower than that under dry air."

Remote sensing can cover large areas quickly, but it provides pixel-scale averages that may not capture continuous data, limiting its application in actual soil moisture monitoring. The cosmic-ray neutron method addresses this gap by offering a medium-scale measurement with a larger measurement radius and depth, providing more representative soil moisture data.",
