            "description": "Soil freeze-thaw is a common phenomenon in the permafrost active layer and seasonally frozen ground on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, currently, there is a lack of quantitative metrics to evaluate the impact of freeze-thaw on the ground surface. Based on the distributions of freeze-thaw disturbance regions (FTDR, specifically landforms of thermal erosion gullies), this dataset defines the freeze-thaw disturbance intensity (FTDI) as the area proportion of the FTDR per unit area. The spatial distribution of FTDR was derived based on a random forest model by integrating Sentinel-2 spectral data (10m resolution) during the growing season (May to September 2020) with sample data from field investigation and indoor analysis. The FTDR dataset was then aggregated to produce the FTDI dataset at a 1km resolution. Validation based on the classification results from high spatial resolution UAV images (2019-2022) shows that the identified FTDR has a high classification accuracy with the producer’s accuracy of 85.95%. This FTDI dataset can effectively characterise the influence of soil freeze-thawing processes on the land surface of the QTP. It will facilitate the quantitative evaluation of the freeze-thaw process, presenting a fresh perspective for examining the impact of freeze-thaw processes on soil quality amidst the backdrop of climate change.",
