            "description": "Precipitation estimates with ﬁne quality and spatio-temporal resolutions play signiﬁcant roles in understanding the global and regional cycles of water, carbon, and energy. Satellite-based precipitation products are capable of detecting spatial patterns and temporal variations of precipitation at ﬁne resolutions, which is particularly useful over poorly gauged regions. However, satellite-based precipitation products are the indirect estimates of precipitation, inherently containing regional and seasonal systematic biases and random errors. Focusing on the potential drawbacks in generating Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) and its recently updated retrospective IMERG in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) era (ﬁnished in July 2019), which were only calibrated at a monthly scale using ground observations, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC, 1.0◦/monthly), we aim to propose a new calibration algorithm for IMERG at a daily scale and to provide a new AIMERG precipitation dataset (0.1◦/half-hourly, 2000–2015, Asia) with better quality, calibrated by Asian Precipitation – Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE, 0.25◦/daily) at the daily scale for the Asian applications. Considering the advantages from both satellite-based precipitation estimates and the ground observations, AIMERG performs better than IMERG at different spatio-temporal scales, in terms of both systematic biases and random errors, over mainland China.",
            "instructions": "File name: AIMERG precipitation dataset is stored as GeoTIFF, and is compressed by year. The name of the compressed file is \"yyyy. 7z\", where yyyy stands for the year. After decompressing, the GeoTIFF file is named \"AIMERG_ yyyymmddhhhh.tif ”Where yyyy is the year, mm is the month, dd is the day, and hhhh is the hour. For example, AIMERG_ 201501010000.tif represents the estimation of precipitation estimates (mm/h) from 0:00 on January 1, 2015 to 1:00 on January 1, 2015 (UTC), over Asia; AIMERG_ 201501010030.tif represents the estimation of precipitation estimates (mm/h) from 0:30 on January 1, 2015 to 1:30 on January 1, 2015, over Asia. If you want to obtain the hourly precipitation, it is necessary to average the two files in the corresponding hourly period.\nData reading method: AIMERG  precipitation dataset in GeoTIFF format can be read by MATLAB, or opened directly by ArcGIS and ENVI software.",

This approach results in reduced systematic bias and random error, particularly in the Chinese region, compared to GPM IMERG, thereby offering a more reliable dataset for research and practical applications in Asia.",
