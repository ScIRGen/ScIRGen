            "description": "The data include the location information of 17 seismic stations in Hanzhong Basin and its surrounding area, the teleseismic receiver function waveform and the crustal S-wave velocity inversed by receiver function and surface wave. Among them, each station includes two receiving functions, the Gaussian coefficient is 2.0, which are in the range of 30-60 ° And 60-90 ° The waveform superimposed within the epicentral distance. Based on the epicentral distance of 30-90 degrees and teleseismic events with magnitude greater than 5.5 recorded by 6 fixed stations set up by China Seismological Bureau for 2 years (2012-2014) and 11 mobile stations set up by Institute of Surveying and Geophysics of Chinese Academy of Sciences in December 2017, the time domain iterative deconvolution method of CPS program is used to extract the receiver function. The results show that the thickness and velocity of shallow sediments are different in different areas of Hanzhong Basin, the velocity changes gently in some areas of Moho, and the distribution of the upper and lower interfaces of focal depth (4-16 km) corresponds to the bottom layer of low velocity body and the top layer of high velocity body. The uploaded data provide valuable data and information for others to further study the structural characteristics of Hanzhong Basin and its adjacent areas.",

                    "Answer": "A '接收函数' (receiver function) is a seismic data processing technique used to isolate and analyze P-to-S converted seismic waves from earthquake recordings. It helps in understanding the subsurface structure by examining the velocity contrasts at different depths. In the context of seismic data collection in the 汉中盆地, receiver functions are used to analyze waveforms from distant earthquakes to infer the S-wave velocity structure and thickness variations in sediment layers, as well as changes in velocities at the Moho boundary.",

                    "Answer": "The variability in S-wave velocity and sediment thickness in different areas of the Hanzhong Basin is influenced by the differences in the shallow sediment layers and the nature of the Moho discontinuity. Additionally, the distribution of interfaces corresponding to low-velocity and high-velocity bodies, as well as the depth of seismic sources (4-16 km), play significant roles in these variations.",

                    "Answer": "Using both fixed and mobile seismic stations can enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of crustal S-wave velocity models by providing a more extensive spatial coverage and capturing a wider range of seismic events. This approach allows for the combination of long-term data from fixed stations with the detailed temporal data from mobile stations, leading to a more robust understanding of regional variations in sediment thickness, Moho discontinuity characteristics, and the distribution of low and high-velocity layers.",

Additionally, the study aims to analyze the smooth velocity changes at the Moho discontinuity and the distribution of upper and lower interfaces of seismic sources, which correspond to low-speed body layers and high-speed body top layers. This data provides valuable insights for further research on the structural characteristics of the Hanzhong Basin and its neighboring areas.",

The time-domain iterative deconvolution method is then applied using CPS software to extract the radial receiver functions, which involves processing waveforms recorded over two years at six fixed stations and one-month data from eleven temporary stations. The extracted waveforms are stacked within epicentral distance ranges of 30-60° and 60-90° using a Gaussian coefficient of 2.0.",

Specifically, 6 fixed stations were used from 2012-2014 and 11 short-period mobile stations set up in December 2017. The CPS program's time-domain iterative deconvolution method was employed to extract the radial receiver function from recordings of events with a magnitude greater than 5.5 and epicentral distances between 30-90 degrees.
