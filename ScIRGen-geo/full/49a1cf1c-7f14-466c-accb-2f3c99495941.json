            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace elements, Sr-Nd isotopic geochemical data, zircon in-situ trace element, Hf-O isotopic and U-Pb dating data of adakitic intrusive rocks. The samples are biotite monzogranite porphyry from the Chongjiang deposit (boreholes CJZK1407 and CJZK1119) in the south of Gangdese, the Tibetan Plateau. The whole rock major element data of the samples from borehole CJZK1407 were obtained by XRF analysis, while the whole rock major element data of the samples from borehole CJZK119 were obtained by ICP-AES analysis. The trace element data of the whole rock samples were obtained by ICP-MS analysis. Sr-Nd isotopic data of whole rock samples were obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. Zircon U-Pb isotopic dating and trace element data were obtained by LA-ICP-MS analysis. Zircon O isotope data were obtained by SHRIMP analysis, and in situ Lu-Hf isotope data were obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data results are true and reliable. The data obtained can be used to study the genesis of adakite and constrain the genesis and tectonic setting of Chongjiang porphyry copper deposit.",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS analysis refers to Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, a technique used for in-situ zircon U-Pb isotopic dating and trace element analysis. It involves using a laser to ablate a small volume of a zircon sample, which is then ionized in a plasma source and analyzed by a mass spectrometer to determine the isotopic composition and trace element concentrations.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of these techniques allows for a comprehensive understanding of the adakitic intrusions' geochemical and isotopic characteristics. By analyzing major and trace elements, along with isotopic data such as Sr-Nd, Hf-O, and U-Pb, researchers can infer the magma source characteristics, the processes of differentiation, and the tectonic setting in which these rocks formed. This multi-faceted approach helps to constrain the origin of the rocks as well as the genetic and structural background of the Chongjiang porphyry copper deposit.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of analytical techniques such as XRF, ICP-AES, and LA-ICP-MS in the data collection of geochemical and isotopic data is influenced by the need for accurate and reliable measurements of major and trace elements, as well as isotopic compositions. XRF is used for major element analysis due to its ability to provide accurate quantification of bulk samples. ICP-AES is chosen for major element analysis when sample size is limited or when higher sensitivity is required. ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS are selected for trace element and isotopic analysis due to their high sensitivity and precision. LA-ICP-MS is employed for in-situ analysis of zircon U-Pb isotopes and trace elements due to its ability to analyze small sample areas with minimal destruction. The choice of these methods ensures comprehensive and precise data collection, necessary for studying the genesis of adakitic rocks and the mineralization processes of copper deposits in the region.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing different analytical methods like XRF and ICP-AES for analyzing major elemental data can lead to variations in accuracy and precision. XRF is a non-destructive technique that can provide rapid results, but its accuracy may be affected by the matrix effects and requires calibration with known standards. ICP-AES, on the other hand, offers higher sensitivity and precision for elemental analysis, particularly for trace elements, but it is a destructive method and requires sample digestion. These differences can influence the interpretation of geological processes and the inferred geochemical environment of the studied rock samples.",
