            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Daman Superstation in the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 6 in 2020. There were two types of LASs at Daman Superstation: BLS900 and RR-RSS460, produced by Germany. The north tower was set up with the BLS900 receiver and the RR-RSS460 transmitter, and the south tower was equipped with the BLS900 transmitter and the RR-RSS460 receiver. The site (north: 100.379° E, 38.861° N; south: 100.369° E, 38.847° N) was located in Daman irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The underlying surfaces between the two towers were corn, orchard, and greenhouse. The elevation is 1556 m. The effective height of the LASs was 24.1 m, and the path length was 1854 m. The data were sampled 1 minute at both BLS900 and RR-RSS460.\nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 exceeded the saturated criterion (BLS900：Cn2>7.25E-14，RR-RSS460：Cn2>7.84 E-14). (2) The data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS900：Average X Intensity<1000；RR-RSS460：Demod>-20mv). (3) The data were rejected when collected during precipitation. (4) The data were rejected if collected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). In the iteration process, the universal functions of Thiermann and Grassl (1992) and Andreas (1988) were selected for BLS900 and RR-RSS460, respectively. Detailed can refer to Liu et al. (2011, 2013). Due to instrument adjustment and inadequate power supply, the date of missing data for the large aperture scintillator is: 2020.06.21-2020.06.23；2020.09.21-2020.10.14. \nSeveral instructions were included with the released data. (1) The data were primarily obtained from BLS900 measurements, and missing flux measurements from the BLS900 instrument were substituted with measurements from the RR-RSS460 instrument. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: Date/time (yyyy/m/d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xlsx format. \nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

(2011, 2013)。由于仪器维修、供电不足和信号问题，大孔径闪烁仪数据缺失的日期为：2020.06.21-2020.06.23；2020.09.21-2020.10.14。\n关于发布数据的几点说明：（1）中游LAS数据以BLS900为主，缺失时刻由RR-RSS460观测补充，两者都缺失则以-6999标记。（2）数据表头：Date/Time ：日期/时间（格式：yyyy/m/d h:mm），Cn2 ：空气折射指数结构参数（单位：m-2/3），H：感热通量（单位：W/m2）。数据时间的含义，如0:30代表0:00-0:30的平均；数据以*.xlsx格式存储。\n黑河流域地表过程综合观测网或站点信息请参考Liu et al.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

                "Therefore, it is critical to maintain the balance between oasis and desert systems in order to achieve the goal of sustainable oasis development. Understanding the basic characteristics of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert ecosystems is important to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the oasis–desert area and support the ecological security and sustainable development of the oasis. A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
