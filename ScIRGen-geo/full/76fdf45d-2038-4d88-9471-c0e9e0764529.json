            "description": "Simply, we use all effective friction velocities derived from the instantaneous estimates of 10 m u-component and v-component hourly wind speeds to infer sand flux based on the physics formulas of blown sand, and according to the existing studies (Gunn et al., 2021; Chanteloube et al., 2022; Gunn et al., 2022a; Gunn et al., 2022b), further improve the conceptual framework of sand flux, and simply define the flux potential (FP), resultant flux potential (RFP) and azimuthal flux potential (FP_N, FP_NNE, FP_NE, FP_NEE, FP_E, FP_EES, FP_ES, FP_ESS, FP_S, FP_SSW, FP_WS, FP_WWS, FP_W, FP_WWN, FP_NW and FP_NNW). Specifically, FP is the sum of FPs moving to all azimuths; RFP is the resultant flux potential, represents net sand transport potential under the different wind directions; RFD is the resultant flux direction, represents net trend of sand flux; FDV is flux directional variability, defined as the ratio of RFP/FP, represents that the flux moves to the same direction (approximate to 1) or many directions (approximate to 0); FP_azimuth represents the azimuthal flux potential, the sum of azimuthal flux potentials is flux potential (FP); RFP_N or RFP_E represent that FPs to all azimuths are projected to the due-north and due-east directions in order to solve the RFP, RFD and the final FDV (Li et al., 2024).\nThe wind speed and direction data calculated by 10 m u-component of wind and 10 m v-component wind were from the 0.1° ERA5-Land hourly wind data during 1950-2023, and the 0.25° ERA5 hourly wind data during 1940-2023.\n",

It is calculated using instantaneous estimates of friction velocity derived from 10m height hourly wind speed data, incorporating both u and v components. The concept is further refined by referencing existing studies, aiming to improve the understanding and definition of sediment transport flux dynamics.",

The approach refines the concept of sediment transport flux by simplifying its definition into categories such as flux potential, resultant flux potential, and azimuthal flux potential. This allows for detailed analysis of sand transport across various directions, and the projection of fluxes onto cardinal directions to calculate resultant flux potential and direction variance, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding sediment transport dynamics globally.",

Additionally, the process involves improving the conceptual framework of sand transport flux by referencing existing studies, simplifying the definitions of various flux potentials, and addressing the directional variability of the flux. The datasets used, which include 0.1° ERA5-Land hourly wind data from 1950-2023 and 0.25° ERA5 hourly wind data from 1940-2023, also contribute to the complexity due to the need for precise data extraction and integration over a long historical period.",

                    "Answer": "The estimation of sand transport flux involves using instantaneous friction velocities derived from hourly wind speeds at 10m height. These velocities are substituted into sand transport physical formulas. The wind speed and direction data are taken from the 0.1° ERA5-Land dataset (1950-2023) and the 0.25° ERA5 dataset (1940-2023). The concept of sand transport flux is further refined by referencing existing studies to define flux potential (FP), resultant flux potential (RFP), and azimuthal flux potential across different directions. This involves calculating the total sand transport flux (FP), net sand transport flux (RFP), and directionality using the directional variance ratio (FDV). The directional flux potentials are calculated for 16 azimuthal directions and projected onto the true north or east to compute the RFP, RFD, and FDV.",
