            "description": "In this dataset, 659 modern fluvial sediment samples originating from the Tibetan Plateau were collected from 31 references, including 542 detrital petrographic data and 497 heavy mineral data. The dataset consists of four tables. The Reference table provides information such as data source, author, age, journal, DOI, etc., while the Sample table provides information such as location, latitude and longitude, sample ID and collection time of the sample. The Petrographic data table provides sediment type, identification method, analyzing window-size, and major clastic components, while the heavy-mineral data table provides sediment type, applied method, analyzing size, heavy mineral concentration and compositional information. All the data have been published in internationally renowned geoscience journals, which guarantee authenticity and reliability of all collected data. This dataset provides information on the sandy petrographic and heavy mineral composition of sediments carried by modern rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas, providing basic data for a comprehensive understanding of the sediments produced in the Tibetan Plateau under the present environment and the differences of sediment components in different rivers, and laying a foundation for assessing the sediment supply and erosion status of different drainage basins. The characteristics of sediment composition of many major rivers in the world are tracked, which provides conditions for exploring the changes of sediment composition during sediment transport process.",
