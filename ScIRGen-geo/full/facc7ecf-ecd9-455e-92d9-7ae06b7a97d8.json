            "description": "The data are 40Ar-39Ar ages of biotites from granitic mylonites and gneissic granites in Yuechengling dome, South China. Firstly, the rock samples were cleaned and crushed, and then the biotite particles were selected by hand under the binocular microscope. Before preparing for dating, biotite was reexamined and fresh, transparent and inclusion free crystals were selected. The experiments were carried out in the Key Laboratory of Geology and Geophysics, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and in the 40Ar / 39Ar and U-Th / he laboratories. Mm5400 mass spectrometer was used to measure 40Ar / 39Ar with high resolution. Then, arcalc, a plug-in of Excel, is used to further process the original data. The data provide chronological support for the explanation of the formation process and dynamic mechanism of Yuechengling dome.\nThe above data have been published in tectonics, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored in the form of Excel.",

                "Crustal extension is a common phenomenon in back‐arc regions of subduction zones, such as the Aegean and western North America. Within extensional tectonics, normal faults play an important role to accommodate the stretching of continental crust by exhuming middle‐lower crustal units. A major portion of East China has experienced large‐scale extension within back‐arc regions of the Late Mesozoic Paleo‐Pacific subduction system. The South China Block (SCB), which was amalgamated with the North China Block (NCB) by the Qinling‐Dabie orogeny, displays a similar extensional scenario. The Paleo‐Pacific oceanic plate subducted westward beneath the SCB. The eastern part of the SCB experienced intense Early Paleozoic deformation‐metamorphism‐magmatism, which not only reworked most of the Neoproterozoic structures but obliterated Neoproterozoic petrological records by amphibolite‐facies or granulite‐facies metamorphism, migmatization, and widespread intrusions. Since the Late Mesozoic, the Paleo‐Pacific subduction at the eastern continental margin of the SCB started to influence the surface stress field in a wide region from the coastal regions to the Xuefengshan Belt at the center. Then arc‐related magmatism and regional extension became the major characteristics in response to the interaction between the two plates."
