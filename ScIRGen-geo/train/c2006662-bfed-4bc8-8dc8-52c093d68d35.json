            "description": "The dataset is the land surface temperature (LST) product of 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau. The dataset is retrieved based on Landsat images and a practical single-channel (PSC) algorithm. When validated with the simulation data set, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the PSC algorithm was 1.23 K. The corresponding quality assessment (QA) product is also generated to identify cloud, cloud shadow, ice and snow. LST is a commonly used land surface parameter, which can provide data product support for the research and applications in resources survey, ecological environment monitoring, global change research and other fields.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the land surface temperature products of each scene are stored in a folder including the LST band, QA file, metadata, and browse image; the name rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LST\", for example, L8-TIRS-140-034-20181227-LST;the LST band is stored in GeoTIFF format and its name rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LST-BX(X represents band number).TIF\", for example, \"L8-TIRS-140-034-20181227-LST-B10.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset: the surface temperature products can be opened by ArcGIS, Envi, QGIS and so on.The land surface temperature results must be multiplied by 0.1 before used, and its unit is Kelvin. The background filling value is 0, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
