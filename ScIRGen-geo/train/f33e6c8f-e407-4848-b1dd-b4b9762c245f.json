Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness of only tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), in contrast to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS can better match the pixel scale of satellite imagery and the grid scale of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth at the pixel/grid scale for remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."
