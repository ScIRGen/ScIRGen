            "titleEn": "GEOCHRONOLOGICAL data of Muscovite from Huangjindong gold deposit, Northeastern Hunan Province",
            "description": "In 2020, the selection of Muscovite will be completed in Hebei Chengxin Service Co., Ltd. the samples will be crushed to more than 20 mesh by conventional methods, and about 200 mg Muscovite will be selected from each sample under binocular lens, with the purity of Muscovite more than 99%. The selected samples were first sent to B4 channel of 49-2 reactor of China Academy of atomic energy for neutron irradiation. The Muscovite sample was wrapped into a 6 mm sphere with pure aluminum platinum paper, sealed in a quartz glass bottle, and wrapped with 0.5 mm thick CD skin. The irradiation time was 30 hours, and the fast neutron flux was 2.2576 × 1018。 At the same time, the pure substances CaF2 and K2SO4 were irradiated simultaneously, and the correction factors were obtained as follows: (36Ar / 37Ar) Ca = 0.000271, (39Ar / 37Ar) Ca = 0.000652, (40Ar / 39Ar) k = 0.00703. The irradiated sample is cooled, put into the sample rack, sealed and degassed, and then put into the system.\nThe sample dy02 was sent to the Key Laboratory of orogenic belt and crustal evolution, Peking University for AR Ar dating. The rga10 mass spectrometer was used for the test. The detailed test process is shown in hall and Farrell (1995). Five groups of Ar isotope signals were recorded by mass spectrometer, and the signal intensity unit was MV. Blank samples were measured once every three tests. The detailed method of data processing is shown in nomade et al. (2005). Samples 14jm14 and 14jm15 were sent to China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) for AR Ar dating. The instrument used in the test was Argus VI mass spectrometer. The detailed testing process is shown in Qiu et al. (2015), and the detailed data processing method is shown in Koppers (2002)",

This method, when combined with correction factors from simultaneous irradiation of pure substances, results in accurate age determination.
