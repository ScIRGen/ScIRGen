            "description": "The dataset of spectral reflectance of canopy leafs observed by the integrating sphere was obtained by ASD Spectroradiometer (350～2 500 nm) and integrating spheres from BNU and the reference board (40% before Jun. 15 and 20% hereafter), in the Linze station foci experimental area. Maize quadrate, the desert green quadrate and withered scrub quadrate in Linze station (on May 28, 30, Jun. 19, 30 and Jul. 9), Wulidun farmland quadrates (on Jun. 24, 29 and Jul. 11) and the desert strips were measured. According to the fact that the ratio of the two DN values equals that of their reflectivity, the reflectivity and the tranmittivity can be calculated with the caliberation coefficient, reflection DN of the observed objects and reference plates. The reflectivity and the tranmittivity of interior vegetation leaves can be got by the integrating spheres.\n     Raw spectral data were archived as binary files, which were recorded daily in detail, and pre-processed data on reflectance and transmittivity were archived as text files (.txt).",

This method involves positioning a light source and a leaf sample in specific orientations relative to the integration sphere, and using a reference panel to calibrate the measurements. The reflectance is measured by directing the light source at the sample with the leaf facing the inner wall of the sphere, while transmittance is measured by placing the light source on the same side as the sample with the leaf facing the light source. The reflectance or transmittance of the target object is calculated by comparing the DN values of the target and reference board.",

This method involves careful positioning and calibration to obtain accurate reflectance and transmittance values. In contrast, alternative remote sensing methods might utilize satellite or airborne sensors to capture vegetation properties over larger areas, relying on different spectral bands and possibly providing less granular data but covering more extensive regions. The integrating sphere method offers precise, controlled data collection for specific plant samples, whereas remote sensing provides broader but potentially less detailed vegetation assessments.",

                    "Answer": "The need to use different reference boards, such as switching from a 40% reference board to a 20% one, arises from the requirement to ensure accurate calibration of the spectrometer based on varying lighting conditions and measurement precision. The choice of reference board can be influenced by the specific reflectance properties of the plant species being studied and the environmental conditions during the observation period.",

The reflectance measurement is achieved by positioning the light source directly at the sample aperture with the leaf's upper surface facing the inner wall of the integrating sphere and the lower surface facing a black body cover. For transmittance measurement, the light source is on the same side as the sample aperture, with the leaf's upper surface facing the light source and the lower surface facing the inner wall of the integrating sphere. Reflectance and transmittance are calculated by comparing the DN values of the target and a reference panel, using known calibration coefficients of the reference panel. Observations were conducted at various sample plots, and data was stored in binary and text formats for further processing.",
