The water was collected with 100mL polyethylene (PE) plastic bottle, and the basic physical and chemical parameters such as pH value (±0.2) and dissolved oxygen (±1%) of the sampling site were measured by multi -parameter water quality monitor (YSI-EX02,USA).,and HCO3- concentration was titrated with 0.025mol/L HCl.The concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, NO3- and Cl- ions were analyzed and determined by ion chromatograph (Shenhan CIC-D160, China) in the laboratory. Using Gibbs model, correlation analysis and principal component analysis method, analyzed the one main ion concentration changes,  chemical composition characteristics, analytical, and the ion source was designed to reveal inorganic water chemical characteristics of The Tibet plateau glacier melt water runoff, and for plateau typical river water and changing trend forecast provides the basis.",

                    "Answer": "In-situ measurements using a multi-parameter water quality monitor provide immediate data on basic physicochemical parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen, which are crucial for understanding the immediate water quality conditions. Meanwhile, laboratory analysis using ion chromatography offers detailed information on specific ion concentrations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, NO3-, and Cl-, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the water's inorganic chemistry. Together, these methods complement each other by covering both immediate and detailed chemical characteristics of the river water.",

Sampling was carried out using 100ml polyethylene (PE) plastic bottles, and multi-parameter water quality monitors were used to measure parameters like pH and dissolved oxygen on-site. The selection of these methods ensures precise measurement of basic physical and chemical parameters necessary for analyzing ion concentrations and understanding the chemical composition of high-altitude river water.",

This approach allows for accurate characterization of ion sources, helping to reveal specific hydrochemical characteristics of glacier meltwater runoff on the Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, it supports a robust basis for analyzing the water sources and predicting changes in typical river systems in high-altitude regions.",
