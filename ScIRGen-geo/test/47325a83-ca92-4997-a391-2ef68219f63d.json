            "description": "1) Data content\nThis data set includes lake evaporation data of Bamco, La'angco in the summer and autumn of 2019-2021 and Longmuco in the summer and autumn of 2020-2021. The meteorological data required for the calculation of evaporation data are obtained from the automatic meteorological station set up at the lake side, with the observation height of 1.5m.\nLake location: Bamco (90.59 ° E, 31.29 ° N), La'anco (81.24 ° E, 30.72 ° N), Longmucuo (80.47 ° E, 34.60 ° N).\nCoordinates of automatic weather stations: Bamco AWS (90.65 ° E, 31.30 ° N), La'anco AWS (81.22 ° E, 30.73 ° N), and Longmucuo AWS (80.43 ° E, 34.59 ° N).\nTime resolution: 1d\nSpatial resolution:-\nUnit: mm\n2) Data source and processing method\nIntegral conveying method. The calculation formula is as follows:\nLH=l_ v  ρ_ a c_ E U(q_s-q_a )\nE=LH/( ρ l_ v )\nLH and E are latent heat and evaporation respectively.\nThe automatic weather station erected near the lake is used for meteorological data, and the observation data used include temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, etc. at 1.5m; Lake surface temperature uses ERA5 land hourly data; The momentum roughness, moisture roughness and thermal roughness are obtained by back calculation from the data obtained by the eddy correlation instrument erected by Bamco and Laoncho.\n3) Data quality description\nThe evaporation data of Bamco Lake in 2020 obtained by calculation are compared with the evaporation data from August to October obtained by the eddy correlation instrument installed on the central island of Bamco Lake. Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.57, p=2.842E-8.\n4) Data application achievements and prospects\nWater surface evaporation is an important link in the process of water cycle and an important topic in hydrology research. As the main part of lake water loss, it is also the basic reference data for studying land surface evaporation. The evaporation calculated based on the observation data can be used as the accurate evaporation of lakes on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, which is an important basis for studying the water balance of lakes. By obtaining the evaporation of three lakes located in different climatic regions, we can better explore the variation law of lake water surface evaporation in different climatic regions.",

                "Lakes have a lower albedo and roughness length but a larger heat capacity than surrounding land areas covered with vegetation (Venäläinen et al. 1999). Energy exchange between a lake surface and deeper water is more effective than that between land surface and deeper soil. Heat and water vapour transfer over lakes have been extensively studied in past decades (Thiery et al. 2014b; Venäläinen et al. 1999), though rare in the Tibetan Plateau. The Tibetan Plateau has an average elevation of 4000 m above sea level and contains numerous lakes covering a total area of approximately 45,000 km², including more than a thousand lakes with individual areas greater than 1.0 km². This results in a very heterogeneous landscape (Xu et al. 2009). The role of the Tibetan Plateau in the global water cycle and the plateau’s reaction to climate change is a hot topic (Immerzeel et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2014). In the Tibetan Plateau, solar radiation is relatively high, whereas the air density and the pressure are only 50–60% of the values found at sea level. The particular geography and climate environment create unique land–atmosphere interaction in the Tibetan Plateau (Ma et al. 2009). However, most previous long-term observations have focused on alpine grassland and wetland (Zhao et al. 2010) and lacked targeted observation of lakes."

                "Field experiments alone are not enough to study lake–atmosphere interaction, because flux observations over lakes are difficult to carry out widely in the Tibetan Plateau due to problems of accessibility, waves, and ice cover during winter. However, parameterization schemes in most lake models still come from ocean observations. This can result in inaccurate lake simulations due to the differences between sea and lake such as waves, fetch length, and depth. In recent years, it was found that under weak wind, the roughness length was likely affected by small-scale capillary waves or the surface tension over the water body, but these physical considerations were not included in most lake models."

                "The observation platform was located in the northwest region of Lake Ngoring, installed on a submerged rock about 1.0 m below the water surface, 200 m to the northwest lakeshore and 50 m to the southwest island, with a depth of 3–5 m within 200 m around the platform. An eddy covariance system (EC) was mounted 3 m above the lake surface to measure turbulent fluxes (momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat flux). This consisted of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) and an open-path CO2/H2O infrared gas analyser (LI 7500, LI-COR, Inc.). Air temperature and humidity were measured with a temperature and humidity probe (HMP45C, Vaisala) at 3 m height. The incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiations were measured with a net radiometer (CNR-1, Kipp and Zonen) 1.5 m above the lake surface. The sensor signals were recorded by a data logger (CR5000, Campbell Scientific, Inc.) at a frequency of 10 Hz. Post-processing of 10 Hz original data was performed using EddyPro 4.1 flux analysis software (LI-COR, Inc.). Virtual temperature was converted to air temperature, and corrections were made for time lag compensation; spike and trend removal and coordinate rotation were performed. The coordinate rotation for tilt correction was implemented using the double rotation method, and the Webb–Pearman–Leuning density correction was applied to the latent heat flux. We removed data with automatic gain control (AGC) values (output from the LI 7500) greater than 70. All turbulent fluxes and meteorological variables were processed in 30 min averaging intervals. Sporadic missing data were replaced through interpolation combined with other meteorological variables such as wind velocity, radiation, and temperature (specific humidity) differences between the lake’s surface and air."

Under weak wind conditions, the surface tension or small scale capillary wave becomes more important and increases the surface roughness. The scalar roughness length ratio was much larger than unity under weak wind conditions, and it decreased to values near unity as wind velocity exceeded 4.0 m s−1. The lake model could not reproduce well the variation of drag coefficient, or momentum roughness length, versus wind velocity in Lake Ngoring, but it did simulate well the sensible heat and latent heat fluxes, as a result of complementary opposite errors."

It typically consists of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer and an open-path CO2/H2O infrared gas analyser, which help in capturing the exchange processes between the lake and the atmosphere.",

Unlike traditional meteorological measurements that might not capture these fluxes, the eddy covariance system can help identify variations in transfer coefficients and roughness lengths for momentum, heat, and moisture, thereby offering a deeper insight into these interactions, especially under varying wind conditions.",

This can lead to discrepancies in evaporation simulations, particularly in diverse climatic zones such as those found on the Tibetan Plateau. The inaccuracies could result in misrepresenting the drag coefficient and momentum roughness length, which are critical for simulating lake-atmosphere heat fluxes accurately.

Additionally, eddy covariance instruments are used to gather data on momentum, heat, and moisture, which help in deriving roughness parameters.

This includes using a sonic anemometer and an infrared gas analyzer to capture momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes. Data processing involves post-processing using specialized software to correct for time lags, spike removal, and coordinate rotation. This technique overcomes challenges such as waves and ice cover by providing continuous data during ice-free periods.",
