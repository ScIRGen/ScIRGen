            "description": "The data set includes the observation data of river water level and velocity at No. 4 point in the dense observation of runoff in the middle reaches of Heihe River from January 1 to June 25, 2014. The observation point is located in Heihe bridge, Shangbao village, Jing'an Township, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The riverbed is sandy gravel with unstable section. The longitude and latitude of the observation point are n39 ° 03'53.23 \", E100 ° 25'59.31\", with an altitude of 1431m and a width of 58m. In 2012, hobo pressure type water level gauge was used for water level observation with acquisition frequency of 30 minutes; since 2013, sr50 ultrasonic distance meter was used with acquisition frequency of 30 minutes. The data description includes the following parts:            \nFor water level observation, the observation frequency is 30 minutes, unit (CM); the data covers the period from January 1, 2014 to June 25, 2014; for flow observation, unit (M3); for flow monitoring according to different water levels, the water level flow curve is obtained, and the runoff change process is obtained based on the observation of water level process. The missing data is uniformly represented by string-6999.            \nRefer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or station information and he et al.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
