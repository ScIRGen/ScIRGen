The samples were collected from the Darucuo area in central Tibet, including granodiorite, monzonite, syenite, andesite, dacite, rhyolite, sandstone, and slate. The whole-rock major elements were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) on fused glass disks and trace elements were measured using an Agilent Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry system. The zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes are obtained by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopes are obtained by analysis of sample separation and multiple collector-inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer. The zircon O isotopes are analyzed by secondary ion probe. The data can be used for constraining the age, petrogenesis, and geodynamic settings of magmatism, and provenance analysis of sedimentary rocks.",

The magmatic systems that develop on the upper plate during subduction and initial collision record the processes of convergence and orogenesis (Cawood et al., 2009; Stern, 2002; Zhu et al., 2019). The E‐W trending Bangong‐Nujiang suture (BNS; Figures 2a and 2b) in central Tibet separates the Lhasa and Qiangtang Terranes (Kapp & DeCelles, 2019; Zhu et al., 2016). Assembly of the terranes is related to an overall environment of ocean closure and continental collision, but a range of drivers and kinematic scenarios have been invoked for northward subduction based on the rock archive within the BNS and Qiangtang Terrane, including subduction initiation inferred from ophiolites (188–165 Ma; Figure 1a; Tang, Zhai, Hu, Xiao, et al., 2018) and high‐Mg andesites (approximately 163 Ma; Y.C. Zeng, Chen, et al., 2016), Lhasa‐Qiangtang collision on the basis of angular unconformities (approximately 166 Ma; Figure 1d; Ma et al., 2017; Li, Guilmette, et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018), and ridge subduction from a rock association of adakites and oceanic island basalt (OIB)‐type rocks (160–148 Ma; Figure 1c; S.M.

For the igneous rocks, zircon U‐Pb dating was undertaken on 12 samples, which display oscillatory zoning under cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging. For each sample, 18–30 spots were analyzed and the U‐Pb data were divisible into two age groups (166–163 and 114–112 Ma). Geochemical compositions and zircon Hf‐O isotopes of samples from the older group, which is the focus of this study, were also determined. For the nine sandstone samples, both rim and core of detrital zircons as determined by CL imaging were analyzed with 100–140 spots for each sample. All zircon U‐Pb isotopes were analyzed via laser ablation‐inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, following the methods described in Zhang et al. (2019)."

The Beila‐Nagqu mélange belt and the Daoban formation, to the south and north of the 166–160 Ma arc, formed contemporaneously and were sourced from the arc. Our new data in the eastern segment, along with existing data in the western segment of the suture, imply the development of an overall compressional convergent margin extending over 1,200 km along strike during Middle‐Late Jurassic. A subparallel ridge‐subduction zone interaction event provides a viable model to explain the diverse geological records of the BNS and Qiangtang Terrane and involves subparallel ridge‐trench collision (170–160 Ma), slab window formation (160–148 Ma), and subsequent subduction termination (148–125 Ma)."
