It involves nesting a higher resolution simulation within a larger scale model to provide more detailed climate information, such as daily precipitation and near-surface air temperature, over specific regions like southeast Asia.",

In contrast, other regional climate models with coarser resolutions may not employ such nested downscaling techniques, potentially relying on less detailed input data and simpler models, which could lead to differences in spatial accuracy and detail.",

This is particularly important because regional models like WRF can capture local topographical features and climatic variations that global models like ERA5 might miss due to their coarser resolution, thereby providing more precise and reliable data for local climate studies.",
