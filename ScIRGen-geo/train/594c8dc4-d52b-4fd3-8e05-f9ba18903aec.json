            "description": "Collect daily meteorological data from 1980 to 2018 from the Meteorological Data Sharing Center of China Meteorological Administration, through Anusplin professional meteorological interpolation software, monthly, annual temperature and precipitation calculated by each meteorological station to obtain a 1km resolution spatial data set, rainfall calculation process The attribute values of medium grids are all expanded by 10 times. These data are collected and analyzed by the project team personnel, and the authenticity and reliability of the data can be guaranteed. Aiming at the problem of land use change in the typical Zoige watershed caused by climate change in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we collected climate indicators to obtain long-term climate characteristics and trends in the typical watershed.Using spatial data sets to simulate the spatiotemporal pattern of typical water and soil ecosystem services such as ecosystem production, carbon fixation, hydrological regulation, and soil conservation, revealing the spatiotemporal change pattern of water and soil ecosystem services at the basin scale, combining climate change, socioeconomic data and ecological environment protection Policy implementation, land use transformation and other factors, combined with trade-off analysis and structural equation modeling to quantify these water-soil ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies based on soil and water processes, and identify the main driving forces of typical water and soil ecosystem services at the basin scale, which is more important for Ruoergai wetland. Effective and more scientific ecological protection and multi-objective land use optimization management provide theoretical support.",
            "instructions": "File naming: The index data of the earth's key belts is stored in a raster format, and the file names are HI_XXXXyear; EEMT_XXXX; PET_PMXXXX_XX; precip_MXXXX_XX. HI stands for Humidity Index; EEMT stands for effective energy and material transfer; PET stands for potential evapotranspiration; precip stands for temperature and precipitation; XXXX stands for year; XX stands for month. For example, HI_2011year stands for the status of the humidity index in 2011. Plant and soil survey data are stored in Excel and JPG format. The name of the soil survey data file is \"Typical land use types and typical slope soil data in Hongyuan County, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2019\", and the name of the plant community survey data file is JDXXX And WQXXX, where JD and WQ represent sampling locations, and XXX represents different types of sampling. Data reading method: All the files in the data set of the Earth's key belt indicators can be directly opened with ArcGIS. During the reading process, a grid format file will be generated, and the displayed grid file is the graphic representation of the file. Plant community and soil survey data can be opened with Excel and photo viewers.",
