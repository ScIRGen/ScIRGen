            "description": "The 2008 national remote sensing annual average surface temperature and freezing index is a 5 km instantaneous surface temperature data product based on MODIS Aqua/Terra four times a day by Ran Youhua et al. (2015). A new method for estimating the annual average surface temperature and freezing index has been developed. The method uses the average daily mean surface temperature observed by LST in morning and afternoon to obtain the daily mean surface temperature. The core of the method is how to recover the missing data of LST products.  The method has two characteristics: (1) Spatial interpolation is carried out on the daily surface temperature variation observed by remote sensing, and the spatial continuous daily surface temperature variation obtained by interpolation is utilized, so that satellite observation data which is only once a day is applied;  (2) A new time series filtering method for missing data is used, that is, the penalty least squares regression method based on discrete cosine transform.\nVerification shows that the accuracy of annual mean surface temperature and freezing index is only related to the accuracy of original MODIS LST, i.e. the accuracy of MODIS LST products is maintained.  It can be used for frozen soil mapping and related resources and environment applications.",
