                "Central Asia is an extensive arid and semiarid region located in the mid-latitude of the Eurasian continent. Central Asia is located in the hinterland of Eurasia. It has a typical temperate continental climate of deserts and grasslands because the plateau in its southeast blocks the warm and humid air inflow from the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Central Asia is characterized by three features. First, the rainfall is scarce with annual precipitation generally below 300 mm, thus the region is extremely dry. Central Asia is the key connecting region along the Silk Road Economic Belt that extends from East Asia to Europe. This region is facing severe water shortages and societal conflicts as a result of the dry climate. This region is controlled by a typical continental climate with little precipitation and high evaporation, with highly sensitive to climate change. Additionally, significant shrink of glaciers, reduction of snow cover, and decline of lake sizes have been observed in Central Asia due to global warming and impacts of other anthropogenic activities during recent decades. In-situ observations are scarce in Central Asia, and the spatial resolutions of gridded observational products and reanalysis are commonly coarse. Many studies have illustrated that land surface processes have significant impacts on water vapor and momentum exchanges between land and atmosphere, which in turn affect the nature of atmospheric circulation and even causes climate feedback in the long term. Therefore, the performance of WRF should be highly dependent of the land surface scheme, which largely determines the land surface processes in RCM. However, the studies focusing on the sensitivity of RCM to land surface schemes over Central Asia are rare. The resolution of RCM is another crucial factor that affects its downscaling ability. Increased resolution can more realistically represents regional land surface feature, such as topography and underlying surface conditions."

It is found that the performance of WRF model varies with regions, seasons and climatic conditions, owing to various factors such as the atmospheric circulation natural variability, the physical parameterization schemes, the size, location and resolution of simulation domain, the lateral boundary conditions, and the representation of land surface conditions."

The simulations, however, are sensitive to the option of land surface scheme. The performance of Exp-CLM4 and Exp-SSiB are better than that of Exp-Noah-MP and Exp-PX assessed by Multivariable Integrated Evaluation (MVIE) method. The results demonstrate that the sensible and latent heat fluxes are respectively lower by 30.42 W·m −2 and higher by 14.86 W·m−2 in Ave-CLM4-SSiB than that in Ave-NoahMP-PX. As a result, large differences in geopotential height occur over the simulation domain. The simulated wind fields are subsequently influenced by the geostrophic adjustment process, thus the simulations of 2-m temperature, surface skin temperature and precipitation are respectively lower by about 2.08 ℃, 2.23 ℃ and 18.56 mm·month−1 in Ave-CLM4-SSiB than that in Ave-NoahMP-PX over Central Asia continent."
