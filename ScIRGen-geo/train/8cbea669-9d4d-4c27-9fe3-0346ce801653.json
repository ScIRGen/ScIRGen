            "description": "The data of aquatic organisms and fish in Kekexili area of Qinghai Province are from the comprehensive scientific investigation in Kekexili area carried out from May to August 1990. The first survey of aquatic organisms was carried out in the waters of gaerqu trunk tributary, upper reaches of tuotuotuo River, mazhangcuoqin, gangqiqu, upper reaches of chumar River, wulanwulahu, Taiyang lake, bukadaban peak and wuxuefeng, respectively 42 bottles of plankton samples and more than 300 fish samples were obtained. In addition, Wu Yunfei and others collected 26 collection points from the source of Tuotuo River, the source of Buqu River and the tidal pools and hot spring streams near bendeco lake, Tuotuo River and Yanshiping in 19731975 and 1986 respectively. Among them, 18 points collected more than 500 fish numbers, and 12 points collected 54 bottles of aquatic organisms. Now we collate them together to provide valuable real data for future research in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai Province.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format and contains six workbooks. They are: 1. Composition and distribution of aquatic organisms in various waters of Hoh Xil area; 2. Distribution of fishes in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai Province; 3. Feeding objects of fishes in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai Province; 4. Calculation of average body length from 1 to 10 years old of barebellied leaf barbed fish and small head naked Schirmer; 5 6. The relationship between the water systems in Kekexili and its neighboring areas in Qinghai Province. The table introduces in detail some valuable data such as the feeding objects and average body length of aquatic organisms and fish in Kekexili area.",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method involved conducting a comprehensive scientific survey from May to August 1990 in various water bodies of the Qinghai Kekexili area, such as the tributaries of the Garqu River at the source of the Yangtze, the upper reaches of the Tuotuo River, and several lakes and streams. This survey resulted in the collection of 42 bottles of plankton specimens and over 300 fish specimens, along with relevant observational records. Additionally, historical data from surveys conducted in 1973, 1975, and 1986 were also compiled, covering 26 collection points where fish and aquatic organisms were sampled.",

                    "Answer": "A comprehensive scientific investigation in the context of aquatic organisms and fish data collection involves conducting systematic surveys and observations at various sites within a region, as evidenced by the study conducted in the Qinghai Hoh Xil area from May to August 1990. This includes collecting specimens of plankton and fish across diverse water bodies such as tributaries and lakes, and gathering detailed observational data. Historical data from previous surveys in 1973, 1975, and 1986 also contribute to this comprehensive approach by providing additional specimens and data points from different collection sites.",

                    "Answer": "The sampling locations were influenced by the aim to cover various water bodies in the region, including tributaries, river headwaters, lakes, and streams, to provide comprehensive data on aquatic organisms and fish. The specific sites included areas like the tributaries of the Galadandong at the Yangtze River's source, the upper reaches of the Tuotuo River, the Mazhang Cuo Qin, the Gangqi River, the upper reaches of the Chumar River, Ulan Ula Lake, and others. The choice was likely driven by the diversity and representation of habitats within the Qinghai Kekexili region.",

                    "Answer": "The goal of conducting a comprehensive scientific investigation of aquatic organisms and fish in the Qinghai Hoh Xil area is to gather authentic and valuable data for future research. This involves collecting specimens and observation records from various water bodies in the region, which can provide insights into the biodiversity, ecology, and environmental conditions of the area. The intended outcomes include establishing a baseline understanding of aquatic life, aiding in conservation efforts, and facilitating further scientific studies.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involved in conducting a comprehensive aquatic biological and fish survey in remote areas such as Qinghai's Hoh Xil region include organizing a systematic scientific expedition during specified months (May to August), targeting various key water bodies and tributaries. Collection involves gathering specimens of plankton and fish—42 bottles of plankton specimens and over 300 fish specimens were collected in the initial survey. The methodology also includes revisiting historical collection points, such as those used by Wu Yunfei in the 1970s and 1980s, to collect additional specimens and data. This approach provides a valuable dataset for future research by ensuring that data from different times and collection points are compiled and preserved to maintain consistency and accuracy in the region's aquatic biodiversity studies.",
