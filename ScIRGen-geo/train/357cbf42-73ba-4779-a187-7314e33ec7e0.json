            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace elements, whole rock SR Nd isotope, zircon U-Pb dating and Lu Hf isotope data of Xitian DENGFUXIAN composite pluton in the middle qinhang metallogenic belt. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The whole rock SR Nd isotopes were obtained by MC – ICP – MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can analyze (1) the internal relations and differences between the two composite rock masses（ 2) The Triassic granitic magmatism did not cause W-Sn mineralization（ 3) The physical and chemical conditions of granite magma（ 4) The genesis of tin tungsten mineralization in the tin tungsten ore field and Dengfu County ore field.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using XRF for major elements and ICP-MS for trace elements both serve different but complementary roles in geochemical analysis. XRF provides accurate measurements for major elements, suitable for understanding the bulk composition of rocks, while ICP-MS offers high sensitivity and precision for trace elements, allowing for detailed geochemical characterization.

                    "Answer": "The differences in geochemical data collection methods are influenced by the need to accurately analyze various elements and isotopes. For major elements, XRF analysis is used due to its effectiveness in determining the bulk composition. Trace elements require the sensitivity of ICP-MS analysis. Zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu-Hf isotope compositions are best analyzed with LA-MC-ICP-MS for precision and accuracy. Whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopes are collected using MC–ICP–MS to obtain precise isotopic ratios. These methods are selected to ensure reliable data that can be used to explore the intrinsic connections and differences between composite rock bodies and to understand the geochemical conditions that did not lead to tungsten-tin mineralization.",

                    "Answer": "Using inconsistent data collection methods, such as XRF for major elements, ICP-MS for trace elements, and LA-MC-ICP-MS for zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotope data, could lead to challenges in accurately comparing the intrinsic relationships and differences between composite rock bodies. This inconsistency might affect the understanding of the reasons Triassic granitic magmatism did not cause tungsten-tin mineralization, as well as the determination of the physicochemical conditions of granitic magma.",

                    "Answer": "The collection of geochemical data on major and trace elements, Sr-Nd isotopes, zircon U-Pb dating, and Lu-Hf isotopes is crucial for analyzing the intrinsic relationships and differences between composite plutons. It helps understand the Triassic granitic magmatism, its lack of causing tungsten-tin mineralization, and the physicochemical conditions of granitic magma, as well as the genesis of tungsten-tin mineralization in specific mineral fields.",
