            "description": "This data set is the physical property data of Hengduan Mountain Glacier, reflecting the temperature condition of Hengduan Mountain Glacier. It was observed on Baishui No.1 glacier on the east slope of Yulong Mountain and dagongba glacier on the west slope of Gongga Mountain by the comprehensive scientific investigation team of Qinghai Tibet Plateau of Chinese Academy of Sciences from 1982 to 1984. The temperature field location, altitude, drilling information, ice surface condition, sampling time, sampling depth and measured temperature of Baishui No. 1 glacier on the east slope of Yulong and dagongba glacier on the west slope of Gongga are recorded in detail in the data, which are obtained from field investigation and calculation. At the same time, the velocity data of dagongba glacier and the surface strain rate, normal strain rate and its error and principal strain rate at 4700m of Baishui No.1 glacier in Yulongshan are available. This data is of great significance to the study of temperature and movement of glacial active layer in Hengduan Mountain area.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format and can be used by Microsoft The Excel software in office includes seven workbooks, which are glacier temperature observation field, Baishui No.1 glacier temperature data, dagongba glacier temperature data, dagongba glacier ice surface velocity measurement table, Yulongshan Baishui No.1 glacier 4700m surface strain rate, normal strain rate and its error and principal strain rate. All data are obtained from field survey.",

                    "Answer": "In glacier data collection, '温度场位置' (temperature field location) refers to the specific areas on the glacier where temperature measurements are taken. It includes the precise positioning within the glacier, which is important for understanding the spatial distribution of temperature across different parts of the glacier. This can provide insights into the thermal regime and melting patterns of the glacier.",

                    "Answer": "The temperature data collected from the glacial regions in the Hengduan Mountains during the early 1980s could be influenced by factors such as the specific location and altitude of the sampling points, the drilling information, and the ice surface conditions. These were meticulously recorded during field expeditions conducted by a scientific team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In addition, environmental and climatic conditions at the time of sampling could also play a significant role in influencing these variations.",
