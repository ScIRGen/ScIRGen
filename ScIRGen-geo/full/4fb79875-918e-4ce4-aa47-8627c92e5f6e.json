            "description": "The dataset of forest canopy gap fraction above the rain gauges observed by the camera (PENTAX K100D, 2400×1600) was obtained at the super site (100m×100m, Qinghai spruce) around the Dayekou Guantan forest station from 9:00-10:40 on Jun. 4, 2008. Observation items included the ground-based LiDAR scanning, the total station measuring, DGPS, tally investigation, LAI, canopy spectrum, camera observations of the canopy, soil evapotranspiration, the soil frozen tube observations, surface roughness, precipitation interception, soil moisture and dry-wet weight of the forest component.\n     A subplot (25m×25m) was chosen for precipitation interception observations with different canopy density, and 32 sets of photos were taken 1m above the ground. Through studying those photos, the number and location of rain gauges could be determined; and then the canopy density could also be further developed.",

At the Guantan Forest Station, a digital camera (PENTAX K100D) was used to take 32 sets of photographs of the canopy in a 25m×25m hydrology experimental plot. These images were then analyzed to determine the structure of the canopy and calculate the canopy closure above rain gauges.",

This process involves capturing images at specific intervals and locations within the designated hydrology experimental site, and using the resulting data to determine the number and placement of rain gauges based on canopy density.",
