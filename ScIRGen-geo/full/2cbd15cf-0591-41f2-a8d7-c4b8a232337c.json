These sources offer detailed information about road classifications and codes, which are crucial for creating an updated and reliable dataset. Additionally, the compatibility of these sources with the existing transportation data and the need for consistent updates based on the latest available data, such as the 2009 highway traffic map from Gansu Province, could be significant factors.",
