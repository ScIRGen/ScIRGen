            "description": "The data of cultivated land in 1800 comes from tiehu Inventory, in which the data of Lazi county and Xietongmen County in the modern administrative unit are not recorded. Therefore, the missing data of these two counties should be interpolated.The farmland data in 1900 came from the annals of Lhasa and other county Chronicles.The land area recorded in the data is converted into modern mu units, and the missing counties are calculated using the area's per capita cultivated land and population.Tibetan Plateau with high altitude,cold climate,poor natural conditions and fragile ecological environment become the sensitive and promoter region of global climate change.Studying for Land reclamation of historical period in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not only the specific way to participate in the global environmental change, but also can provide the comprehensive research of land use change with abundant regional information,there is important significance  for studying history in our country even the whole world of land use/cover change research.The region of Brahmaputra River and its two tributaries in Tibetan Plateau pastoral transitional zone is one of the important typical agricultural area, and is the area with the most intense land reclamation activities and the fastest population growing.Proceeding deep historical data mining in the study area to reconstruct the cropland spatial patterns over the past 300 years has important significance to study the human land use activities under the background of  global climate change.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of historical land use research on the Tibetan Plateau, '耕地空间分布格局' refers to the spatial distribution patterns of cultivated land. This involves understanding how cultivated areas were spread across the region over time, specifically in the years 1800 and 1900, using historical documents such as '铁虎清册' and various county records to reconstruct these patterns. The research focuses on converting historical land measurements into modern units and filling in missing data for certain counties to provide a comprehensive view of land use changes within the '一江两河' agricultural area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The need for data interpolation arises due to missing data in certain modern administrative units, such as the lack of recorded data for Lazi County and Xietongmen County in the historical records of the 1800s. These gaps can be attributed to the incomplete coverage of historical documents like the '铁虎清册'. Factors affecting data accuracy include the ecological vulnerability of the Tibetan Plateau, its significant altitude variations, and harsh climate conditions, which may have influenced both the extent of historical documentation and the methods used to estimate missing data based on population and per capita land data.",

                    "Answer": "Using historical document-based data collection methods can lead to challenges in accuracy and completeness due to potential gaps and biases in historical records. For instance, the dataset for 1800 relies on '铁虎清册', which lacks data for certain counties, requiring interpolation for missing areas. Similarly, for 1900, the data comes from local chronicles such as '拉萨市志', which may have varying levels of detail and accuracy. This reliance on historical documents necessitates conversion of land area measurements to modern units and interpolation based on population and land use estimates for missing data, which could introduce uncertainties and affect the dataset's precision and reliability.",

This research contributes to the comprehensive study of land use changes and offers valuable regional information for understanding historical land use/land cover changes in China and globally.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using historical records such as 《铁虎清册》 and 《拉萨市志》 that document land area and then converting these measurements into modern units such as acres. For counties with missing data, one approach is to calculate the missing information by considering the average per capita cultivated land and the population size in those areas.",

                    "Answer": "The reconstruction of farmland spatial distribution patterns in the 'One River, Two Tributaries' region relies on historical resources such as the '铁虎清册' for the year 1800 and local chronicles like '拉萨市志' for the year 1900. These documents provide recorded land areas, which can be converted to modern units. Additionally, the methodology considers missing data by using average farmland per capita and population figures. The challenging natural conditions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, such as high altitude, cold climate, and fragile ecosystem, highlight the importance of these historical documents in understanding land use changes in this vulnerable region.",
