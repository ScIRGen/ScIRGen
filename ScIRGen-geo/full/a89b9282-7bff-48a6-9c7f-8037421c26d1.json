            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the scintillometer at Arou Superstation in the Heihe integrated observatory network. The north tower was set up with the receiver, and the south tower was equipped with transmitter. The site (north: 100.471° E, 38.057° N; south: 100.457° E, 38.038° N) was located in Caodaban village of A’rou town in Qilian county, Qinghai Province. The underlying surface between the two towers was alpine meadow. The elevation is 3033 m. The effective height of the LASs was 13.0 m, and the path length was 2390 m. \nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals for the near infrared scintillometer and 200 Hz for the optical &microwave scintillometer were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat and latent heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) raw data processing and calculating the intensity variance. (2) Calculating the structural parameters of air refractive index. (3) Calculating the meteorological structural parameters. (4) Calculating the sensible and latent heat flux。\nThe dataset contained the following variables: Date/time (yyyy/m/d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index for near infrared scintillometer (Cn2, m-2/3), intensity variance for LAS, MWS and OMS (Var_LAS, Var_MWS, Var_OMS), the sensible heat flux (H, W/m^2), and the latent heat flux (LE, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xlsx format. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

However, new techniques in the big data era have rarely been introduced into operational ecosystem monitoring, particularly for fragile ecosystems in remote areas. Ecosystem monitoring can be defined as a time series of measurements of key variables in the biosphere and is designed to detect variability in ecosystem dynamics and ultimately answer questions regarding biospheric changes. Driven by the advancement of smart devices and rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), ecosystem monitoring has entered a new paradigm: monitoring the ecosystem based on the IoT. The advancement of embedded microprocessors and wireless communication has led to the development of smart devices for field-based and in situ environmental monitoring."
