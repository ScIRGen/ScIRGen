            "description": "A total of 52 sample sites were selected in the desert belts of Qinghai and Tibet for field sampling of aboveground biomass of vegetation during the vegetation growing season in 2019 and 2020. At the same time, the longitude, latitude and altitude of the experimental site were recorded using handheld GPS devices. The field setting method of the quadrate is as follows: select a section with uniform vegetation. When the vegetation is relatively abundant, the quadrate is set as a 10 m x10 m square plot, and when the vegetation is relatively sparse, the quadrate is set as a 30 m x30 m square plot or a 30 m x90 m rectangular plot. 3-5 small sample boxes (1m x 1m) were randomly thrown into the set sample plot to determine the specific location of the sample. Collect plant samples by sample harvesting method: register plant species, number of plants of each species and other information in sample area of 1 square meter. All kinds of plants in the quadrate were planted and mowed on the ground, and the collected herbaceous plant samples were placed in archives and marked with species, sample site name and number, collection time and other information. They were brought back to the laboratory and dried to a constant weight in a constant temperature drying oven at 65 â„ƒ. The dry weight of the plant samples was measured. Finally, the aboveground biomass of the vegetation was calculated. In addition, two kinds of remote sensing net primary productivity (NPP) data of the 52 sample points were extracted by the longitude and latitude of the sampling points. (1) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 2000 to 2018, and calculated the annual Integrated Enhanced Vegetation Index (IEVI). IEVI was highly correlated with net primary productivity (NPP). Can be used as a proxy indicator of net primary productivity (He et al. 2021, Science of The Total Environment). (2) Percentage of remote sensing net primary productivity (NPP) and its quality control (QC) in 2001-2020, NPP remote sensing data from MOD17A3HGF Version 6 product (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod17a3hgfv006/), the net photosynthetic value (the total primary productivity - keep breathing) is calculated. In the sample sites with low vegetation coverage, there may be null value (NA) of remote sensing net primary productivity.",

                "Global warming has intensified and accelerated the hydrologic cycle, causing precipitation patterns shifting to higher variability and more frequent dry and wet years, which is almost ubiquitous globally. Increasing precipitation variability may profoundly affect ecosystem functioning and structure, especially primary productivity. Therefore, understanding the relationship between plant productivity and precipitation is crucial to ecosystem function and also to humans who depend upon primary productivity for food, fiber and fuel. The lags in the response of ecosystems to changes in precipitation and \"asymmetries\" in the productivity-precipitation relationship modulate the effect of precipitation variability on productivity. The legacy effect of unusually dry or wet periods on biomass could last for less than one year up to seven years, of which one year is the most commonly reported lag time. Previous-year precipitation has been found to drive the current-year ecosystem process through lagged/legacy effect in multiple sites. At the interannual scale, the lagged precipitation effect is defined as the impact of previous-year precipitation conditions on the current structure and functioning of ecosystems. Drylands comprise 45% of the terrestrial earth surface, and precipitation is the most limiting factor to the functioning of dryland ecosystems. Drylands are inherently slow in the dynamics of soil nutrient buildup and plant productivity compared to other ecosystems, we would expect strong lagged effects of past climate conditions such as precipitation on current functioning. However, our ability to forecast ecosystem responses to climate change is still hindered by our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the lagged precipitation effect."

To test our hypotheses, we divide terrestrial ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere drylands into the lagged and unlagged types."

However, our ability to forecast ecosystem responses to climate change is still hindered by our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the lagged precipitation effect.

For each pixel in the Northern Hemisphere drylands, linear regression and multiple linear models between current-year iEVI and current-year precipitation and/or previous-year precipitation were fitted. To test the first hypothesis, i.e., the lagged type had a lower sensitivity of productivity response to precipitation. We fitted the regressions between iEVI and precipitation for each pixel. To test the second hypothesis, i.e., the lagged type had higher interannual precipitation variability and more occurrences of dry and wet years. We calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of annual precipitation and the occurrences of dry and wet years for each pixel based on 19-year annual precipitation data. To test the third hypothesis, i.e., the lagged type had a higher sensitivity of other environmental factors to precipitation. We compared the difference between the two types in terms of climatic-edaphic factors, to explore what factors were responsible for the lagged precipitation effect."

The use of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) at 0.05Â° spatial resolution and monthly compositing periods can help in examining interannual variability and the lagged effects of precipitation on productivity, as seen in the interpretation of ecosystems' responses to precipitation variability.",

This can complicate efforts to accurately assess productivity and necessitates robust quality control and data validation techniques to ensure reliable estimates.

For denser vegetation, a 10m x 10m square plot is used, and for sparser vegetation, larger plots like 30m x 30m or 30m x 90m are used. Within these plots, smaller 1m x 1m quadrats are randomly placed for sampling. Plant samples are collected by cutting them at ground level, recording species and plant count, and drying them in a laboratory at 65Â°C to determine dry weight. A handheld GPS device is used to record the location, including latitude, longitude, and altitude.",

The EVI data from 2000-2018 is used to calculate the integrated EVI (iEVI), which is highly correlated with NPP and can serve as a surrogate for NPP.
