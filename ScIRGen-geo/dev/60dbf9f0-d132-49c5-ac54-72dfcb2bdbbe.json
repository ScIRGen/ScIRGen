                "Anthropogenic aerosols may play an important role in climatic change through the worldwide acceleration of glacier melting. As the dominant fractions of fine atmospheric aerosols, carbonaceous particles and sulfate have received special attention due to their strong light-absorbing and scattering properties, respectively. In cold regions, submicron black EC either trapped in snow and ice crystals or deposited directly on the surface may reduce the surface albedo and warm snow and ice by absorbing solar radiation. Recent decades have witnessed exceptional economic development and population increases in Asia, resulting in serious air pollution accompanying higher energy demands. Air pollutants and aerosol particulates from biomass burning and industrial emissions appear to be the major cause of the Asian Brown Cloud. Apart from Greenland and Antarctica, the high-elevation Tibetan Plateau is one of the largest snow and ice areas of the world. Previous studies suggest that the regional lower atmospheric warming trend associated with the thick haze has contributed to the melting of Tibetan glaciers, threatening the water supply of 60% of the world's population that live in this region."

Consequently, few data exist regarding the deposition of the Asian Brown Cloud on snow and ice, which has precluded an accurate evaluation of the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on Himalayan glacier retreat and radiative forcing."

                "During the summer of 2006, a 29 m ice core was retrieved at an elevation of 5500 m above sea level (asl) on the PLZ4 glacier using an electromechanical drill. The ice samples for measurement of carbonaceous aerosols were prepared at a temperature of -20°C in a class 100 clean room. The outer approximately 1.0 cm portion of each section was pared away with a precleaned scalpel. EC and WIOC analysis was achieved using a Desert Research Institute (DRI) Model 2001 Thermal/Optical Carbon Analyzer (Atmoslytic Inc., Calabasas, California). The second column of ice core was cut at 10 cm intervals into 289 sections and allowed to melt at room temperature. Oxygen isotope ratios were determined via the classical headspace equilibration technique using a MAT-253 isotope mass spectrometer."

                "Annual and seasonal concentrations of EC, WIOC, and inorganic ions in the ice core increased from 1998 to 2005. For carbonaceous matter, the increase was more moderate than for inorganic ions (a factor of 3 for EC and 2.2 for WIOC). Concentrations of nss-SO4 2/C0 are mainly due to fossil fuel emissions, and ionic compositions dominated by nss-SO4 2/C0,N H4 +, and NO3 /C0(over 43% of the total inorganic ion concentration) in the PLZ4 ice core all implicate combustion sources. The main source of EC is predominantly from combustion emissions, although no major pollution sources exist adjacent to the remote location of the high-elevation drill site (5500 m asl). Atmospheric pollutants emitted in South Asia can be transported year-round to the southeastern Tibetan Plateau glacier region under monsoon conditions and by the westerlies."
