            "description": "The industrial and mining land in this dataset is extracted from the independent industrial and mining land in the China Land Use/Cover Dataset (CLUD), which refers to the land of factories, mines, large-scale industrial areas, oilfields, salt farms, quarries, and their ancillary land such as transportation roads, including open pit mining types. This dataset contains data on the area, quantity and scale of industrial and mining industries, as well as regional gross domestic product (GDP), GDP in the secondary industry and GDP in the tertiary industry in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 1990 to 2020. Among them, the data on the area, count and scale of industrial and mining sites on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were obtained from the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The spatial resolution of the data was at the county administrative units and the temporal resolution was at 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. The data on regional gross domestic product, GDP in the secondary industry and GDP in the tertiary industry were obtained from the Sichuan Statistical Yearbook, Yunnan Statistical Yearbook, Tibet Statistical Yearbook, Gansu Development Yearbook, Qinghai Statistical Yearbook, Xinjiang Statistical Yearbook and other statistical yearbooks. The spatial resolution of the data was at the municipal administrative units and the temporal resolution was at 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020.",

These data are sourced from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research. In contrast, regional GDP data, including secondary and tertiary industry GDP, are sourced from various statistical yearbooks and are collected at the city level with temporal resolution for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in area, number, and scale data of industrial and mining land on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 1990 to 2020, as extracted from the China Land Use/Cover Dataset (CLUD), provide insights into the expansion or contraction of industrial activities. These trends may reflect responses to economic policies, environmental regulations, technological advancements, or resource availability.

                    "Answer": "Discrepancies in the reported areas, quantities, and scales of mining and industrial lands in the Tibetan Plateau from 1990 to 2020 can be attributed to the spatial resolution of data which is at the county level, the time resolution with data points only at specific years (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020), and varying data sources including different statistical yearbooks for regional GDP and industrial outputs.",

                    "Answer": "The objective of collecting data on industrial and mining land use in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 1990 to 2020 is to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of industrial expansion and its impact on regional development. This data provides insights into the changes in land use related to industrial activities, which can significantly influence regional economic assessments by correlating the growth of industrial land use with changes in regional GDP, as well as the production values of the secondary and tertiary industries. The data helps policymakers and researchers analyze trends and make informed decisions regarding sustainable development and resource management in the region.",
