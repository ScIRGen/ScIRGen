            "description": "The dataset of water content of forest canopy components (the twig and the leaf) measurements was obtained at the super site (100m√ó100m) around the Dayekou Guantan forest station on Jun. 5, 2008. The sample tree was selected according to different diameters at breast height. 5 diameter classes were divided and in each class, 10 trees were selected and altogether 30 trees were selected as sampling trees. Branches in different parts were picked by the tree pruner and the twig and the leaf were separated manually, whose green weight was measured by the scales on the scene and dry weight by oven drying in the lab. \n     Those provide reliable data for the reconstruction of the 3D structure of the forest scene, and for modelling active and passive remote sensing mechanisms and the simulation of remote sensing images.",
