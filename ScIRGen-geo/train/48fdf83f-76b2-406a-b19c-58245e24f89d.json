            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with the airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) mission was obtained in the Linze station foci experimental area on Jul. 8, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) soil moisture (0-5cm) measured by the cutting ring method (50cm^3) in P1 to P6 strips (17 sample points each). Photos were taken. The preprocessed soil volumetric moisture data were archived as Excel files.\n     (2) surface radiative temperature measured by three handheld infrared thermometer (5# and 6# from Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, and one from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources, which were all calibrated) from P1 to P6 strips. There are 34 sample points in total and each was repeated three times synchronizing with the airplane. Photos were taken. Data were archived as Excel files.\n     See the metadata record “WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the Linze station foci experimental area” for more information of the quadrate locations.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of remote sensing experiments, 'L&K band airborne microwave radiometer ground synchronous observation' refers to the process of collecting data using an airborne microwave radiometer operating in the L and K frequency bands, while simultaneously conducting ground-based observations. These observations include measuring parameters such as soil moisture and surface radiation temperature. The aim is to ensure that the data collected by the airborne instruments are accurately synchronized and validated with ground-based measurements to improve the reliability and accuracy of the remote sensing data.",

                    "Answer": "Using calibrated instruments for soil moisture and surface radiation temperature observations can lead to improved data accuracy. Calibration ensures that the measurements taken by the instruments are aligned with known standards, reducing systematic errors. For instance, the hand-held infrared thermometers used for surface radiation temperature observations were calibrated using blackbody standards, providing a linear fitting equation to adjust raw data. This calibration process helps in aligning the observed temperatures with true values, hence enhancing the reliability and precision of the dataset.",

This approach allows for detailed calibration and validation of airborne measurements against ground truth data. By doing so, the research aims to ensure that the airborne sensor readings are reliable and can be used to extrapolate soil and temperature data over larger areas efficiently. Such synchronization helps refine the dataset's accuracy and utility for broader remote sensing applications.",

This calibration equation is then used to adjust the raw observational data.",

For soil moisture, the use of a ring knife with a volume of 50cm^3 allows for the observation of 0-5cm surface soil moisture across multiple observation points. For surface radiation temperature, handheld infrared thermometers, which are calibrated using black body standards, provide precise temperature readings. The calibration process involves linear fitting of measured temperatures to black body temperatures, ensuring accuracy. The data is then stored in Excel for further analysis.",
