            "description": "This data set is a granitoid geological data set in hengduan Mountain area, which is located in western Sichuan, eastern Tibet and western Yunnan in the eastern part of qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The area is bounded by the Ailaoshan-Jinshajiang deep fault, the Kang-Dian ancient land of the Yangtze plate in Eurasia to the east, and the Ancient Tethis-Himalayan tectonic zone to the west. From Precambrian to Tertiary, the granitoids in hengduan Mountains are well developed from neutral, acidic to alkaline, and are distributed in bands. Due to the change of granite types caused by tectonic evolution, multiple types of granites are distributed in the same rock belt, thus forming the composite rock belt. The original data of this data set is digitized from the book \"Granite Geochemistry in Hengduan Mountains\". This data set provides basic data for the study of Hengduan Mountains and has reference value for the study of related fields.",
            "instructions": "The dataset is stored in Excel format and consists of seven workbooks, which respectively introduce the chemical composition of granites in different places in hengduan Mountains and the division of granites' formation and invasion periods.",
