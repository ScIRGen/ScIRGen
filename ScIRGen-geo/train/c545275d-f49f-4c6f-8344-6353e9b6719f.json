                "Accurate and complete data of ﬁre locations and Burned areas (BA) are important for a variety of applications including quantifying trends and patterns of ﬁre occurrence and assessing the impacts of ﬁres on a range of natural and social systems, e.g., simulating carbon emissions from biomass burning. Remotely-sensed satellite imagery has been widely used to generate burned area products. Burned area products at the global scale using satellite images have been mostly based on coarse spatial resolution data such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), VEGETATION, or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The recently released Fire_cci product was produced based on MODIS images and has the highest spatial resolution (250 m) of all the existing global BA products, and it can greatly support global climate modeling at moderate resolution thanks to its promising results. However, owing to the growing availability of satellite images of higher resolution, the requirement of BA products derived from those images is also increasing as these products can provide more detailed perimeters of BA, as well as small burned patches. For instance, imagery collected by the family of Landsat sensors is useful and appropriate for monitoring the extent of BA and provides spatial and temporal resolutions ideal for science and management applications. Landsat sensors can provide a longer temporal record (from the 1970s until now) of burned area relative to existing global BA products and potentially with increased accuracy and spatial detail in most areas on the Earth. In summary, global BA products are only available at coarse spatial resolution, while 30-m resolution burned area products are limited to speciﬁc regions. One of the difﬁculties in producing Landsat-based BA products is that the traditional approaches successfully applied to extract global BA from MODIS, VEGETATION, etc., do not work well due to the limited temporal resolution of the Landsat sensors. Moreover, the analysis of post-ﬁre reﬂectance may be easily contaminated by clouds or weakened by quick vegetation recovery, particularly in Tropical regions. However, thanks to Google Earth Engine (GEE), a new generation of cloud computing platforms with access to a huge catalog of satellite imagery and global-scale analysis capabilities, it is now possible to perform global-scale geospatial analysis efﬁciently as the pre-processing of satellite images becomes more user-friendly."

The Random Forest (RF) algorithm provided by GEE was applied to train a decision forest classiﬁer, and the global training data consisted of 6735 burned and 6146 unburned samples, which were manually collected from 120 Landsat scenes generated by stratiﬁed random sampling. For the purpose of burned area mapping, 6 bands of the Landsat-8 image were used, i.e., three visible bands (blue, 0.452–0.512 µm; green, 0.533–0.590 µm; red, 0.636–0.673 µm), Near Infrared band (NIR, 0.851–0.879 µm), and two Short Wave Infrared bands (SWIR1, 1.566–1.651µm; SWIR2, 2.107–2.294 µm)."

Validation: Commonly, when satellite data are used as reference data, they should have higher spatial resolution than the data used to generate the BA product. Consequently, in this study, some publicly-available satellite images of higher-resolution were utilized, while Landsat comprised the majority of the validation data source. Speciﬁcally, Landsat-8 (LC8) images were employed to generate reference data independently for most of the validation sites except those located in the United States (U.S.), South America, and China."
