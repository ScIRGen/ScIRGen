In the context of the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon Vapor Channel, an observational network of 18 rain gauge stations was established to collect rainfall data. The data collection dates range from November 2018 to April 2022, with a temporal resolution of hourly measurements in mm/hour. This network helps in understanding rainfall patterns and hydrological processes in the area.",
