            "description": "This dataset includes the emissivity spectrum of typical ground objects in middle researches of the Heihe river basin. This dataset was acquired in oasis, desert, Gobi and wetland of experiment area. Time range starts from 2012-05-25 to 2012-07-18 (UTC+8).\nInstrument: MODEL 102F PORTABLE FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer), Handheld infrared thermometer.\nMeasurement methods: at the first step, measure the thermal radiance of cold blackbody, warm blackbody, sample and gold plate (Downwelling Radiance). The radiance of cold blackbody and warm blackbody was used to calibrate the instrument, and eliminate the “noise” caused by the device itself. The retrieval of emissivity and temperature was then performed using iterative spectrally smooth temperature-emissivity separation (ISSTES) algorithm. The retrieved emissivity spectrum range from 8 to 14 μm, with spectral resolution of 4cm-1.                  \nDataset contains the original recorded spectra (in ASCII format) and the log files (in doc format). The processed data are emissivity curves (ASCII) that ranged from 8 to 14 μm, and the temperatures of samples.  Thermal photos of the sample, digital photo of the scene and the object are recorded in some cases.",
