            "description": "The dataset is the salinity index (SI) products of 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the SI equation which is based on the method that the red band and blue band can well reflect the soil salinity.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.SI is usually used to quantitatively evaluate the salinized soil .",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the SI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the SI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SI;the NBR is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-SI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-SI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the SI results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the SI results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
