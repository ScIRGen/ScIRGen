            "description": "The measurement data of the sun spectrophotometer can be directly used to perform inversion on the optical thickness of the non-water vapor channel, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical thickness, and moisture content of the atmospheric air column (using the measurement data at 936 nm of the water vapor channel). The aerosol optical property data set of the Tibetan Plateau by ground-based observations was obtained by adopting the Cimel 318 sun photometer, and both the Mt. Qomolangma and Namco stations were involved. The temporal coverage of the data is from 2009 to 2016, and the temporal resolution is one day. The sun photometer has eight observation channels from visible light to near infrared. The center wavelengths are 340, 380, 440, 500, 670, 870, 940 and 1120 nm. The field angle of the instrument is 1.2°, and the sun tracking accuracy is 0.1°. According to the direct solar radiation, the aerosol optical thickness of 6 bands can be obtained, and the estimated accuracy is 0.01 to 0.02. Finally, the AERONET unified inversion algorithm was used to obtain aerosol optical thickness, Angstrom index, particle size spectrum, single scattering albedo, phase function, birefringence index, asymmetry factor, etc.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is one of the most imposing topographic features on the surface of the Earth. With an immense area (about 2,500,000 km2) and mean elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level, TP plays a key role in Asia climatology and atmospheric circulation. Meanwhile, the atmosphere over the plateau is probably the least affected by human activities in the Asian continent due to the sparse population and minimal industries, providing a unique opportunity to describe atmospheric processes and changes. In this context, several model simulation and satellite observation works have been carried out over the TP to elucidate the effects of aerosol on regional climate and water cycles. Considering its huge area and essential role in the climate system, the lack of detailed knowledge of aerosol optical properties over TP leads to large uncertainties in climate modeling and assessments. AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a worldwide aerosol characterization network with the automatic CIMEL Sun/sky radiometer as the principal instrument. Due to its significant advances on observation techniques and analysis methods, AERONET has been producing reliably and continuously detailed optical properties of various types of aerosols worldwide."
