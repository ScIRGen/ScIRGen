            "description": "The data included the inputs of manure nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) for cereals, fruits, vegetables, and other crops, along with the manure proportion of total N, P, and K inputs at the county level. The national survey data of > 6.6 million farmers were collected from 2005 to 2014. the total manure N, P, and K input to the cropland for each crop type was extensively quantified at the county level. Second, based on county-level statistical data, the manure inputs for the four crop types were calculated. Finally, in combination with chemical fertilizer input data from the national survey, the county-level spatial variation of the proportion of manure input was established. Our results provide a clear perspective for manure nutrient management in agricultural production, as well as detailed support for environmental impact assessment at the spatial level in China.",
            "instructions": "A national survey of 6.6 million farmers in 2,013 counties was conducted from 2005 to 2014.Information regarding chemical N, P, and K and manure application rates was used in this study. First, the farmers were divided into four groups according to crop type: cereals, fruits, vegetables, and others; the total manure N, P, and K input to the cropland for each crop type was extensively quantified at the county level. Second, based on county-level statistical data, the manure inputs for the four crop types were calculated. Finally, in combination with chemical fertilizer input data from the national survey, the county-level spatial variation of the proportion of manure input was established.\n\nThe datasets were obtained in Excel file format with the following four sheets: “manure N”, “manure P”, “manure K”, and “manure percentage”. The first three sheets described the inputs (unit: tons) of manure N, P, and K into cropland, respectively; the last sheet provided the manure proportions of total nutrient input. These datasets contained the following fields: ProvCode, representing the provincial administrative division code; PAC2015, representing the 2015 county-level administrative division code, obtained from the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the People’s Republic of China; and “TM_Cereals”, “TM_Fruits”, “TM_Vegetables”, and “TM_Others” corresponding to the total manure N, P, and K inputs for the four crop types. In the sheet “manure percentage,” “Mprop_N”, “Mprop_P”, and “Mprop_K” were the manure nutrient proportions of total N, P, and K inputs, respectively. Blank fields indicated municipal districts and some counties without cropland.\n\nHere, we provide vector layers of China’s county-level administrative divisions, packaged in a compressed file called “ChinaCounty”; all results can be revealed by matching the shared PAC2015 field in the layers and Excel datasets.",
