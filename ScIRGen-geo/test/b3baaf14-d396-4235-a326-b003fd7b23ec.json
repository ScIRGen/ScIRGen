                "The permafrost currently accounts for about 25% of the global land area, and they mainly distribute in Canada, Russia, Mongolia, China, and Alaska in the United States. Lots of studies based on observations and simulations show that the global climate is undergoing a significant warming. Furthermore, climate-change scenarios indicated that arctic surface temperature warmed more than twice as fast as global temperature during the early twentieth century. However, frozen soil is highly sensitive to temperature and not stable, so climate warming has an effect on permafrost degradation. Accordingly, the permafrost degradation will also affect stream hydrology, ecosystems, engineering constructions, and sustainable development in the circum-Arctic region. In the context of climate change, quantifying the interannual and interdecadal variations in frozen ground on regional and circum-Arctic scales has major significance, but to a large extent, the specific and accurate quantitative methods hardly exist. Therefore, the freezing and thawing index plays essential roles in the studies of the frozen ground, they not only have widely application in permafrost to predict active layer thickness and permafrost distribution, but also are used in seasonally frozen ground regions to estimate freeze depth and classify snow depth. In addition, these indices can provide reference information for engineering construction in cold regions and assessing its vulnerability to climate change. At a large regional scale, such as the Northern Hemisphere, the annual freezing and thawing indices were usually calculated based on the mean monthly air temperature due to lack of long-term daily observed data in terms of spatial coverage and temporal homogeneity, but using this approximate calculation method caused some unavoidable errors especially when the MMAT is close to 0 °C."

(2) In order to assess the reliability of the freezing/thawing index, some weather stations are selected to verify the accuracy of the freezing/thawing index derived from daily and monthly datasets. (3) Combined with a climate-based predictive model, this study estimates the permafrost extent based on the freezing/thawing index and Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) snow depth data."

The gridded Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Time-series (TS) data version 4.01 provides 0.5° × 0.5° global land temperatures in the period from January 1901 to December 2016. However, the globally gridded climate assimilation data NCEP Reanalysis 1 can provide six-hourly air temperature from 1948 to present, but this dataset has a crude resolution with only 2.5° × 2.5°. Hence, given the possible errors of the freezing/thawing index caused by the mean monthly data and crude spatial resolution, a new dataset, CRUNCEP, is selected in this study."

More important, the change trend in the freezing/thawing index after 1988 was more significant than before. Comprehensive relative errors evaluation implied that freezing/thawing based on daily datasets was more accurate generally, although both of other datasets were available in calculating the freezing/thawing index. Finally, considering that the published permafrost map of the circum-Arctic only shows the past permafrost distribution, but it cannot reflect the permafrost distribution after 2000 under the climate warming. Hence, we simulated the current (mean from 2000 to 2015) permafrost area which is 19.96 × 10^6 km^2, and the results showed some discrepancies between published and simulated permafrost extent mainly located in isolated permafrost regions."
