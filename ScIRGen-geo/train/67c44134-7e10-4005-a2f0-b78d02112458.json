            "description": "The aim of the simultaneous observation of land surface temperature is obtaining the land surface temperature of different kinds of underlying surface, including greenhouse film, the roof, road, ditch, concrete floor and so on, while the sensor of thermal infrared go into the experimental areas of artificial oases eco-hydrology on the middle stream. All the land surface temperature data will be used for validation of the retrieved land surface temperature from thermal infrared sensor and the analysis of the scale effect of the land surface temperature, and finally serve for the validation of the plausibility checks of the surface temperature product from remote sensing.\n1. Observation time and other details\nOn 25 June, 2012, ditch and asphalt road surface temperatures were observed once every five minutes using handheld infrared thermometers recorded.\nOn 26 June, 2012, ditch and asphalt road surface temperatures were observed once every five minutes using handheld infrared thermometers while greenhouse film and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every one second using self-recording point thermometer.\nOn 29 June, 2012, concrete floor surface temperatures were observed continuously using handheld infrared thermometers during the sensor of TASI go into the region. At the same time, greenhouse film and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every one second using self-recording point thermometer.\nOn 30 June, 2012, asphalt road, ditch, bare soil, melonry and ridge of field surface temperatures were observed continuously using handheld infrared thermometers during the sensor of TASI go into the region. At the same time, greenhouse film and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every one second using self-recording point thermometer.\nOn 10 July, 2012, asphalt road, ditch, bare soil, melonry and ridge of field surface temperatures were observed once every one minute using handheld infrared thermometers during the sensor of TASI go into the region. At the same time, concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every six second using self-recording point thermometer.\nOn 26 July, 2012, asphalt road, concrete floor, bare soil and melonry surface temperatures were observed once every one minute using handheld infrared thermometers during the sensor of WiDAS go into the region. At the same time, greenhouse film and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every six second using self-recording point thermometer.\nOn 2 August, 2012, corn field and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed using handheld infrared thermometers. At the same time, greenhouse film and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every six second using self-recording point thermometer. For corn field, twelve sites were selected according to the flight strip of the WiDAS sensor, and for each site one plot surface temperatures were recorded continuously during the sensor of WiDAS go into the region.\nOn 3 August, 2012, corn field and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed using handheld infrared thermometers. At the same time, greenhouse film and concrete floor surface temperatures were observed once every six second using self-recording point thermometer. For corn field, fourteen sites were selected according to the flight strip of the WiDAS sensor, and for each site three plots surface temperatures were recorded continuously during the sensor of WiDAS go into the region.\n2. Instrument parameters and calibration\nThe field of view of the self-recording point thermometer and the handheld infrared thermometer are 10 and 1 degree, respectively. The emissivity of the latter was assumed to be 0.95. The observation heights of the self-recording point thermometer for the greenhouse film and the concrete floor were 0.5 m and 1 m, respectively. All instruments were calibrated three times (on 6 July, 5 August and 20 September, 2012) using black body during observation.\n3. Data storage\nAll the observation data were stored in excel.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
