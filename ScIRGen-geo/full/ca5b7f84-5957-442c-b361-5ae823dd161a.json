(2015). Agriculture facilitated permanent human occupation of the Tibetan Plateau after 3600 BP. SCIENCE, 347, 248-250.\nThe Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with an average altitude of more than 4000m, is the highestand largest plateau all around the world, and also is one of the most unsuitable areas for human life with long-term on the earth. The remains at the archaeological site are direct evidences left behind the ancient human activities. The original data of this data is digitized from the results of \nthe Qinghai-Tibet Plateau high-textual census and archaeological survey (Qinghai Volume and Tibet Volume of the Chinese Cultural Relics Atlas). The map was digitized mainly based on the distribution maps of the sites, and the latitude and longitude coordinates and altitude were obtained. a total of 6,950 sites, most of which are distributed in the northern part of the plateau. The age range of the site is between 7000BP and 2300BP. This data set is of reference value for the research on the process and power of human diffusion to the Tibetan Plateau in the prehistoric era and other studies related to human activities in the Tibetan Plateau and the prehistoric era.",

Early studies of the mechanisms underlying the spread of wheat and barley considered a single aspect of crop growth patterns: length of the growing season. In particular, models based on a crop’s accumulated heat requirements—growing degree days (GDD)—predict that wheat and barley are more adapted to growth in high-latitude and high-altitude Eurasia than millets. Local ecology and climate, coupled with crop phenology, thus had a marked impact on crop adoption in high-altitude environments, one that differed substantially from the lowlands."

It is necessary to clearly define past crop niches to create better models for the complex history of the occupation of the plateau.

                    "Answer": "Researchers face challenges in disentangling agricultural and pastoral influences on human behavior due to potential mismatches between archaeological evidence and existing models. Addressing these challenges requires the development of more robust models and complex narratives to better interpret the spread of crops and animals in high-altitude regions.",

                    "Answer": "Ecological factors, such as high altitude and extreme environmental conditions, can heavily constrain human activity and impact the preservation and accessibility of archaeological sites. These factors can also influence the types of artifacts and evidence available, thereby complicating data collection efforts.",

                    "Answer": "Creating models for human occupation of the plateau is challenging because there is often a mismatch between archaeological data and models for human behavior. This discrepancy can arise from the complexity of interpreting how agricultural crops and pastoral animals spread across the plateau, requiring more nuanced narratives and robust models to accurately reflect past human activities.",

                    "Answer": "Redefining past crop niches is necessary because existing models may not accurately represent the thermal conditions required for successful crop growth at high altitudes. For example, growing barley at an altitude of 4000 m above sea level may not have been feasible in an average year, indicating that past models need refinement to better understand the historical agricultural practices and settlement patterns on the plateau.",

They enable precise location data collection, including coordinates and elevation, which are crucial for understanding human settlement patterns in these areas.",

Exploring interactions between local ecological niches and human adaptation strategies would provide a deeper understanding of how these activities evolved in the past, despite the challenging environment.",
