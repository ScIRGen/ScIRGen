            "description": "This data is for the whole rock major and trace, cassiterite U-Pb dating, zircon U-Pb dating, Lu Hf isotopic analysis and whole rock SR Nd isotopic analysis of granite in Sungai Lembing tin deposit, pengheng, Malaysia. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, trace element data by ICP-MS analysis, zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data by la-mc-icp-ms analysis, cassiterite U-Pb dating by ICP-MS analysis, and whole rock SR Nd isotopic composition data by MC – ICP – MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can limit (1) the age of magmatic mineralization（ 2) The genesis and magma source of granite related to mineralization（ 3) The eastern belt of the Peninsular Malaysia is characterized by extensive tin mineralization.",

This multi-method approach allows for precise determination of major and trace elements, as well as isotopic compositions and ages, which are crucial for understanding the magmatic and metallogenic processes. Consequently, it can effectively constrain the age of magmatic mineralization, the genesis and source of granites associated with mineralization, and the metallogenic tectonic setting of widespread tin mineralization in the East Belt of the Malay Peninsula.",
