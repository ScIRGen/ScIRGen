            "description": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is the process which changes from liquid or solid to vapor returning to the atmosphere in hydrological cycles since precipitation arrives at the ground. It is usually the sum of evaporation of surface soil moisture and transpiration (T) in plants. It is the key parameter in the study of global change. At present, THE EVAPotranspiration data product of MODIS satellite is an important data source for monitoring the temporal and spatial changes of the surface, and surface evapotranspiration is an important part of water balance in the earth-gas interaction. Book which has high space-time resolution MODIS16 products as the foundation, global land evaporation in area along the whole area separated from 31 key nodes and Laos, Cambodia's railway, China and myanmar oil and gas pipeline and elegant high iron three key verification area ET cutting, estimation, get the key node area of 8 to 16 days ET products, time range is 2000-2016. Is mainly used in the areas related to all the way the surface of water and energy balance in the process of simulation and dynamic monitoring and management of regional water resources rationally, especially to the scientific allocation of water resources and realize the efficient utilization of water resources has important practical significance, to be able to have a purpose of the related research of area along the area to provide data support and reference.",
