The meteorological variables were obtained with monthly means and with high horizontal resolution of 0.47 °× 0.63 ° (latitude× longitude). The summer (June, July and August) average precipitation, 850 hPa horizontal wind field and surface temperature data of the five experiments (the control experiment with modern topography and 4 sensitivity experiments without the Mongolian Plateau, Tianshan-Pamir Plateau, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, Tibetan Plateau) are stored in NetCDF format. The data set is important for the further understanding of the topography-induced formation and evolution of Asian climate pattern.",

                "Mountains are believed to have played an important role in the evolution of modern arid climate over central Asia. The main topography of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) suppresses the regional atmospheric rainfall by both the modulation of atmospheric circulation and blocking of water vapor transport from the ocean. In modern times, central Asian climate is mainly characterized by severe aridity. A number of possible reasons behind the formation of arid climate over Asia have been explored, such as global cooling, atmospheric CO2 change, Paratethys retreat, and mountain uplift. The existence of mountains is believed to be one of the most significant factors based on climate model experiments. These experiments tell us that mountains suppress rainfall over central Asia, causing, or at least enhancing, the local aridity. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the largest terrain on earth, is typically employed to explain the inland aridification process during the late Cenozoic reconstructed by eolian deposits over central Asia and downwind regions. Some possible mechanisms by which mountains influence central Asian aridity are as follows. First, the existence of mountains results in subsidence and infrequent storm development, which occur upstream of orographically-induced stationary wave troughs. Second, the topography also reduces the moisture transport from oceans into the continental interiors. The influence of the TP on Asian climate may be produced via its thermal and/or mechanical effects. Besides the main TP topography, the effect of marginal topography, within or around the main TP, on the establishment of modern Asian climate, has recently been highlighted and is mostly attributable to mechanical effects."

                "In this study, the effect of Yunnan–Guizhou and Mongolian Plateaux (YGP and MP, respectively), two marginal topographies around the main TP, on the central Asian aridity are evaluated using general circulation model experiments. In this study, we continue to evaluate the climatic effect of the Yunnan–Guizhou and Mongolian Plateaux but the focus is turned to the arid climate over central Asia. We will examine how these two topographies remotely affect the circulation structure and precipitation amount over this region."

                "In TP0, the height of the topography within the TP region and most of the Asian continent (55°–140°E, 0°–60°N) is reduced to 400 m as a flat landform. For each experiment, a total of 50 years is integrated and the last 15 years are averaged and analyzed. The simulated climatological-mean precipitation over arid central Asia, including the spatial pattern and seasonality, is first compared to observational data to examine the model performance. To understand the reasons for intensification of central Asian aridity due to topographies, a moisture budget analysis employed in Baldwin and Vecchi (2016) is conducted in this study, aiming to examine the relative contributions of climatological mean versus transient changes, and changes in horizontal winds versus humidity."

                "The results show that the precipitation over central Asia is significantly decreased by these two topographies. Compared to the whole TP-induced annual precipitation decrease of 0.45 mm/d, the contributions of the YGP and MP reach 0.14 mm/d and 0.08 mm/d, respectively. These two marginal mountains occupy approximately one half of the total change by the TP although they are much smaller in heights and sizes. A moisture budget analysis shows that all the mountains examined drive increases in subsidence and resulting decreases in humidity over central Asia, with smaller or opposing roles for changes in horizontal winds. These subsidence changes dominate the drying of Central Asia due to the TP and MP, and are largely driven by the influences of the topography on stationary waves. In contrast, the YGP dries Central Asia primarily through altering transient eddies. This implies that the effect of small-scale mountains on arid climate over central Asia might be underestimated and a considerable proportion of mechanical effect of the TP on the Asian aridity actually comes from its margins."
