            "description": "The data are the radioisotope data of Baoji granite, the major and trace geochemical data of whole rock and the major geochemical data of minerals. The samples are collected from Baoji granite body in Baoji area of Qinling orogenic belt, including biotite syenite, coarse-grained, porphyritic and fine-grained syenite, alkali feldspar granite and magnesian monzodiorite. The radiou-pb geochronology data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the Hf isotope and whole rock SR Nd isotope of radiozircon were obtained by multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the major and trace geochemical data of whole rock were obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major geochemical data of biotite and amphibole are obtained by electron microprobe analysis. The data obtained show that the syn collisional A-type granites were controlled by the Middle Triassic early Jurassic oblique continental collision, which means that the A-type granites can also be formed in the syn collisional environment.",
