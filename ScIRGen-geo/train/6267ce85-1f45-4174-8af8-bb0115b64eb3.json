It is of great significance to study the elemental composition and geochemical characteristics of granites, which is of great significance for exploring the genetic evolution, material origin and mineralization of granites. The data set includes the composition, distribution and content data of many major elements and trace elements, as well as the changes in the chemical composition of granites in different ages. The 21 trace elements in the granites in this study area were quantitatively analyzed by flameless atomic absorption method, polarography, spectrophotometric method, spectroscopic quantitative method, atomic absorption method and other methods. This dataset has in-depth research on the types, average signals and average contents of granite-like elements, which can be used as a good reference.",
