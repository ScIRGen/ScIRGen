In particular, it has been shown that measurement biases can explain discrepancies between observed and simulated Rs decadal variability. The metadata of Rs observations, including instruments, measurement methods, instrument calibrations, and changes in stations, are essential information to examine the homogeneity of the observed Rs."

Monthly Rs from historical runs of 48 CMIP5 ESMs were downloaded for this research.
