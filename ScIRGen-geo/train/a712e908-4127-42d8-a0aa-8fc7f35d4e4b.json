            "description": "This dataset includes radiocarbon data and results of archaeobotanical analyses from seven ancient cities and one large settlement. We employed paleoclimate records, historical documents, radiocarbon dating, and archaeobotanical analyses from seven ancient cities and one large settlement. The results demonstrated a shift from mixed-crop farming to the cultivation of (mainly) barley and wheat during the Wei, Jin Northern and Southern dynasties, Song-Yuan and early Ming period, with the latter crop increasingly predominant. Technological innovations and increased labour power brought about by external population migration resulting from geopolitical changes in northern China were likely responsible for the shift in crop cultivation in the HRB, rather than climate change.This study provides important archaeobotanical evidence for the agricultural development of the HRB over the historical period and highlights multiple factors that seem to have influenced the evolution of agriculture in the region.",

These migrations brought technological innovations and increased labor, possibly driving the shift in crop cultivation, rather than climate change. Data collection methods such as comprehensive analysis of climate records, historical documents, radiocarbon dating, and archaeobotanical data can capture these influences.",
