            "description": "This database is based on the theory of emergy analysis for 17 typical countries along the “Belt and Road” during 2008-2014. These countries are include Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia, Russia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Thailand, Myanmar, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Azerbaijan. The basic data sources of this database mainly include detailed information, goods and services on environmental resource flows, natural capital stocks and human production activities. The data in database is calculated and evaluated based on the solar emergy. The database consists of three tables, which are the emergy analysis table of main resource flow, comprehensive emergy analysis table of the main resource category and the system emergy indicators analysis table. The emergy transformities used in this database is updated and calculated according to the emergy baseline (12.0E+24seJ/y) given by Pro. Brown in 2016. Based on the basic data in the database, it can effectively calculate the emergy-based sustainability index system, and give the reasons for the analysis results, the solution and future planning direction for the study country. It is of great significance to the development of the national ecological economic system and provide a scientific basis for the government to improve the sustainable development status of the national ecological economic system.",

This involves calculating and assessing detailed information on resources, goods, and services and updating emergy conversion rates based on the GEB2016. The emergy accounting allows for the calculation of emergy-based indices, such as the Emergy-based Sustainability Index (ESI), and provides scientifically grounded analysis results, solutions, and future planning directions, which are significant for the development of national ecological economic systems and for government decision-making regarding sustainable development strategies.",

Emergy theory allows for the integration of diverse ecological and economic resources by converting them into a common unit, solar energy, which facilitates a unified analysis of sustainability indices and provides insights for sustainable development policies. Additionally, the emergy-based approach helps in identifying the causes of ecological economic trends and offers solutions for enhancing the sustainability of national ecological economic systems.",

                    "Answer": "Using emergy analysis as a data collection method can lead to a comprehensive understanding of ecological-economic systems by converting various ecological and economic resources into solar energy equivalents. This approach allows for effective calculation of emergy-based sustainability indices, which can provide insights into the sustainability of these systems. The results can highlight the reasons behind current ecological-economic challenges, suggest solutions, and guide future planning. Additionally, these insights are significant for enhancing national ecological-economic system development and can provide a scientific basis for government decisions on sustainable development.",

This analysis should be based on emergy theory, using updated emergy conversion rates as per GEB2016. The data should be organized into three tables: a main resource emergy analysis table, a comprehensive emergy flow analysis table for main resource categories, and a system emergy index analysis table.
