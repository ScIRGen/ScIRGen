            "description": "This dataset includes the urban land quantity of 280 cities in China under different shared Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from 2020 to 2070. The quantity of urban land represents the future urban area, expressed in square kilometers. The production process of this dataset mainly includes: (1) Establishing a simulation prediction indicator set based on historical datasets such as urban land, GDP, population, and urbanization rate. (2) Using lasso regression, regression tree, and correlation matrix, select feature indicators for training historical models. (3) Use hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering methods to cluster historical feature indicators, and use decision trees to train historical models. (4) Using Monte Carlo method and iterative approach, simulate the future urban land quantity over a period of ten years. This dataset is expected to be widely applied in China's future Socioeconomic development and climate change research. The specific production method and process of this dataset can be referred to in the paper Hou, Y., Li, Y., Li, J., Huang, Q., Duan, X., Feng, X., & Zhu, G.
