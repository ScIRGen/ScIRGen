            "description": "This dataset includes component temperatures measured by the thermal imager at the Mixed Forest and Sidaoqiao stations between 23 July and 18 August, 2014. The Mixed Forest (101.1335 °E, 41.9903 °N, 874 m.a.s.l.) and Sidaoqiao (101.1374 °E, 42.0012 °N, 873 m.a.s.l.) stations were located in the downstream of the Heihe River basin, Dalaihubu Town, Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia.\nAt the Mixed Forest station, a Testo 890-2 thermal imager (Testo Inc., Germany) with a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels was employed to acquire brightness temperature images. The imager was manually operated from a 10-m height platform of the tower between 10:00-16:00 (China Standard Time, CST) with an observation interval of 1-h on cloudless days. On August 4th observations were acquired between 11:00 and 17:00 at an interval of 10-min to match observations acquired with an airborne TIR imager. The ground based imager was pointed to five viewing directions (southeast-SE, east-E, northeast-NE, northwest-NW, and southwest-SW) and was inclined 25°–45° below the horizon depending on viewing direction. At Sidaoqiao station, a Testo 875-2i imager (Testo Inc., Germany) with a resolution of 160 × 120 pixels was manually operated from a 10-m high platform to acquire brightness temperature images in directions SW, SE, NE, and NW. Depending on the targets in each viewing direction, the imager was inclined to 30°–45° below the horizon. Observations at Sidaoqiao and Mixed Forest stations were almost synchronous. Furthermore, visible images were taken simultaneously with the aforementioned two TIR imagers (2048 × 1536 pixels for Testo 890-2 and 640 × 480 pixels for Testo 875-2i).",

                    "Answer": "The use of Testo890-2, which provides higher resolution thermal infrared images (640 × 480) and visible light images (2048 × 1536), likely offers more detailed and precise surface temperature datasets compared to Testo875-2i, which provides lower resolution thermal infrared images (160 × 120) and visible light images (640 × 480). This difference in resolution may impact the granularity of temperature data captured and the ability to detect fine-scale temperature variations on the ground, particularly in capturing component temperatures around flux towers in varied directions at specified times.",

                    "Answer": "The use of thermal imaging in mixed forest environments, as described, involves capturing surface brightness temperature and visible light images using cameras at a fixed height of 10m around flux towers. The effectiveness of this method can be inferred from the ability to capture detailed spatial temperature variations in different directions and its alignment with satellite overpass times, which allows for correlation with satellite data. The specific setup and timing, tailored to clear sky conditions, suggest a strategic approach to mitigate atmospheric interferences and enhance data accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "In capturing surface temperatures using thermal imaging in heterogeneous environments such as mixed forests, two types of thermal imagers, Testo890-2 and Testo875-2i, are employed. These instruments capture thermal infrared and visible light images from a height of 10m centered around a flux tower. Observations are conducted in multiple directions (northeast, east, southeast, southwest, and northwest) at specific times (between 10:00 to 16:00 on clear-sky days, at the top of the hour, and during MODIS and Landsat 8 overpasses). On specific occasions, such as August 4, observations are synchronized with aerial flights with an interval of about 10 minutes.",
