            "description": "This dataset is the growing season NDVI and vegetation phenology dataset of the Tibetan Plateau during during the past 20 years (2001-2020). The data source is MODIS (MOD13A2, Collection 6) products, and the spatial resolution is 1km. The dataset includes: the average NDVI during the growing season (May-September), the start date of the growing season (SOS), the end date of the growing season (EOS) and the duration of the growing season (DOS) for each year from 2001 to 2020. Two methods were used to extract vegetation phenology: dynamic threshold approach and double logistic function method. The data format is TIFF and the projection is Sphere_ ARC_ INFO_ Lambert_ Azimuthal_ Equal_ Area.",
            "instructions": "The data is stored in TIFF format and can be directly opened in ArcGIS. Two methods are used to extract phenology: dynamic threshold method and double logarithmic function method. For detailed extraction methods and formulas, please refer to readme.docx.",

                    "Answer": "The changes in NDVI and phenology data over the period from 2001 to 2020 indicate variations in vegetation growth patterns on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which can be inferred by analyzing the annual average NDVI during the growing season, the start and end dates of the growing season, and the length of the growing season. These variations may reflect responses to climatic factors or ecological changes impacting plant growth and development.",
