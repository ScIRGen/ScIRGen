            "description": "Hoh Xil, located in the hinterland of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, has long been regarded as a forbidden area for human survival, so geological data are very scarce. Although the geological survey and mineral resources survey started since 1950s and the small-scale (1:2 million) geological mapping carried out at the end of 1960s have ended the history of \"blank\" in geological survey in this area, the above-mentioned data can not meet the needs of comprehensive research in the development of modern geological science, especially the data on magmatic activity and magmatism in this area is rare.\nIn 1990, a series of field geological observations were carried out by the geological group of Kekexili comprehensive scientific investigation team. More than 200 specimens were collected in the field survey. A large number of mineralogical and petrochemical data have been obtained in the laboratory.\nThis data set mainly records the chemical composition of various minerals in some areas of Hoh Xil, as well as the contents of trace and rare earth elements in some minerals.\nData source: comprehensive scientific investigation team of Hoh Xil region.\nIt provides a large number of reliable basic data for the study of Petrochemistry in this area, and is of great significance to the study of tectonic evolution history in this area.\nThe study of Mineral chemical composition is an indispensable part of mineralogy. This data set provides basic data for mineralogy.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format, including 15 workbooks and a map of intrusive, volcanic and ophiolite distribution. The table shows the chemical composition of various minerals in some areas of Hoh Xil, including the petrochemical data of some volcanic lava. In the table, the chemical composition of various minerals in the area is recorded in detail.",

During such surveys, over 200 specimens of various types were collected. In the lab, these samples undergo detailed analysis to obtain mineralogical and rock chemical data, including the chemical composition of minerals and the content of trace and rare earth elements. The data collection is facilitated by a comprehensive scientific expedition team specialized in geology, providing foundational data for studying mineral chemistry and tectonic evolution.",
