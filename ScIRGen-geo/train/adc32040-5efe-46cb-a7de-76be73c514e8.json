            "description": "This data set contains the vortex correlator observation data of zhangye wetland station in the middle reaches of heihe meteorological observation network from January 15, 2014 to December 31, 2014.The site is located in zhangye city, gansu province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 100.44640E, 38.97514N, and the altitude is 1460.00m.The height of the vortex correlation instrument is 5.2m, the sampling frequency is 10Hz, the ultrasonic direction is due to the north, and the distance between the ultrasonic wind speed and temperature instrument (Gill) and the CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500A) is 25cm.\nThe original observation data of vorticity correlativity is 10Hz, and the released data is the data of 30 minutes processed by Eddypro software. The main steps of its processing include: outfield value elimination, delay time correction, Angle correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output by Eddypro software was also screened.(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation were excluded;(3) the missing rate of 10Hz original data is more than 10% every 30min;(4) the observed data of weak turbulence at night were excluded (u* less than 0.1m/s).The average period of observation data was 30 minutes, 48 data a day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.Suspicious data caused by instrument drift and other reasons are marked in red. Among them, the memory card error occurred from January 1, 2014 to January 15, 2014, during which the data is missing.\nObservations published include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (℃), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), stability Z/L (dimensionless), sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE,Carbon dioxide flux mass identification QA_Fc.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest are 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Li et al.(2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al.(2011) for observation data processing.",

                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance method in the context of hydrometeorological observations refers to a technique used to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within the atmosphere. It involves the use of instruments like an ultrasonic anemometer and a CO2/H2O analyzer to capture high-frequency data, typically at 10Hz, which is then processed into 30-minute average flux data. This method includes steps such as outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, virtual temperature correction, and density corrections to ensure accurate measurements of variables like heat, water vapor, and CO2 fluxes.",

                    "Answer": "Data quality issues can arise due to instrument errors, such as storage card failures, as well as external factors like precipitation, which necessitates the exclusion of data collected within one hour before and after rainfall. Additionally, a high percentage of missing data in the raw 10Hz observations, particularly if more than 10% is missing within a 30-minute interval, can also lead to data quality concerns. Weak turbulence during nighttime, indicated by a friction velocity (u*) less than 0.1m/s, further causes issues in the accuracy of the data collected.",

                    "Answer": "Using Eddypro software to process raw data into 30-minute intervals results in a systematic approach to data accuracy and quality assurance. Key steps like despiking, time delay correction, angle correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, virtual temperature correction, and density corrections are employed. Quality is further ensured by assessing atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity. However, challenges remain, such as data loss due to instrument errors, precipitation influence, high data loss rates, and weak turbulence conditions. These implications highlight the balance between processing rigor and the inherent limitations of the data collection method.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of utilizing eddy covariance techniques for the collection of hydrometeorological data in wetland environments is to accurately measure and analyze the exchange of gases, such as CO2 and H2O, and energy fluxes between the wetland surface and the atmosphere. The method provides high-frequency data critical for understanding ecosystem dynamics, evaluating atmospheric stability, and assessing turbulent exchange processes and flux quality. This understanding aids in investigating the impacts of wetland ecosystems on regional climate and carbon cycles.",

These steps include outlier removal, time lag correction, angle correction, coordinate rotation (second coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, sonic temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. Quality evaluation of flux values is conducted, mainly examining atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Further data screening involves removing faulty instrument data, excluding data around precipitation events, discarding data with more than 10% missing in 30-minute intervals, and removing nighttime weak turbulence observations (u* less than 0.1 m/s).",

Additionally, data quality is assessed through atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC) tests, with further data selection criteria applied, such as discarding erroneous instrument data, data around precipitation events, data with more than 10% gaps in the original 10Hz data, and nighttime weak turbulence data (u* less than 0.1 m/s).",
