            "description": "The central and western Tibetan Plateau (CWTP) is characterized by significant changes in climate and water cycle, but in-situ precipitation data is very scarce. In past six years, we have established north-south and east-west rain gauge observation transections in the CWTP, to obtain hourly rainfall data during the warm season (May-September) from 2017 to 2020. The south-north transection extends from Yadong valley on the southern slope of the Himalayas to Shuanghu county in the hinterland of the plateau, with a total of 31 stations. The west-east transection extends from Shiquanhe in the western Tibetan Plateau to Naqu in the central part, with a total of 22 stations. The observation data were collected by the Hobo tipping bucket rain gauge that has a precision of 0.2 mm. The quality control was performed mainly for three situations: equipment hardware failure (such as jammed tipping bucket, human damage to equipment, blocked funnel holes etc.), maintenance collection induced error, and tilting of the rain gauge due to strong wind. The missing or abnormal values are represented by -999.\nThe data quality is described by the effective data percentage (effective observation of the station/total observation of the station). The effective data percentage reaches over 99% at 35 stations, between 80% and 99% at 16 stations and less than 80% at only two stations. The gauge data have been applied to characterize the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation in the CWTP, to evaluate the performance of grided precipitation products, to support the development of models and simulation applications, and to reveal the mechanisms of land-atmosphere interactions.",
            "instructions": "File naming: rainfall data is stored in xlsx format, and the name of the file is \"EW/SN+ two digits+ Z+ four digits+ yyyymmdd.xls\", in which EW represents the east-west section, SN represents the north-south section, two digits represent the station serial number, Z represents the elevation, four digits represent the specific elevation of the station, yyyymmdd represents the year, month and day when the station started operation. For example, EW01_Z4199_20170625 represents the hourly rainfall data of the first station in the east-west transection, with elevation being 4199 m above sea level and data available from June 25, 2017 to September 30, 2020. The location information of each station is provided in the table file CWTP station.xlsx, including the station name, latitude and longitude, elevation, observation start time and valid data percentage.\nData reading method: The file in this dataset can be opened directly with Excel. The first to fourth columns of the data indicate the recording time (year, month, day, hour, all recorded in UTC+8), and the fifth column is the hourly accumulated rainfall (mm) (for example, 01 data is the accumulated rainfall from 00:00-01:00).",

                "Satellite precipitation products can provide alternative data in remote areas with sparse surface observations, but the performance of these products must be evaluated before hydrometeorological applications. The western Tibetan Plateau (WTP) covers an area of nearly 1,500,000 kmÂ², where China Meteorological Administration stations are very sparse due to the harsh natural environment. Precipitation plays a key role in regulating the hydrological cycle and energy balance in the climate system. Accurate precipitation data are crucial for water resource management, weather forecasting, hydrological forecasting, and disaster warning systems. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), with an average altitude above 4000 m, is the birthplace of tens of important rivers and is referred to as the Water Tower of Asia. The western TP (WTP) covers an area of nearly 1,500,000 kmÂ² and contains the most continental glaciers and > 80% of lakes on the TP. Over the past few decades, the increasing precipitation has been proposed as the main reason for the suppressed glacier retreat and rapid expansion of lakes on the WTP.",
                "Rain gauge observations still suffer from instrumental measurement errors. If there are not adequately shielded, ground-based rain gauges can underestimate precipitation caused by the instrument wetting, evaporation, and wind-driven under-catch. Furthermore, rain gauge observations also suffer from spatial representativeness issue, particularly in the windy mountain areas. Due to the complex interaction between large-scale atmospheric circulation and topography, mountain precipitation has highly spatial and temporal variability. Satellite remote sensing is the only means facilitating precipitation observation on a global scale, providing an alternative way to monitor precipitation in remote areas. Since the first meteorological satellite, TIROS-1, was launched in April 1960, an increasing number of satellite sensors have been used to estimate precipitation. The launch of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite in 1997 was a landmark event, which carried the world's first precipitation radar (PR), improving the accuracy of precipitation estimates. The successor program of the TRMM was the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) project, which is a global satellite precipitation program cohosted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Compared to the TRMM, the GPM Core Observatory carries a microwave imager and the first dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR), which are expected to capture light rain and snowfall more accurately. A few evaluation studies have suggested that the precipitation products of the GPM-Era outperform the TRMM products on multi-time scale. Several satellite precipitation products have been produced and applied in hydrometeorological research, such as Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), Climate Prediction Center morphing (CMORPH) technique, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), and Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for the GPM (IMERG). Since satellite precipitation products are indirect estimations of precipitation, their performance must be evaluated before hydrometeorological applications. On the TP, several studies have evaluated the performance of satellite precipitation products from the perspective of hydrological simulations and spatial and temporal variability characteristics. Most of these products were evaluated against monthly-scale precipitation observations obtained from CMA meteorological stations, which are mostly located on the eastern TP (ETP).",
                "The western Tibetan Plateau (WTP) covers an area of nearly 1,500,000 kmÂ², where CMA stations are very sparse due to the harsh natural environment. To better understand the precipitation characteristics and hydrometeorological processes on the WTP, the authors established 29 rain gauges in June 2017. The GPCC and CPC gauge analyses were used to calibrate the IMERG and GSMaP satellite-only products, respectively. While the GPCC gauge analysis was corrected for under-catch by monthly maps of climatological adjustment ratios calculated by Legates and Willmott (1990), the CPC gauge analysis was not corrected for anything."

Since satellite precipitation products are indirect estimations of precipitation, their performance must be evaluated before hydrometeorological applications. However, the performance of satellite precipitation products on the WTP, especially their ability to reproduce the diurnal characteristics of precipitation, remains unknown due to a lack of observations. The very high altitude, complex topography, and severe climate have resulted on the WTP being poorly accessible and sparsely populated. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain long-term meteorological observations in this region. Rain gauges may be subject to systematic biases due to wetting, evaporation, and wind-driven under-catch.",

Water vapor transport from the Asian monsoon and mid-latitude westerlies brings a large amount of precipitation to the TP, thus hosting numerous glaciers and lakes here and providing abundant water resources to the surrounding areas. Over the past 50 years, the TP has been warming continuously; since the middle and late 1990s, the TP, except its southern part, has undergone a significant moistening. These climate changes have led to considerable changes in the TP environment, such as accelerated melting of glaciers, degradation of permafrost, obvious snow cover reduction, and rapid lake expansion.
