            "description": "Field surveys and soil sample collection were carried out in river and lake source of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and a total of 150 soil samples were collected, from August to September 2020. The data set includes serial number, plot number, latitude and longitude, altitude, soil moisture content, bulk density, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, pH and mechanical composition (sand, silt and clay content). The data format is an Excel table . The determination of various soil properties refers to the requirements of the \"Technical Specifications for Soil Environmental Quality Monitoring\" and is obtained through field sampling and indoor testing. Soil bulk density was measured in 5–10 cm and 15–20 cm soil layers, respectively. The mechanical composition is divided into sand (2–0.02 mm), silt (0.02–0.002 mm) and clay (< 0.002 mm) according to the International System of Classification. The soil is removed from impurities such as gravel and roots and crushed. The determination of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total potassium is a complete sample. The pH was determined by potentiometric method, and the water-soil ratio was 2.5:1. The collection of soil samples refers to the soil sample collection specifications, and the indoor analysis and testing refers to standard analysis methods. The data quality is controlled by measuring duplicate samples and standard samples. This data can provide data supporting for comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of typical land use changes.",

In the context of diverse geographical regions such as the river and lake source areas in Tibet, these standards allow for comparability across different sampling sites. The use of standards like those in the 《土壤环境质量监测技术规范》 ensures that the measurements of soil properties such as organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, and pH are reliable and can support assessments of environmental effects due to land use changes. However, challenges may arise due to regional variations in soil composition and environmental conditions, which might require additional calibration or adaptation of methods to maintain accuracy and relevance of the data.",

Soil samples are collected following the Soil Sample Collection Standard. The analysis includes removing impurities like gravel and roots and crushing the samples. Soil properties such as bulk density, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, and pH are measured. Bulk density is measured at 5–10 cm and 15–20 cm soil layers. Mechanical composition is classified into sand, silt, and clay based on international classification standards. pH is determined using the potentiometric method with a water-soil ratio of 2.5:1. Quality control is ensured through the determination of replicate and standard samples, based on the Technical Specifications for Soil Environmental Quality Monitoring.",

The tools and methods include using GPS for location tracking, measuring soil bulk density at specified depths (5-10 cm and 15-20 cm), and determining mechanical composition based on international classification standards. Laboratory analyses are performed for organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content, and pH is measured using the potentiometric method with a water-soil ratio of 2.5:1. Data quality is controlled through the use of repeated and standard samples.",
