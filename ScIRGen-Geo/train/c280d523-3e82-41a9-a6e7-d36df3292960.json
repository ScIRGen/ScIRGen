      "description": "The dataset is the slope adaptive waveform index product of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), abbreviated as GEDI-SAWA, aimed at reducing the impact of terrain slope on the evaluation of forest vertical structure and aboveground carbon storage using a 25 m GEDI large spot laser waveform. The dataset spans from April 18, 2019 to March 16, 2023, with a total storage capacity of 51.0 TB and a total of 73473 tracks of data. The data is organized based on the date of acquisition (in days). The file is stored in hdf5 format and named in the same way as the official products released by GEDI. For example, the GEDI-SAWA file with the file name \"GEDI02-C1_sawa_2019108002012-O01959_1-T03909_202-003_1-V002.h5\" corresponds to the GEDI L1B file with the file name \"GEDI01-B_2019108002012-O01959_1-T03909_2-003_1-V002.h5\". The field name \"RHT\" in GEDI-SAWA refers to the slope adaptive waveform index at different energy percentiles. Each spot records 24 SAWA indices at different energy heights, corresponding to the 5th, 10th, 15th,..., 85th, 90th, 95th, 96th, 97th, 98th, 99th, and 100th energy percentiles. It is worth noting that the RHT field in the SAWA file is in centimeters (cm) and stored in integer format. To convert to a universal unit of meters (m), it needs to be multiplied by a conversion coefficient (0.01).",

        "Waveform broadening effects of large-footprint lidar caused by terrain slopes are still a great challenge limiting the estimation accuracy of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) over mountainous areas. The role of remote sensing in the accounting of global carbon budgets has been widely recognized, and several regional remotely sensed estimations/maps have been released. The limited capability of either the multispectral reflectance or the radar backscattering coefficients on the quantifying of carbon storage has been widely demonstrated due to the lack of physical basis and is always restricted by the sensitivity saturations and terrain effects. The forest carbon storage in vegetation is directly determined by forest spatial structures depicted by tree sizes, stem densities, and forest types. Spaceborne large-footprint lidar plays an important role in the existing global maps as well as the near-future remote sensing schemes of forest carbon storages. However, the biggest challenge limiting the estimation accuracy of forest AGB over mountainous areas is the waveform broadening effect caused by terrain slopes, i.e., the canopy and ground returns tend to be stretched and mixed up over steep topographies."

Forests are important components of terrestrial ecosystems, containing approximately 80% of aboveground carbon (Dixon et al., 1994). Accurate mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for research on the global carbon cycle (Brown et al., 1996).",
        "Methods for measuring forest AGB, such as field measurements, are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Remote sensing methods are feasible for measuring forest AGB at regional and global scales. Multispectral remote sensing and radio detection and ranging (radar) techniques are widely used to estimate AGB. However, signal saturation problems occur when AGB reaches a certain level. The sensitivity of multispectral reflectance or radar backscattering coefficients to forest AGB is combined with uncertainties caused by the diversity of the forest's spatial structure. Lidar can overcome the saturation problem and improve the accuracy of AGB estimation because of its direct detection of the vertical forest structure. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) was designed to acquire large footprint lidar waveforms with global coverage. Many studies have demonstrated that GLAS data can be used to measure forest canopy height and AGB. However, most previous studies focused on relatively flat terrain conditions. The terrain effect is a major challenge for measuring forest heights and AGB. Many studies have been carried out to reduce the impact of terrain on the retrieval of forest structure using large footprint lidar waveforms.",

The main forest types include tropical seasonal rainforest and tropical mountain rainforest. The annual precipitation ranges from 1100mm to 2400mm. The GLAS stopped operating in 2009, but it is difficult to obtain better field measurements over the GLAS footprints. The ZELIG model has been well parameterized in the Howland forest in Maine, USA. The outputs of the ZELIG model were recorded at a 5-year interval from 5 years to 200 years for each succession sequence (i.e., 40 forest ages). The terrain slopes have two effects on the waveforms of forest stands. First, the width of the ground return is broadened, and the peak of the ground return decreases and is mixed with that of the forest canopy due to the stretching effect of the terrain slope. The second effect is that the relative vertical positions of trees also change as the slope increases.",

The influence of terrain slope on the estimation of forest AGB using the canopy height metrics extracted by the PIPE method was weak or nearly negligible. Over the full range of terrain slopes of 0°–40°, the PIPE method gave the best estimation of forest AGB, with R2=0.92 and RMSE=15.95Mg/ha for a footprint size of 70m. The estimations of forest AGB using GLAS data and field measurements confirm the conclusions from the simulated lidar waveforms. The PIPE method gave the best estimation of forest AGB, with R2=0.84 and RMSE=34.99Mg/ha. The results of this study showed that the proposed method has great potential for the estimation of forest AGB using lidar waveforms while considering terrain."
