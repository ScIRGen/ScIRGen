            "description": "The global rare metal granitic pegmatites are mainly concentrated in the major period of continental amalgamation and disintegration. This data statistics the typical niobium tantalum zirconium hafnium deposits in China. Using niobium iron ore or related cassiterite and monazite instead of zircon in these deposits as U-Pb dating minerals, 45 metallogenic age data statistics are obtained. The first metallogenic period is Proterozoic. The niobium mineralization associated with Bayan Obo and rare earth occurred in Mesoproterozoic (1.4 ~ 1.3 Ga). The niobium tantalum mineralization found in Yuanbaoshan in northern Guangxi and Fanjingshan in eastern Guizhou was formed in the late Neoproterozoic (about 820 Ma), which is the earliest niobium tantalum mineralization in South China; There are few Paleozoic Nb-Ta deposits, but their scale is large. The Paleozoic rare metal pegmatites (about 400 ~ 380 Ma) in South China represented by Nanping, Fujian Province represent the products of Caledonian intracontinental tectonic movement; The early Mesozoic Triassic mineralization related to the paleoTethys tectonic movement and the post-collision of the Central Asian orogenic belt is widely distributed (about 250 ~ 200 Ma), and directly reflects the diagenesis and mineralization of a large number of granite pegmatites in China; The late Mesozoic niobium tantalum mineralization represents the most important large-scale niobium tantalum mineralization period in China, which is concentrated from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous (about 160 ~ 120 Ma, up to 90 Ma at the latest). It is the main component of the \"Yanshanian ore-forming explosion\" in South China; The Cenozoic (mainly Oligocene to Miocene) large-scale leucogranite magmatism occurred high-resolution crystallization, resulting in the mineralization of rare metals such as niobium and tantalum. With the deepening of research, the niobium and tantalum resources in this period will become more and more significant in China. It is very significant that nearly half of China's tantalum resources are formed in Triassic (mainly granite pegmatites), while nearly 60% of niobium resources are the product of crystallization and differentiation of Late Mesozoic (Jurassic Cretaceous) granite except Bayan Obo.",

                "Niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), zirconium (Zr), and hafnium (Hf) are important critical metals. Niobium and tantalum, as well as zirconium and hafnium, have similar geochemical properties. Niobium, tantalum, zirconium, and hafnium possess material characteristics such as high-temperature resistance, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance, making them significant in industries such as defense, aerospace, nuclear industry, and superhard materials. They are considered critical metals. Niobium, tantalum, zirconium, and hafnium are all classified as high-field strength elements, with niobium and tantalum, as well as zirconium and hafnium, exhibiting similar crystal chemical properties. The ionic radii of Nb5+, Ta5+, Zr4+, and Hf4+ in six-coordinate positions are 0.64, 0.64, 0.72, and 0.71 Å, respectively. Niobium and tantalum, as well as zirconium and hafnium, are also regarded as geochemical element pairs, which means they always substitute for each other in minerals. Niobium-tantalum minerals are generally niobium-tantalum series minerals, with common niobium-tantalum minerals including niobium iron minerals and heavy tantalum iron series, burnstone-fine stone series, and tin-manganese tantalum series. Rutile and cassiterite can also be very rich in niobium and tantalum. Zirconium-hafnium minerals are primarily composed of zircon minerals but always contain varying degrees of hafnium. The most well-known is zircon, where hafnium is enriched in zircon in a solid solution form, leading to hafnium ore. Carbonatites are the major contributors to global niobium resources."
