The first column: core depth, the second column: core age frame (CAL yr BP), and the third column: carbonate oxygen isotope data. The core of Xingyun Lake is 745cm long and 14ka old. There are 149 carbonate oxygen isotope data. The summer precipitation records in Xingyun Lake since the past 14 Ka have been reconstructed by using carbonate oxygen isotopes in the sediments of Xingyun Lake. The reconstruction results show that the summer precipitation of mingmingyun Lake Basin in early Holocene is high; Since the middle Holocene, summer precipitation has gradually decreased, which is mainly controlled by summer solar radiation.",

                "Proxy-based reconstructions of Holocene temperature show that both the timing and magnitude of the thermal maximum varied substantially across different regions. As a major component of the global monsoon system, the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) transports moisture and heat from the tropical oceans to higher latitudes and thus it has substantial socioeconomic implications for its regions of influences. Using 73 globally distributed temperature records, Marcott et al. (2013) found that global annual temperature shows an early Holocene maximum, followed by a cooling trend through the middle to late Holocene which ended in the preindustrial era. This finding, however, disagrees with simulated global temperature variations that show a warming trend during the Holocene, mainly attributed to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and retreating ice sheets (Liu et al., 2014). The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is a major component of the global monsoon system and it is initiated by differential sensible heating of continental and oceanic regions (Webster et al., 1998). The ISM plays a crucial role in transporting moisture and heat from the tropical ocean to higher latitudes (Fleitmann et al., 2003; An et al., 2011; Govil and Naidu, 2011). Changes in the ISM have substantial socioeconomic implications for regions under its influence, through changes in water availability."

                "We developed a well-dated, pollen-based summer temperature record (mean July; MJT) for the last 14,000 years from Xingyun Lake in southwest China, where the climate is dominated by the ISM. We propose that summer temperature and precipitation in southwest China were decoupled during the early Holocene. We suggest that greater cloud cover, associated with high precipitation and generated by a strong summer monsoon, may have depressed early Holocene temperatures that would otherwise be driven by greater summer insolation. Therefore we sought to investigate the natural variability of precipitation and temperature during the Holocene in the ISM domains, and to explore their underlying forcing mechanisms, to improve our ability to predict regional and global climate changes."

                "The lack of summer temperature reconstructions from low-latitude land regions makes it difficult to establish temporal patterns of Holocene summer temperature variations across the broader landscape and to determine the underlying forcing mechanisms of temperature change. In addition, the lack of unambiguous precipitation and temperature records with robust chronologies from the same site also limits our ability to address the questions of whether precipitation and temperature respond directly, on orbital time scales, to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation forcing, without a phase lag, or whether the climate response is delayed by internal feedback mechanisms."

In the present study, we compared records from a suite of cores, collected from different parts of the lake, to address the possible occurrence of a sedimentary hiatus in Xingyun Lake during the transition from the late glacial to the early Holocene. Subsequently, we compared the temperature record with monsoonal precipitation records that were inferred from lacustrine carbonate oxygen isotope (d18O) records to study their phase relationship and possible underlying forcing mechanisms."
