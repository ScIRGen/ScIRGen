In contrast, data collection for natural rock samples utilized X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometers to analyze mineral composition, chemical content, and rare earth element occurrences. Both approaches involve detailed testing but emphasize different aspects of material characterization, with synthetic samples focusing more on surface interactions and natural samples on comprehensive composition analysis.",

These techniques allow researchers to infer the physical and chemical processes driving the activation, migration, and enrichment of rare earth elements in weathered and ion-adsorption type deposits. By examining the phases, morphology, and adsorption behaviors of minerals such as kaolinite, halloysite, and goethite, researchers can develop models to describe the intrinsic adsorption constants and the surface complexation processes that contribute to rare earth element distribution in these environments.",

Firstly, samples such as rock cores from drill holes are collected, mechanically crushed, and sectioned. These samples are then tested using instruments like X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) for mineral composition, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for chemical analysis, and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-ES) for rare earth element concentration. Additionally, electron microscopy and visible-shortwave infrared reflection spectroscopy might be used for detailed mineralogical and chemical characterization.",
