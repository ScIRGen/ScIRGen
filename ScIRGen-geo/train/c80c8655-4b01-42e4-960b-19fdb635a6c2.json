Despite the availability of numerous global and regional cropland maps, significant uncertainties and discrepancies persist in terms of overall area and spatial distribution. In this study, we developed high-resolution hybrid cropland maps of China (CCropLand30) by integrating state-of-the-art remote sensing land use and land cover products (i.e., GlobeLand30, GLAD, CLUD, CLCD, and CACD) with the latest national land survey (NLDS). To this end, we proposed a cost-effective data-fusion approach, namely the majority voting-fuzzy agreement score (MV-FAS) method. The accuracy of CCropLand30 and the input cropland maps was evaluated using both visually interpreted and third-party samples, along with county-level NLDS data. CCropLand30 attains an overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and F1-score of 0.88, 0.76, and 0.86, respectively, for the year circa 2020. It demonstrates better agreement with the reference points compared to the input cropland maps, resulting in an enhancement in overall accuracy ranging 10-30%. Moreover, CCropLand30 shows superior spatial consistency with the NLDS data, achieving an average improvement in spatial pattern efficiency by 25%. ",

                "Accurate information on the extents and dynamics of croplands is crucial to address the twin challenges of meeting the growing food needs while reducing environmental footprint. Despite the availability of numerous global and regional cropland maps, significant uncertainties and discrepancies persist in terms of overall area and spatial distribution. Satellite observations provide great opportunities for long-term and large-scale mapping of croplands in a spatially explicit and cost-effective manner. Over the past two decades, a large number of global and regional land use/land cover (LULC) products have been developed utilizing medium to coarse resolution remote sensing data. However, most remote sensing products do not prioritize cropland mapping and have to balance various LULC classes in one mapping approach, which may deteriorate the accuracy of the resulting cropland maps. Moreover, such kinds of data are unable to identify small field patches due to the medium to coarse spatial resolution. In recent years, the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2) and cloud computing platforms has facilitated extensive efforts to create fine-resolution LULC products. Despite these advancements, considerable uncertainties and inconsistencies persist in cropland maps when compared spatially, both in terms of overall area and spatial distribution. These discrepancies arise from the diversity and complexity of agricultural systems, differences in cropland definitions, classification techniques, source data, and the spectral similarity with grassland. Reliable and high-resolution cropland maps are of utmost importance to China, as it sustains 20% of the world's population with only 8% of the global cropland."

                "In this study, we developed high-resolution hybrid cropland maps of China (CCropLand30) by integrating state-of-the-art remote sensing land use and land cover products (i.e., GlobeLand30, GLAD, CLUD, CLCD, and CACD) with the latest national land survey (NLDS). The major contributions of this study are threefold. Firstly, we introduced a bias-insensitive spatial pattern matching metric to evaluate and rank the accuracy of satellite-derived cropland maps. Second, a majority voting-fuzzy agreement score (MV-FAS) method was proposed to fuse multiple remote sensing cropland maps with cropland survey data. Lastly, we created high-resolution and reliable hybrid cropland maps for China by synergistically combining state-of-the-art LULC products with China’s latest national land survey (NLDS). Our newly developed hybrid cropland maps will greatly support cropland monitoring and management, as well as research in diverse fields such as agriculture, water resources, and climate change."

                "Despite the availability of numerous global and regional cropland maps, significant uncertainties and discrepancies persist in terms of overall area and spatial distribution. These discrepancies arise from the diversity and complexity of agricultural systems, differences in cropland definitions, classification techniques, source data, and the spectral similarity with grassland. The selection of suitable cropland map for specific applications poses significant challenges, potentially bringing large uncertainties to the findings of downstream studies. Most of the data-synergy methods require considerable reference data for model training and validation, and meanwhile, the fusion results can be sensitive to the size and representativeness of the training samples. Ensuring the quality and consistency of the samples is challenging due to the varying domain knowledge of the contributors."

                "Our methodology began with the generation of a cropland agreement map by combining the cropland binary maps derived from the selected remote sensing LULC products. Next, the NLDS-reported cropland area was adjusted by incorporating the ridge field area estimates from a random forest model. We then proceeded with a spatial-pattern-oriented assessment and ranking of the candidate cropland maps by using a bias-insensitive and multicomponent spatial pattern matching metric (i.e., SPAEF). Subsequently, the hybrid cropland maps were created by integrating remote sensing cropland maps with the NLDS data through a novel MV-FAS approach. In the fifth step, we evaluated the accuracy of the hybrid cropland maps and the input maps using both visually interpreted and third-party reference points (> 8000). Finally, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of croplands in China during the 2000–2020 period using the newly developed cropland maps."

Our selection was mainly based on the following criteria: (1) the products were developed within the last decade; (2) the products should have a spatial resolution of about 30 m; and (3) the products should cover multiple time periods spanning from 2000 to 2020."

The CCropLand30 product reveals a clear decreasing trend in China’s cropland area from 2000 to 2020. The area of cropland reduced significantly in relatively water-abundant regions but expanded notably in arid and semi-arid regions with scarce water resources, raising concerns about the spatial mismatch between water and land resources in China."

The hybrid cropland maps are then created by integrating these remote sensing maps with NLDS data through the MV-FAS approach. Finally, the accuracy of these maps is evaluated using visually interpreted and third-party reference points.",
