The data coordinates are temporarily an orthogonal coordinate system, where the origin of the coordinates is (142.60E, 30.00N), the x+ azimuth is 83 degrees clockwise from the north, the y+ azimuth is 353 degrees clockwise from the north, and the z+ direction is vertical downwards, in kilometers. The data source method is a three-dimensional finite-difference numerical simulation. The geophysical calculation is ensured after the subduction thermal regime reaches a steady state. The temperature field error range is ±10 degrees Celsius, and the velocity field error range is ±0.1cm/ yr. This data can be used to further analyze the geophysical field of the subduction zone.",

The Izu-Bonin margin is composed of thick sediments and numerous seamounts (Oakley et al., 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2009) with a chain of serpentine seamounts exposed at the forearc slope 40–50 km west of the Izu-Bonin Trench axis (Kamimura et al., 2002). Teleseismic double-difference P-wave tomography was used to image the structural complexity of a tear in the Izu-Bonin slab between 26.5°N and 28°N with unprecedented clarity (Zhao et al., 2017). The deep earthquakes in this region have been caused by the effects of several factors, such as fast slab subduction, slab tearing, slab thermal variations, stress changes and phase transformations in the slab, and complex interactions between the slab and the ambient mantle (e.g., Zhao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019)."

The model region has dimensions of 1000 × 500 × 400 km3 (length × width × depth) that simulate the simultaneous penetration of the incoming plate over 15 Myr. The geometry of the subducted plate is well constrained by Slab2.0 (Hayes et al., 2018), and it is extrapolated within the modelled domain to ensure full subduction and comparatively steady slab thermal conditions (Figures 2 and 3). Based on the thermomechanical models, we focus on the hydrothermal regime in Izu-Bonin and the distributions of fast and slow megathrust earthquakes."
