            "description": "This dataset is a global surface evapotranspiration product based on the PEW model. The PEW model is a water energy equilibrium evapotranspiration model based on the proportionality assumption. Its principle is to couple the Priestley Taylor (PT) evapotranspiration algorithm with a water heat balance framework constructed based on the proportionality assumption. The PEW model can simultaneously consider the impact of water balance constraints and energy budget processes, which improves the simulation accuracy of the PEW model to a certain extent compared to previous models. The input data of PEW includes meteorological and soil moisture change data from the ERA5 land dataset. The time span of this dataset is from 1982 to 2018, with evapotranspiration units of mm/month, monthly temporal resolution, and spatial resolution of 0.1 °. This dataset can provide a basis for studying long-term water cycle and climate change.",
