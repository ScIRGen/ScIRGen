            "description": "In 2017, zircon sorting was completed in Hebei Chengxin Service Co., Ltd., and the samples (5 kg ±) After cleaning and crushing, the samples were crushed to more than 80 mesh by conventional methods and separated by electromagnetic separation. Zircon particles with good crystal shape, transparency, no crack and large enough size were selected as test objects under binocular lens. Zircon target preparation and cathodoluminescence (CL) images were completed in Chongqing Yujin Technology Co., Ltd., which were placed in DevCon epoxy resin and polished to about half of zircon particle size after consolidation, so as to fully expose the interior of zircon. Zircon dating was carried out in the Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The instrument used was la-icp-ms. the instrument model was resolution M50 Agilent 7500a, and the manufacturer was Reynolds Agilent. The spot was 29 μ m。 He gas is used as the carrier of denudation material. Standard zircon plesovice (337.13 ± 0.37 Ma，Sl á 6) and Temora (416 ± 0 Ma, black et al., 2003), NIST srm610 as the external standard and 29Si as the internal standard (the SiO2 content in zircon is 32. 8%). The detailed analysis method is shown in Yuan et al. (2004); The method recommended by Andersen (2002) was used for common lead calibration; The isotopic ratios and REE contents of zircons were calculated by icpmsdatecal (Liu et al., 2010a; Li et al., 2010a; Li et al; Liu et al., 2010b). Isoplot 2006 (Ludwig, 2004) was used for age calculation and concordance mapping.",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS, or Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, is significant in zircon geochronology as it allows for precise measurement of isotopic ratios and trace element concentrations in zircon samples. This method involves laser ablation to sample solid materials, which are then analyzed by the mass spectrometer. The use of standards such as Plesovice and Temora for external calibration and NIST SRM610 for element content standards ensures accuracy and precision in age determination and isotopic analysis. The specific instrumentation and methods described, such as the use of He gas as a carrier, contribute to the reliability and precision of the zircon age data collected.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of zircon age testing using LA-ICP-MS can be influenced by factors including the selection and preparation of zircon samples, such as ensuring good crystal form, transparency, absence of cracks, and sufficient grain size. It also depends on the use of appropriate standards for external calibration, such as Plesovice and Temora zircon standards, and the choice of internal standard elements like 29Si. The sample preparation technique, including embedding in DEVCON epoxy resin and polishing to expose the zircon's interior, as well as the analytical methods for calculating isotopic ratios and trace rare earth element contents, also play crucial roles. Additionally, the calibration and correction methods for common lead, such as those recommended by Andersen (2002), and the software used for data analysis, like ICPMSDATECAL and Isoplot 2006, are significant factors affecting accuracy.",

These standards provide reference points for the calibration of measurements, helping to ensure that zircon age determinations are consistent across different studies. This can enhance the reliability of geological interpretations and contribute to a deeper understanding of regional geochronological events.",

Electromagnetic separation is then employed to sort the samples, selecting zircon grains with good crystal shape, transparency, no cracks, and sufficient particle size under a binocular microscope. The samples are then mounted in DEVCON epoxy resin and polished to expose approximately half of the zircon grain diameter. Cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging is performed to expose the internal features of the zircon.
