            "description": "This dataset includes annual precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), total runoff (R) and the amount of change of water storage (ΔS) in the Qilian Mountains Basin from 1980 to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 0.1°. The dataset is based on the CoLM202X land surface model, the simulation time is 1979-2020, the spin-up time of the model is 1979, the atmospheric driving data of the model adopts the ERA5 dataset, and the surface underlying surface data adopts the surface dataset developed by the land-atmosphere interaction research group of Sun Yat-sen University. These include leaf area index, vegetation type, land use type, canopy height, glacial lake distribution, etc. The precipitation data is calculated from rainfall and snowfall, evapotranspiration and total runoff are the model output data, and the water storage variable is calculated according to the water balance formula (ΔS=P-ET-R). The evapotranspiration was verified at the site scale (RMSE=0.61mm/day), and the estimation results were more reliable, which could provide some data support for ecohydrology-related research.",

                    "Answer": "To generate hydrological simulation data for a specific region over multiple decades using a land surface model, the following steps are involved: First, select an appropriate land surface model, such as CoLM202X. Next, gather atmospheric driving data, like the ERA5 dataset, and surface data, including variables such as leaf area index, vegetation types, land use types, canopy height, and glacier and lake distributions. Initialize the model with a spin-up process to stabilize the variables, starting from the chosen baseline year (e.g., 1979). Run the model over the desired time period (e.g., 1980-2020) to simulate variables such as annual precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), total runoff (R), and water storage changes (ΔS). Precipitation data is obtained from statistical analysis of rainfall and snowfall, while evapotranspiration and total runoff are model outputs. Validate the model's outputs, such as evapotranspiration, using site-specific measurements to ensure reliability, such as achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.61 mm/day. Finally, use the water balance equation (ΔS=P-ET-R) to calculate changes in water storage.",
