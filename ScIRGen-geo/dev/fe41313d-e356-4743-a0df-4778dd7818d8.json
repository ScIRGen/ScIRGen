            "description": "The data set includes the sampling location information of 5 main stream samples and 9 tributary samples (Table 1), the whole sand petrographic information (Table 2) and heavy mineral component information (Table 3) of the Nianchu River sands. The information of total sand components is analyzed by using Gazzi-Dickinson method on 63-2000μm sand under the microscopic identification; Heavy minerals are produced from 32-500μ sand by using heavy liquid and liquid nitrogen, and the heavy mineral components were identified by their optical properties and Raman spectra. The data were collected in the laboratory of provenance analysis at the University of Milano-Bicocca, which has a high quality and credibility. The data set reflects the sediment composition of different tectonic units (Tethys Himalaya, ophiolitic suture, Kangma dome and High Himalaya) drained by the Nianchu river, and can be used to calculate the various sediment contributions of different tectonic units.",
