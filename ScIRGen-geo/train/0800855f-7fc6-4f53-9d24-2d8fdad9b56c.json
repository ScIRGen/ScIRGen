The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data by ICP-MS analysis, the chemical data of hornblende plagioclase minerals by EPMS analysis, the zircon U-Pb isotope data by LA-ICP-MS analysis, the zircon Hf isotope data by mc-la-icp-ms analysis, and the hornblende ar Ar isotope data by gv-5400 mass spectrometer. The above data were obtained in 2017 and published in gsab, a top international geoscience journal. The data are true and reliable. Through this set of data, we can analyze the characteristics of magma source area, understand the regional metamorphism events, and improve the Paleozoic tectonic evolution framework of the Central Asian orogenic belt.",

                    "Answer": "In the geochemical analysis of rocks, using various data collection methods is crucial for obtaining comprehensive and accurate datasets. XRF is used for determining major elemental compositions, while ICP-MS is employed for trace element analysis. EPMS provides mineral chemical data, helpful for understanding mineral compositions. LA-ICP-MS and MC-LA-ICP-MS are techniques for acquiring isotopic data, such as U-Pb and Hf isotopes, which are essential for age dating and tracing geochemical processes. The GV-5400 mass spectrometer is used for Ar-Ar isotopic analysis, aiding in deciphering the thermal history and metamorphic events. Each method contributes unique data critical for understanding the geological history and tectonic evolution of the region.",

For mineral chemistry data of amphibole and plagioclase, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) is employed. Zircon U-Pb isotopic data are acquired using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and zircon Hf isotopic data are obtained using multi-collector laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-LA-ICP-MS). Amphibole Ar-Ar isotopic data are measured using a GV-5400 mass spectrometer. These data were tested in 2017 and have been published in a top international geoscience journal, ensuring their authenticity and reliability.",
