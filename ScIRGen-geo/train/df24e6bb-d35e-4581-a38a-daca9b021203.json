            "description": "The content of the document includes EPMA data of chlorite in Hengdong cobalt deposit, Hunan Province. The experimental methods are as follows: point analysis and X-ray element scanning were performed by Shimadzu epma-1720 electron probe equipped with four wavelength dispersive spectrometers in the Key Laboratory of nonferrous metal metallogenic prediction, Ministry of education, Central South University. All analysis points were determined by high contrast backscattered electron (BSE) images. The operating conditions of point analysis include acceleration voltage of 20 kV, electron beam current of 15 Na, 1-2 μ The beam diameter is less than 10 m, the peak count time is 20 seconds and the background time is 10 seconds. The data can be used for geochemical analysis of Hengdong cobalt deposit in Hunan and similar deposits in Northeast Hunan.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored as a word document.",
