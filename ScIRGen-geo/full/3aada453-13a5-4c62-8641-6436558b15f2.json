                "Grasslands are one of the most widely distributed ecosystems across the globe and account for approximately 25% of the Earth’s land area. It also be noted that grassland around the world are faced with the risk of degradation. This is particularly true for those on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), about half of which (49%) are alpine grasslands. Although the alpine grassland ecosystems on the TP have generally improved in recent years, some grasslands still suffer from varying degrees of degradation. The unique ecological and environmental conditions on the TP present a tremendous challenge to grassland restoration once degradation occurs. The restoration of grassland ecosystems depends strongly on the restoration of grassland vegetation. Grassland restoration measures applied to the TP have included fertilization, reseeding, enclosure-assisted afforestation, and manual grassland cultivation. However, enclosure-assisted afforestation is a “double-edged sword,” as long-term enclosures may reduce the number of species, nutrient value, and soil fertility and may place stress on non-enclosed areas. In recent years, the concept of close-to-nature (CTN) restoration has garnered extensive attention, and has been effectively applied to vegetation restoration. CTN restoration does not completely dispense with conventional manual restoration measures, but instead employs them to help an ecosystem achieve sustainable restoration primarily through self-regulation. This is also a measure suitable for alpine grassland restoration. The groundwork for grassland restoration and ecological reconstruction should center on understanding the present and potential grassland distribution patterns within the study area, that is, answering scientific questions such as to what level the natural grasslands can be restored if the adverse factors are eliminated. Net primary productivity (NPP) can accurately reflect the growth conditions of grassland vegetation, and is sensitive to climate change and human activity, making it a suitable metric for assessing the R of grasslands. Few studies have examined R, and they have used inconsistent methods, as evidenced by the following examples. The TP region is less disturbed by human activities and is an ideal region to study climate and environmental changes."

            "research objective": [
                "Studying the restoration potential (R) of the grasslands on the TP is crucial to the conservation and restoration of its alpine grassland ecosystems. Few studies have assessed the restoration value of the alpine grasslands on the TP. We attempt to estimate the actual (ANPP) and potential net primary productivity (PNPP) of the grasslands on the TP. On this basis, we defined R as the “gap” between the current and highest achievable levels of restoration of a grassland. The results of this study are expected to provide scientific and theoretical support for the formulation of policies and measures aimed at conserving grasslands, as well as restoring ecosystems and degraded grasslands on the TP. In this study, we define PNPP as the top-level in the TP, which not only excludes human disturbances, but also excludes all natural abiotic and biotic disturbances. We attempted to estimate the ANPP and PNPP of the grasslands on the TP, and defined R as the “gap” between the current and highest achievable levels (theoretic) of restoration of a grassland. The results of this study can be used to scientifically identify the current level of restoration, R, and restoration value of different grasslands, and they can provide empirical support for guiding grassland restoration on the TP and relevant R calculation methods."

            "challenges": [
                "Prudent selection of target areas for restoration is a topic of study that has yet to be explored, presenting a challenge to future grassland restoration. In addition, due to the interpolation accuracy of meteorological data, the temperature and precipitation in the Himalayan region in this study may be high, which ultimately leads to the overestimation of R of the Himalayan region in this study. This study still has some limitations. When the CASA model was used to calculate NPP, ε was set to the global general value of 0.389 g C ·MJ−1. However, opinions on ε remain divided. Therefore, further discussion is required to identify a method better suited for estimating the maximum ε of the grasslands on the TP. The CASA, TM, and Chikugo models used in this study are all climate models that estimate NPP by only considering climate factors, which may lead to some uncertainty."

Then, the Thornthwaite memorial model, the principle of similar habitats, and the Chikugo model, were employed to generate PNPP estimates for these grasslands. The CASA model was selected to generate ANPP estimates, whereas the TM model, the PSH, and the Chikugo models were used to produce PNPP estimates (referred to as PNPP1, PNPP2, and PNPP3, respectively). The difference between the PNPP and ANPP of a grassland was defined as its R. The R of the grasslands on the TP and its trend over the period 2001–2019 were quantified."

A notable spatial distribution pattern of high Rs in the southwestern, eastern and middle parts of the TP, and low Rs in the northwestern part of the TP were also identified. Grasslands with a stable R account were the highest proportion (76.13%) of all the grasslands on the TP, followed by those with a decreasing R (19.62%) and those with an increasing R (4.24%). Analysis based on the local conditions of the TP revealed a high restoration value for three types of grassland (i.e., alpine meadows, mountain meadows, and temperate meadow steppes), the grasslands distributed at altitudes of 3000–4000 m, and the grasslands located in the warm temperate zone."
