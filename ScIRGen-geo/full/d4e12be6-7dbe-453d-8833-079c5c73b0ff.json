            "description": "Based on 11 well-acknowledged global-scale microwave remote sensing-based surface soil moisture products, and with 9 main quality impact factors of microwave-based soil moisture retrieval incorporated, we developed the Remote Sensing-based global Surface Soil Moisture dataset (RSSSM, 2003~2020) through a complicated neural network approach. The spatial resolution of RSSSM is 0.1°, while the temporal resolution is approximately 10 days. The original dataset covered 2003~2018, but now it has been updated to 2020. RSSSM dataset is outstanding in terms of temporal continuity, and has full spatial coverage except for snow, ice and water bodies. The comparison against the global-scale in-situ soil moisture measurements indicates that RSSSM has a higher spatial and temporal accuracy than most of the frequently-used global/regional long-term surface soil moisture datasets. In addition, although RSSSM is remote sensing based, without the incorporation of any precipitation data or records, its interannual variation generally conforms with that of precipitation (e.g., the GPM IMERG precipitation data) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Moreover, RSSSM can also reflect the impact of human activities, e.g., urbanization, cropland irrigation and afforestation on soil moisture changes to some degree. The data is in ‘Tiff’ format, and the size after compression is 2.48 GB. The relevant data describing paper has been published in the Journal ‘Earth System Science Data’ in 2021.",

                "Soil moisture plays an important role in modulating the exchange of water, carbon, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere, and it also links the global water, carbon, and energy cycles. Soil moisture has been endorsed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as an essential climate variable because it can indicate the climatic impact on the ecosystems, such as during ecological droughts. Current research requires high-quality soil moisture information in terms of data accuracy and spatio-temporal coverage. With advances of remote-sensing technology, microwave remote sensing became an alternative to soil moisture monitoring. Currently, global-scale soil moisture can be acquired from either passive sensors or active sensors, with that within the top 5 cm of soil being detectable. However, valid temporal spans of all these sensors are limited, and the data quality and spatial coverage were considered to be unsatisfactory until the launch of AMSR-E in June 2002. Interest in fusing satellite-observed and modelled soil moisture has increased recently. The European Space Agency (ESA) published a long-term surface soil moisture dataset called the Climate Change Initiative (CCI), and the latest version (v4.5) covers the time period of 1978–2018. Valid microwave observations were quite limited before June 2002 due to satellite sensor constraints."

Differences in the algorithms dealing with the disturbances make different microwave soil moisture products hardly comparable with each other. The uncertainties arise from meteorological forcing data and model parameters as well as inadequacies in model physics. Moreover, the anthropogenic impacts from irrigation and land cover changes are rarely considered."

                "RSSSM generally presents advantages over other products in arid and relatively cold areas, which is probably because of the difficulty in simulating the impacts of thawing and transient precipitation on soil moisture, and during the growing seasons. Moreover, the persistent high quality during 2003–2018 as well as the complete spatial coverage ensure the applicability of RSSSM to studies on both the spatial and temporal patterns (e.g. long-term trend). RSSSM data suggest an increase in the global mean surface soil moisture. Moreover, without considering the deserts and rainforests, the surface soil moisture loss on consecutive rainless days is highest in summer over the low latitudes (30◦S–30◦N) but mostly in winter over the mid-latitudes (30–60◦N, 30–60◦S). Notably, the error propagation is well controlled with the extension of the simulation period to the past, indicating that the data fusion algorithm proposed here will be more meaningful in the future when more advanced microwave sensors become operational."
