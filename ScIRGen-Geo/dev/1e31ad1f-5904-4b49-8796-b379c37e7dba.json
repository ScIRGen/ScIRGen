      "description": "N fertilizers is an important resource for crop growth. However, the overuse of N fertilizers has led to a series of devastating global environmental issues. Recent studies show that multiple datasets have been created for agricultural N fertilization with varied temporal or spatial resolutions, Nevertheless, how to synchronize and use these datasets becomes problematic due to the inconsistent temporal coverages, spatial resolutions, and crop-specific allocations. Here we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset for crop-specific N fertilization at 5-arc-min resolution (∼10 km by 10 km) during 1961-2020, including N application rate, types, and placements. The N fertilization data was segmented by 21 crop groups, 13 fertilizer types, and 2 fertilization placements. Comparison analysis showed that our dataset is aligned with previous estimates. Our spatiotemporal N fertilization dataset could be used for the land surface models to quantify the effects of agricultural N fertilization practices on food security, climate change, and environmental sustainability.

        "A comprehensive crop-specific N fertilization dataset was reconstructed across the global agricultural soils, including the N application applied to twenty-one crops groups with different fertilizer types and application methods. The gridded crop-specific harvested area (ha) for the year 1961–2020 (Hareacro,y,g) was integrated from gridded harvested area in the year 2000 from the EARTHSTAT 28 and country-level statistics of crop-specific harvested area during the period of 1961–2020 from the FAOSTAT20. The national harvested area from the FAOSTAT 20 was then used to extend the harvested area from the EARTHSTAT28 (as a reference map for the distribution of harvested area) in the year 2000 to the period of 1961–2020. The crop-specific harvested area for each county/district during the period of 1961–2020 (Hareacro,y,i) was mapped onto a grid by spatially disaggregating it using the dynamic cropland distribution from the HYDE3.231. The gridded crop-specific N application rate (including synthetic N fertilizers (SN), crop residues (CR) and manure (MA)) for the year 1961–2020 (Nratecro,y,g) was derived from the gridded N application amount in 1961–2014 developed by Wang et al .24, the country level N consumption for agriculture from the FAOSTAT20 (including SN, CR, and MA), the country-level crop-specific fertilizer consumption from FUBC33 and the N application rate for 21 crop groups from Zhan et al.29. Firstly, the gridded N application amount (divided into SN, CR, and MA) from Wang et al.24 was integrated into the GADM administrative units 32 such as county, district or equivalent that is a lower level subdivision than state or province. Then, SN, MA, and CR application amount from the FAOSTAT20 spanning the period from 1961–2020 were utilized to extend and calibrate the above aggregated N application amount. Lastly, to minimize the uncertainties of crop-specific N application rate, we calibrated crop-specific N application rate after the year 2003 using country-level N synthetic fertilizer consumption reported by the Fertilizer Use By Crop (FUBC)33 for the years 2006, 2007, 2010, 2014 and 2018."
