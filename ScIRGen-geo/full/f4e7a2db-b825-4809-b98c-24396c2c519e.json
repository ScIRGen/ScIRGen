            "description": "The data in this paper include major and trace elements, zircon U-Pb ages and HF isotopes, and detrital zircon U-Pb ages. The samples were collected from basalt and andesite in the Salt Lake area of Western Tibet. Zircon U-Pb geochronology, zircon trace and zircon Hf isotope data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The age, origin and formation background of magmatism in the region can be defined by the data obtained.",

By analyzing these patterns, researchers can infer the age, genesis, and tectonic setting of magmatic activities, providing insights into the geological processes at play during the late Early Cretaceous period. The combination of zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic compositions allows for detailed interpretations of crustal evolution and magma source characteristics.",

The challenges also stem from the geological complexity of the region, the preservation state of the samples, and the calibration and precision of the instruments used.",

By providing accurate age determinations and isotopic compositions, researchers can better constrain the geological history and processes that have shaped the area, including the nature of magma sources and the evolution of the crust.",
