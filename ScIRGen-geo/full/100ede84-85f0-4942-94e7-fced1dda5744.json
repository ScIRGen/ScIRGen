            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace elements, whole rock SR Nd isotopic, zircon U-Pb dating and Lu Hf isotopic data of diorite in atlas porphyry copper gold deposit, Cebu Island, central Philippines. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The whole rock SR Nd isotopes were obtained by MC – ICP – MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can analyze the genetic relationship between lutopan diorite and porphyry copper gold mineralization in atlas deposit.",

                    "Answer": "LA-MC-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) is a precise and accurate technique used to determine zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic composition. It involves using a laser to ablate a small portion of the zircon sample, which is then analyzed by a mass spectrometer to measure isotopic ratios. This method allows researchers to obtain age data and isotopic information critical for understanding geological processes and mineralization events in porphyry copper-gold deposits.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of analytical techniques is influenced by the need to accurately measure different elements and isotopes present in the porphyry copper-gold deposits. XRF is used for major element analysis due to its ability to provide precise quantitative data for bulk samples. ICP-MS is selected for trace element analysis because of its high sensitivity and ability to detect low concentrations of elements. LA-MC-ICP-MS is chosen for zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic analysis as it allows for in-situ measurements and precise isotopic characterization. The reliability of the data published in high-impact scientific journals suggests that these techniques are effective for understanding the geochemical characteristics and genesis of the Lutopan diorite and its relation to porphyry copper-gold mineralization.",

The major element data for the plutonic rocks is obtained through XRF analysis, while trace element data is collected using ICP-MS analysis. Zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu-Hf isotopic composition are obtained using LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. Additionally, whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic data is acquired through MC–ICP–MS analysis. These techniques allow for a comprehensive analysis of the genesis of porphyry copper-gold mineralization in the Lutopan diorite.",
