            "description": "The No. 2 hydrological section is located at 312 Heihe River Bridge (100.411° E, 38.998° N, 1485 m) in the midstream of the Heihe River Basin, Zhangye city, Gansu Province. The dataset contains observations recorded by the No.2 hydrological section from 19 June, 2012, to 31 December, 2013. This section consists of two river sections, i.e., the east section, which is denoted as No. 1 and the west section, which is denoted as No. 2. The width of this section is 90 meters and consists of a gravel bed; the cross-sectional area is unstable because of human factors. The water level was measured using an SR50 ultrasonic range and the discharge was measured using cross-section reconnaissance by the StreamPro ADCP. The dataset includes the following parameters: water level (recorded every 30 minutes) and discharge. The missing and incorrect (outside the normal range) data were replaced with -6999.\nFor more information, please refer to Li et al. (2013) (for hydrometeorological observation network or sites information), He et al. (2016) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
