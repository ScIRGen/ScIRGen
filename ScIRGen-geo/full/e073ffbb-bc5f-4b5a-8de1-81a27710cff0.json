            "description": "Snow water equivalent (SWE) is one of the important parameters to characterize the water resources of snow cover and sensitive to global climate change. A spatiotemporal gradient boosting model (XGBoost) was developed, combining five SWE products (GlobSnow, ERA5-Land, ERA-Interim, GLDAS, and 1980–2020 China daily snow water equivalent product dataset) and spatiotemporal covariates (land cover, temperature, snow-related, geospatial, and temporal features). This model considers the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of SWE and the nonlinear relationship between SWE and multiple influencing factors. Evaluations results on daily SWE records from 647 meteorological sites in China demonstrates the effectiveness of the model with R values of 0.77,0.70, and MAE and RMSE values of 7.54, 8.62 mm and 12.29, 13.73mm. Based on this model, daily snow water equivalent product with a resolution of 0.25 degrees in China was produced from 1980 to 2020. This dataset provides more accurate snow water equivalent data for snow water management.",

                "Accurate snow water equivalent (SWE) data are crucial for estimating the water supply capacity of snow and are of profound importance for the communities of hydrology, climatology, and ecology. Snow occupies over 50% of the land area in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter and is a crucial element of the cryosphere and global energy cycle due to its high albedo and low thermal conductivity. Snowmelt runoff provides a stable and reliable water supply for terrestrial rivers in mid- and high-latitude areas, and more than one-sixth of the world population depends upon glaciers and seasonal snowpacks for water. Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is a measure of the water content in a snowpack and represents the amount of water available for runoff. Therefore, it has significant impacts on hydrological processes, climate, and ecosystems. SWE estimation methods include spatial interpolation estimation based on ground-measured sites, data assimilation, passive microwave remote sensing inversion, active microwave remote sensing inversion, reconstruction, physical models, and lidar measurement technology. Among the various methods, passive microwave remote sensing inversion, data assimilation, and reconstruction methods are widely used to produce vast-area and long-term SWE products, namely, satellite-based SWE, data assimilation SWE, and reanalysis SWE, respectively. Satellite-based SWE products observe brightness temperature as a function of snowpack properties and possess advantages in identifying the spatial pattern and temporal variation of SWE. Data assimilation SWE products are generally derived from Land Data Assimilation Systems by using ground-based observations, remote sensing products, and/or reanalysis forcing. Compared to data assimilation SWE, reanalysis SWE products provide relatively more continuous and integral records based on a numerical weather prediction model, which assimilates earth observations over a long historical period into the weather prediction model. However, in addition to the above-mentioned advantages, different SWE products have disadvantages in terms of uncertainty and incompleteness. The uncertainty of satellite-based products is mainly attributed to topographic and climatic factors, and that of reanalysis and data assimilation products is partly attributed to several structural errors and inputs of in situ data, such as altitude bias caused by spatial differences between grids and sites. Regarding data incompleteness, due to the limited detection capability of passive microwaves in mountainous regions, GlobSnow SWE only provides terrestrial non-mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere between latitudes 35°–85°N, excluding glaciers and Greenland. Moreover, existing SWE products are inconsistent with each other and show diverse spatiotemporal patterns. A comparison of five SWE gridded products throughout the Northern Hemisphere was conducted, showing that the consistency of five products is only approximately 50% in the climatological peak snow mass. As a result, these datasets exhibited exceedingly distinct SWE trends."

Using the proposed model, a dataset of daily SWE from 1980 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 25 km over China is provided, aiming to deliver accurate SWE data for hydrological research and water resource management."

            "challenges": [
                "First, the performance of the XGBoost model is partly dependent on the abundance of observation samples. The insufficient number and relatively uneven distribution of samples would result in uncertainty for the model, e.g., the model accuracy in May (samples of 76) and that in QTP (samples of 355) are inferior to other periods and regions, respectively. Second, the QTP has the most complex terrain conditions among the three stable snow cover areas in China, which poses a great challenge to SWE estimation. In addition, the performances of the member products vary in QTP: ERA5-Land and GLDAS show plentiful abnormally high values (> 200 mm), while ERA-Interim and CSWE show very low values (< 30 mm). Third, the uncertainty from scaling differences should not be ignored. The limited representation of in situ SWE sites makes it challenging to evaluate SWE estimates at the gridded scale."

Specifically, we conduct SWE accuracy evaluations using ground measurement data from 2013 to 2017 based on the annual and site cross-validation strategy to validate the spatiotemporal prediction of the model."
