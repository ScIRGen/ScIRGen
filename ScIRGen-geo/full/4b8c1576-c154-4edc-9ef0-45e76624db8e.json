            "description": "This data set mainly includes the results of Si isotopic analysis of jadeite rocks collected from Myanmar's hkamti jadeite deposit. The samples are from 160 ma. The geographical location of the sample is about 24.2 n °~ twenty-four point six °， East longitude: 94.2 °~ ninety-five point four °。 The samples include white jadeite, green jadeite, serpentinite, mica rich quartz schist, etc. the Si isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation. After the sample was digested by acid and separated by ion exchange resin, the silicon isotope was measured by MC-ICPMS, and the international standard samples were selected to monitor the test data. The test was completed from August 30, 2018 to June 30, 2019. The data obtained are found to be high δ The deep-sea siliceous rocks of 30Si may be the main source of silicon in subduction zone magma. The data provide information for tracing the source of silicon in subduction zone fluid",

                    "Answer": "MC-ICPMS is chosen for Si isotope analysis in jadeite rocks because it allows precise and accurate measurement of isotopic ratios. This method impacts data quality positively by providing reliable and reproducible results, especially when international standard samples are used for monitoring the test data. This ensures that the isotopic data are suitable for tracing the sources of Si in subduction zone fluids, as the dataset reveals high δ30Si values in deep-sea siliceous rocks, indicating their significant role as a source of silicon in subduction zone magmas.",

The samples, which include white jadeite, green jadeite, serpentine, and mica-rich quartz schist, undergo acid digestion followed by separation using ion exchange resins. After preparation, the Si isotopes are analyzed using MC-ICPMS (Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). The analysis is monitored against international standard samples to ensure data accuracy. The testing took place between August 30, 2018, and June 30, 2019.",
