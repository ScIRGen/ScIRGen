            "description": "This dataset contains the automatic weather station (AWS) measurements from site No.17 in the flux observation matrix from 12 May to 17 September, 2012. The site (100.36972° E, 38.84510° N) was located in an orchard in Daman irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1559.63 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity (HMP45C; 5 m, towards north), air pressure (PTB110; 2 m), rain gauge (52203; 10 m), wind speed and direction (034B; 10 m, towards north), a four-component radiometer (CNR1; 6 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, vertically downward), soil temperature profile (109; 0, -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, and -1.0 m), and soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates with one below the vegetation and the other between plants, 0.06 m). One of the infrared temperature sensors (IRT_2) was adjusted to a zenith angle of 50° after 6 August.\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), air pressure (press, hpa), precipitation (rain, mm), wind speed (Ws_10 m, m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m, °), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation; W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IR_2, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, below the vegetation; Gs_2 and Gs_3, W/m^2), soil temperature profile (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_60 cm, and Ts_100 cm, ℃), and soil moisture profile (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_60 cm, and Ms_100 cm, %).\n  The data processing and quality control steps were as follows. (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min; therefore, there were 144 records per day. The missing data were filled with -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) In this dataset, the time of 0:10 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:10; the data were stored in *.xlsx format. (5) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
                "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
                "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

This complexity is further exacerbated in heterogeneous landscapes where the separation of soil and canopy temperatures is crucial for reliable estimations, and errors in temperature separation can significantly affect model performance.",

                    "Answer": "The availability of multiscale observations is critical because eco-hydrological processes occur at various scales and are influenced by interactions between different landscape features. Progress is hindered by the lack of such observations, and multiscale datasets provide comprehensive data to address challenges such as capturing the interactions in oasis-desert systems and understanding the spatial variability of these processes.",

                    "Answer": "The field highlights that upscaling eco-hydrological processes on heterogeneous surfaces is challenging due to the poor availability of multiscale observations. Despite the use of hierarchically nested scales and diverse instrumentation, capturing multi-scale eco-hydrological processes remains difficult, largely due to the variability in landscape features and the complexity of accurately measuring interactions between different environmental components.",

                    "Answer": "To capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes in an oasis-desert system, instruments were arranged on hierarchically nested scales, including a sparse network with a superstation in the oasis, four EC towers, and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations in different surrounding landscapes. Additionally, intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.",

                    "Answer": "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is particularly challenging. The major challenges include the incomplete energy balance closure with respect to available energy, the uncertainty in surface–air temperature differences, and errors in determining surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from composite radiometric temperatures. Errors in image classification, particularly in arid regions, and uncertainties in estimating incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy also contribute to the challenges in using ground-based methods for evapotranspiration measurement.",

Additionally, a network of eco-hydrological sensors for soil moisture and leaf area index is used, along with hyper-resolution airborne remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR, imaging spectrometer, multi-angle thermal imager, and L-band microwave radiometer. Intensive observations are carried out during specific periods, and instruments are arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes, including oasis-desert interactions.",

                    "Answer": "The methodologies involve using the TSEB model, which requires the calculation of soil and canopy component temperatures using thermal infrared images. The visible and NIR images are classified into soil and canopy pixels, and the directional brightness temperatures are extracted. The Craig–Gordon model is applied to partition evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration using ground-based measurements, such as air temperature, wind speed, humidity, and radiometric temperatures. The data from these measurements are validated against surface radiometric temperatures and stable isotope techniques to improve accuracy.",
