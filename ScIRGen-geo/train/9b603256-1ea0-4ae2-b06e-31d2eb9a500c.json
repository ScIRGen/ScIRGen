The Pan-Third Pole vegetation coverage data was obtained from global GLASS vegetation coverage products based on the boundary of the Pan-Third Pole. The global vegetation coverage products provide the global vegetation coverage 2000 to 2021, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 °. The vegetation index data is obtained from the Global AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) dataset (1981-2015). The temporal resolution of the product is twice a month, while the spatial resolution is 1/12 of a degree. The vegetation phenology data is obtained from global phenology product, which is produced according to the AVHRR data. The dataset includes the start of the growing season (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS), with a spatial resolution of 500 m.",

FAPAR expresses the energy absorption capacity of vegetation, plays a critical role in the carbon cycle, and is an essential climate variable identified by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Satellite observations provide the only feasible way to estimate FAPAR at regional and global scales. Many algorithms have been developed to retrieve FAPAR from satellite remote sensing data, and multiple global FAPAR products have been generated from data acquired by the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and SPOT/VEGETATION."

                "The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments has been crucial to study a variety of global land vegetation processes and how they vary in time. Although AVHRR sensors were not originally intended as a climate mission, their early success for vegetation studies was due to a reconfiguration of the instruments to have non-overlapping (“visible”) channel one (0.58–0.68 µm) and (near-infrared) channel two (0.725–1.10 µm) spectral bands. Since spectral vegetation indices are a surrogate for photosynthetic potential, the long record of AVHRR NDVI data has become particularly relevant for continued long-term monitoring of land surface. However, the difficulties in processing AVHRR NDVI data are to properly deal with several limitations of the AVHRR instrument or operation, e.g., vicarious post-launch calibration, atmospheric and cloud correction, and bias correction for the systematic orbital drift during the life of the individual TIROS-N missions. Among-instrument calibration is a prerequisite to observing and documenting the land variability and it is particularly challenging for the AVHRR because, by design, the instrument does not have fully onboard calibration for the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) channels and must rely on external references. The VNIR channels are sensitive to atmospheric conditions since they are spectrally broad and thus both require additional data for correcting aerosol effects and cloud contamination. Despite the limitations of the AVHRR/2 design features, the over-riding requirement for data consistency to study potentially varying effects of climate on vegetation can result in their persistence over the lifetime of the instrument series and it could even preclude new ideas to improve the design if they would affect data continuity."

Orbital drift of the NOAA-7 to NOAA-14 satellites carrying AVHRR/2 instruments adds to the challenge since the NOAA satellite overpass times drifted from the nominal 1:30 pm overpass time by as much as 4.5 hours toward evening, creating variable illumination and view angles. The AVHRR global area coverage (GAC) data have a unique sampling method. The uncertainty in AVHRR calibration has been the major limiting factor of ocean aerosol retrievals with this instrument."
