            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with Landsat TM was obtained in the A'rou foci experimental area from Jul. 10 to Jul. 12, 2008. The stellera and the whin coverage were mainly measured.\n     Photos were taken in No. 2 quadrate of A'rou and an optional stellera land for coverage mesurement from Jul. 10 to 11, shooting straight downwards at the height of 1.5 m. The fisheye camera was Nikon D80 with a lens of Sigma 8mm F3.5 EX DG CIRCULAR FISHEYE.\n     The vegetation height was measured on Jul. 12. One grid of 5m×5m was chosen in each of the eight quadrates (60m×60m or 120m×120m) and compartmentalized into 2.5m×2.5m, in which GPS positions by GARMIN GPS 76, species, the plant number and height were measured. \n     Four files were included, the quadrates coordinates, stellera observations in No. 2 quadrate,  the stellera quadrat investigation and TM quadrate investigation.",

The Nikon D80 camera with a Sigma 8mm F3.5 EX DG CIRCULAR FISHEYE lens is employed for capturing images at a height of 1.5 meters, aimed directly downwards. This method is used to measure coverage in selected sample plots. In addition, small plot measurements involve randomly selected plots along routes, with dimensions of either 60m×60m or 120m×120m, divided into 5m×5m grids. These grids are further split into 2.5m×2.5m sections where parameters like toxic plant count, height, species, and GPS points are recorded, using GARMIN GPS 76 to document GPS coordinates. This data provides ground-truthing for remote sensing vegetation coverage estimation.",
