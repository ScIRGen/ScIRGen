However, for a long time, human geography has been based on administrative unit and physical geography has been based on natural elements unit, so, space units are not unified, which makes interaction analysis of people and environment difficult and becomes an obstacle to the progress in global change research. Spatialization of humanities data is one of the best solutions, which means spreading statistics type of humanities data over a certain size distribution of the geographic grid, in order to build up a high-resolution humanities spatial database. The characteristics of remote sensing data are wide range accessed, fast, multi-technical, quick updated and dynamic monitoring of multi-dimensional features. Spatialization statistics based on remote sensing is still on the continuous exploring and developing stage. In recent years, researchers began to explore the relationship between gross domestic product(GDP) and land use database supported by remote sensing, so as to achieve the spatial distribution of GDP."

In the study, the output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery in primary industry correspond with farmland, woodland, grassland, waters in land use respectively; the value of secondary industry corresponds with built up area; the relationship between tertiary industry and land use is not easy to determine. Therefore, after testing and comparison repeatedly, urban, rural residential and other built up area is corresponding to tertiary industry by reason of the best correlation.
