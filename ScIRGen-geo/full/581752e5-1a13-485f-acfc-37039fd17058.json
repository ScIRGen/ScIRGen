            "description": "Research on the spatial distribution and dynamic change of soil and water heat in Central Asian countries under the background of climate change can provide support for the development of water and soil resources and agricultural production in Central Asian countries, which is of great significance for the social stability of the core region of the \"Silk Road Economic Belt\". Based on meteorological, water resources, land use and remote sensing data, this paper analyzes the current situation of water and soil resources development and utilization in Central Asia, and introduces the water and heat product index as the water and heat factor, and uses linear trend analysis and partial correlation analysis to study the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of water and soil heat resources in Central Asia in 1995, 2005 and 2015 Equivalent coefficient is used to evaluate the matching characteristics and shortage degree of agricultural water and soil resources. The data set adopts Albers projection, including the spatial distribution of annual precipitation resources, heat resources and cultivated land resources in Central Asia. This data set is intended to provide basic data for the follow-up analysis of agricultural resources, natural regionalization and vulnerability of water, soil and heat resources in Central Asia.",
