            "description": "一. Data overview\n      In the heihe river basin simulation model development and environment construction of cross integration research, project support, ren-sheng Chen (RReDC) in the center of the renewable energy data provided by the model, on the basis of considering the data of heihe river and other radiation model parameterization scheme, by 1 km resolution DEM, heihe surface weather observation data and NECP reanalysis data, the preparation of total radiation, direct radiation and scattering radiation three data sets.\n二, data processing process\n1) data source\nWatershed basic data mainly include DEM data, as well as slope and slope direction data generated thereby.The model adopts Alberts equal area conic projection), the grid size is 1km*1km, a total of 411×562 grids, that is, the actual calculated area is about 23*10^4 km^2.The calculated year is 2002, and the temporal resolution is 1h.\nTwo sets of NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data were used, one set was instantaneous data of 1°*1° per 6h, mainly ozone and precipitable data.The other set is based on the assimilation data of 4 times a day of 192*94 grid (which is the average value per 6h), mainly the data of total cloud cover and precipitation rate.The main reason for applying the two sets of data is that the total cloud cover changes dramatically with time, and the instantaneous data cannot control the overall change of the weather.However, it is impossible to control the weather change within 6 hours by using the average data of 6 hours.\n2) method\nA. Short-wave solar incident radiation model in clear sky horizontal plane.Rayleigh scattering, aerosol absorption, water vapor absorption, ozone absorption and heterogeneous mixed gases (O2, CO2, etc.) are mainly considered in the calculation of direct radiation from clear sky.\nB. Short-wave radiation model of clear-sky solar incidence under arbitrary topographic conditions.According to the principle of solid geometry and the algorithm of the short-wave radiation of horizontal plane, a simple algorithm of the short-wave radiation considering the self-masking effect of mountain slopes is designed.\nC. Calculation of solar incident short-wave radiation under arbitrary terrain conditions in actual weather.Based on the Ver4Fortran source code provided by Dr. Harry d. K of the Greek institute of meteorology and atmospheric physics.\nD. Spatial interpolation adopts the three-dimensional interpolation method based on triangular grid. The time interpolation of the first set of data adopts linear interpolation.\nFor specific algorithm description, please refer to: Chen rensheng, kang ersi, et al. (2006). \"model of hourly incident short-wave radiation under arbitrary terrain and actual weather conditions -- a case study of heihe river basin.\" Chinese desert (05).\n3) data verification\nThe simulation results were verified by using the total radiation observation data of three automatic meteorological stations located in the mountainous area, xishui, linze in the middle reaches and ejinaqi in the lower reaches. The calculated results of the total radiation of xishui were relatively poor, with R2 = 0.71.The measured and calculated results of total radiation of linze and ejin flags are better, with R2 of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively.\n4) conclusion\nIt is a feasible method to calculate the solar incident short-wave radiation with large range, long time and high spatial and temporal resolution under any terrain and actual weather conditions by combining the radiation transmission parameterization scheme and remote sensing information, especially in the northwest arid region.The established model only USES DEM data of the basin and the slope and slope direction data generated thereby, while other data are reanalysis data, so it is easy to be popularized and applied.The weather changes at any time in high mountain areas. The main reason for the poor calculation effect of the model in high mountain areas is still the low spatial and temporal resolution of the total cloud cover data. Meanwhile, the inconsistency between the calculated value and the measured value partly leads to the poor comparison results.",

                "Understanding cryospheric hydrology and the effects of cryospheric changes on river runoff is critical for sustainable water management especially in arid inland river basins such as those in northwest China where water resources mainly come from alpine areas. The Earth’s cryosphere is facing rapid changes in the duration, extent, and mass of snow and ice, which have had multiple impacts on the environment across a range of temporal and spatial scales. Changes in mountain snow, glaciers, and permafrost have resulted in significant downstream impacts in terms of the quantity, seasonality, and quality of water. This shrinkage has modified the water cycle and river discharge in cold regions and caused the rise of global mean sea level. Serving as a solid reservoir for many endorheic and exorheic basins, the mountain cryosphere is the regulator of major rivers and provides most of the water resources in arid regions in China and its neighboring countries. However, because of inadequate observation data and the lack of knowledge about many aspects of cryospheric hydrometeorology at regional scales in alpine regions, the significance of the impacts of cryospheric changes and the severity of their consequences remain unclear in China."

Four key science questions have been identified: The spatial and temporal distribution of alpine precipitation need to be determined. The effects of cryospheric changes on streamflow need to be determined. The effects of changes in the vegetation pattern in the vertical landscape zones on water balance and river runoff in the mountains must be assessed.

                "Each AWS features the long-term monitoring of the following meteorological variables: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, four-component radiation, soil heat flux, land surface temperature (LST), soil temperature, soil moisture, snow depth, and precipitation amount. We also conducted long-term standard meteorological field (SMF) manual observations for reference to those obtained at AWS. The total discharge has been monitored by a continuously stream-gauging station at the catchment outlet since 2009. From 2009 to 2012, we also manually used the float protocol and a stopwatch to estimate the nonfreezing period discharge in a meadow subcatchment and a moraine–talus subcatchment. To apply hydrological models in the alpine catchment, we have obtained long-term continuous soil parameter data in the soil pit synchronously with those collected at AWS. An SI-111 infrared radiometer (Apogee Instr. Inc.) was used to measure the LST. During the early stage of the CHOICE, evapotranspiration was measured with two manual weighing microlysimeters, which were 40 cm in depth and 31.5 cm in diameter and were installed in the SMF at the Hulu-1 field on 1 July 2009 with an electronic scale of 2 g (0.026 mm) in precision. With the development of the CHOICE, five automatic microlysimeters (CHOICE-LYS40, T&D) were arranged in the same field as the AWS of the Hulu-1 to Hulu-5 field in August 2013. An EC150 system (Campbell Scientific Inc.) was installed on a lattice mast at 5.8 m at the Hulu-2 field in September 2011. Four cluster wells were installed in 2011 and 2014 for groundwater monitoring and sampling. On fixed-point scale, six SR50A Sonic Ranging Sensors (Campbell Scientific Inc.) measure snow depth synchronously with AWS. In this system, three thermistor cables were installed that crossed the riverbed–water, water–ice, and ice–air interfaces. We conduct the work of precipitation intercomparisons by referring to the Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment of the WMO using pit gauges and a double reference intercomparison reference (DFIR) gauge. Precipitation measurements in the Hulu catchment were performed with six total rain-weighing sensors (TRwS204, MPS System Ltd) with a single alter shield and synchronized with AWS. Fourteen LST observation sites with similar elevations but different aspects and slopes were built around the Hulu-3 field. Two LST observation sites were built to analyze the influences of plants on LST. To study the runoff process of canopy precipitation to surface runoff in different landscapes, two runoff fields (shrubs and meadows) (15 by 3 m) were established at a shrub-encroached alpine meadow hillslope in September 2010. Four methods were used to measure soil water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity in the Hulu-1 field including a single-ring infiltrometer, a double-ring infiltrometer, a Hood infiltrometer (Hood IL-2700, Germany), and the ring cutter method. Groundwater samples used for isotope analysis were collected from 12 wells between 2014 and 2016, and stream water samples were collected from 12 sites that were approximately evenly distributed from upstream to downstream between 2011 and 2016. A Picarro GasScouter G4301 gas concentration analyzer with a re-entry control system and six respiration chambers installed on the permafrost zone of the Hulu catchment in August 2017. The observation period of canopy precipitation interception began in June 2010. A total of four sap flow sensors (CAF, ECOMATIK) were installed to estimate transpiration. Variations in the diversity of the soil microbial community under meadow, shrub, marshy meadow, and moraine–talus were observed along an elevation gradient in the Hulu catchment in July 2013. An AWS was erected at the top of the glacier (4817 m asl) in September 2015; the site is not affected by the surrounding mountains. To obtain reliable turbulent data, EC system measurements were made adjacent to the AWS at a height of 4 m beginning in October 2017. To harvest the water contained in fog, five identical standard fog collectors were installed at Hulu-1 to Hulu-5 in July 2014. A warming simulation experiment was begun in September 2016. Two flight campaigns were performed in the Hulu catchment."

According to the six AWS of the CHOICE obtained throughout the Hulu catchment and peripheral precipitation data from five China Meteorological Administration stations (Zhangye, Minle, Sunan, Qilian, and Yeniugou), two or more yearly EMPs exist in the northern Qilian Mountains. A diminished accumulation zone will result in a reduction in the transport and expansion of the glaciers, and then the glaciers will have to retreat to limit themselves to reduce ablation. Based on 10-yr observations in the western cold regions of China, especially those obtained in the Upper Hei River basin (UHR), a new CBHM was created to evaluate the effects of cryospheric changes on stream flow from the UHR. In the past 50 yr, river runoff has generally shown an increasing trend as a result of increased rainfall, snowfall, and glacial runoff in the cold regions of western China."
