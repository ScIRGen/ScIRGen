      "description": "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological security barrier area for China and even Asia, and a global hotspot for biodiversity conservation. Safeguarding ecological security is the core task of ecological protection on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Ecological security barrier refers to a regional ecosystem whose pattern, structure and process are in a constant or less disturbed state, forming a stable pattern composed of multi-level and orderly ecosystems, providing multiple material production and ecosystem services for human societies, thus ensuring the ecological security and sustainable development of the surrounding areas and countries. With the support of the the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program, the research team formed an indicator group for identifying the key areas of the ecological security barrier from the four dimensions of ecosystem function/service importance, ecological environment sensitivity, human activity exposure and climate change adaptability. Finally, four types of ecological security barrier key areas are identified: ecosystem function conservation areas, high ecological value-degradation risk prevention areas, high ecological value-human pressure mitigation areas, and ecological environment sensitive areas. And further combined with the regional ecological sensitivity assessment, the secondary classification of ecological security barrier key areas was delineated. The relevant research have an important supporting role in guiding the scientific layout of ecological protection and restoration projects, and comprehensively improving the quality and function of the ecological barrier on the Tibetan Plateau.",

        "Protected areas (PAs) are the mainstream and extensive solution for conserving and restoring biodiversity by limiting human impacts. However, many PAs are experiencing rapid climate change, which is a major threat to biodiversity and hampers PA’s core objective. Climate refugia, defined as buffer regions for species against exposure to changes in climatic conditions, are expected to mitigate the climate change impact on biodiversity and reinforce the PAs’ effectiveness. The importance of climate refugia has been widely demonstrated, although the approach by which they are identified is diverse. In general, environmental diversity and climatic velocity are the two main criteria. Internal ecosystem processes have received scant consideration in identifying climate refugia despite their potential significance. Incorporating climate refugia into PAs conservation planning can potentially increase PAs conservation effectiveness. An ideal area to explore these aspects is the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in China, which is located in two crucial global biodiversity hotspots (the Mountains of Southwest China and the Himalayas). Over the past decades, the Chinese government has gradually established several nature reserves (NRs, the primary type of PAs), forming a dense PAs network to protect these sensitive ecosystems."

        "The aim of this study is multifold: (1) to map the climate refugia based on different approaches; (2) to discuss the inconsistencies among various types of climate refugia; (3) to investigate the elevation gradient characteristics of climate refugia distribution; and (4) to identify the relationship between NRs and climate refugia."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "The inconsistent distribution of different types of climate refugia weakens the potential of functional complementarity. Comprehensive and comparative studies on PAs’ coverage and evolution of climate refugia using different approaches are still lacking. The current distribution of NRs on the TP covered a limited proportion of climate refugia (9.9%-25.2%). The low coverage is primarily due to a spatial mismatch between NRs locations and climate refugia. Some limitations and uncertainties should be further addressed in this study. First, the climatic velocity approach, which is species-neutral, does not account for the climatic requirements of individual species due to data availability. Our analysis is also affected by limitations stemming from data resolution. Another concern is the uncertainty of climate models."
      ],
      "methods": [
        "To identify the climate refugia, we used enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from MOD13Q1 (250 m-resolution and 16 day-frequency) and land surface temperature (LST) from MOD11A2 (1 km-resolution and 8 day-frequency) from 2001 to 2020. We collected these datasets from Google Earth Engine and selected only high-quality images according to the MODIS Quality Assurance flags. Also, we used a land cover dataset from MCD12Q1 with 500 m resolution and a digital elevation model (DEM) from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission with 90m resolution. We collected future climate data (annual mean temperature and annual precipitation) from WorldClim database generated from 8 CMIP6 global climate models. We developed and compared five metrics of environmental diversity (elevation, landcover, EVI, summer LST, and winter LST). We extracted the STD from 20 years (2001-2020) of vegetation phenology to describe the phenology stability. The calculation of future climatic velocity was derived from dividing the temporal gradient of climate change by the spatial gradient of climate variability and then obtaining the velocity variable. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyze the relationships among the different climate refugia indicators. The climate refugia priority areas were delimited by considering areas where each indicator is in the respective top 20%. NRs’ boundary was introduced to identify the conservation gaps between the NRs and climate refugia identified by 8 indicators, using a spatial overlap analysis."
