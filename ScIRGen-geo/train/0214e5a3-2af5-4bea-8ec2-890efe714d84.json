            "description": "Based on the data information provided by the data management center of Heihe project, the daily humidity data of 21 regular meteorological observation stations in Heihe River Basin and its surrounding areas and 13 national reference stations around Heihe River were collected and calculated. The spatial stability analysis is carried out to calculate the coefficient of variation. If the coefficient of variation is greater than 100%, the geographical weighted regression is used to calculate the relationship between the station and the geographical terrain factors, and the monthly humidity distribution trend is obtained; if the coefficient of variation is less than or equal to 100%, the common least square regression is used to calculate the relationship between the station humidity value and the geographical terrain factors (latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, aspect, etc.) The residual after removing the trend was fitted and corrected by HASM (high accuracy surface modeling method). Finally, the monthly average humidity distribution of the Heihe River Basin in 1961-2010 is obtained by adding the trend surface results and the residual correction results. Time resolution: monthly average humidity for many years from 1961 to 2010. Spatial resolution: 500M.",

                    "Answer": "The High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method (HASM) is a technique used for fitting and correcting residuals after trend removal in spatial data. In the context of the dataset related to the Heihe River Basin's multi-year monthly average humidity, HASM is applied to the residuals that remain after the trend surfaces are determined through regression analysis. The goal of using HASM is to achieve a high level of accuracy in modeling the surface of the spatial data, ensuring that the final distribution of multi-year monthly average humidity is as precise as possible.",

In data collection and analysis, these factors can be accounted for by calculating the coefficient of variation to assess spatial stability. If the coefficient of variation is greater than 100%, geographic weighted regression can be used to analyze the relationship between station data and geographic and topographic factors to determine monthly humidity distribution trends. If the coefficient is less than or equal to 100%, ordinary least squares regression can be applied to calculate the relationship between station humidity values and geographic and topographic factors. The residuals after removing these trends can be further corrected using the High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method (HASM) to improve the accuracy of the humidity distribution map.",

                    "Answer": "The variability in spatial stability of long-term average humidity data trends is influenced by factors such as the relationship between humidity values and geographical terrain characteristics, including latitude, elevation, slope, and aspect. These factors are analyzed using geographic weighted regression or ordinary least squares regression, depending on the coefficient of variation. A high coefficient of variation (>100%) indicates a need for geographic weighted regression to examine these relationships, while a lower coefficient allows for ordinary least squares regression.",

                    "Answer": "The use of geographic weighted regression (GWR) can enhance the spatial accuracy of湿度 distribution mapping in areas where the变异系数 is greater than 100%, as it accounts for spatial non-stationarity by considering relationships between station sites and geographic terrain factors. In contrast, ordinary least squares regression is used when the变异系数 is 100% or less, assuming spatial stationarity, which may not capture local variations as accurately in diverse terrain conditions. Therefore, GWR is expected to provide a more nuanced representation of湿度 trends in complex terrains within the Heihe River Basin.",

Daily humidity data is compiled and averaged to obtain long-term monthly data for each station from 1961 to 2010. Spatial stability is analyzed using the coefficient of variation. If the coefficient exceeds 100%, geographically weighted regression is used to model the relationship between station data and geographical factors, deriving monthly humidity distribution trends. If the coefficient is 100% or less, ordinary least squares regression is used for this purpose. Residuals after trend removal are fitted and corrected using the High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method (HASM). Finally, the trend surface results and corrected residuals are combined to obtain the long-term average monthly humidity distribution from 1961 to 2010, with a spatial resolution of 500 meters.",
