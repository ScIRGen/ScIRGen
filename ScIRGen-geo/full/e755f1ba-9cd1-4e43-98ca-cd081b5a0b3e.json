            "description": "Nighttime light remote sensing has been an increasingly important proxy for human activities including socioeconomics and energy consumption. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System from 1992 to 2013 and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite since 2012 are the most widely used datasets. Despite urgent needs for long-term products and pilot explorations in synthesizing them, the publicly available long-term products are limited. We propose a Night-Time Light convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (NTLSTM) network, and apply the network to produce annual Prolonged Artificial Nighttime-light DAtaset (PANDA) in China from 1984 to 2020. Model assessments between modelled and original images show that on average the Root Mean Squared-Error (RMSE) reaches 0.73, the coefficient of determination (R2) reaches 0.95, and the linear slope is 0.99 at pixel level, indicating a high confidential level of the data quality of the generated product. In urban areas, the modelled results can well capture temporal trends in newly built-up areas but slightly underestimate the intensity within old urban cores. Socioeconomic indicators (built-up areas, Gross Domestic Product, population) correlates better with the PANDA than with previous products in the literature, indicating its better potential in finding different controls of nighttime-light variances in different phases. Besides, the PANDA delineates different urban expansion types, outperforms other products in representing road networks, and provides potential nighttime-light sceneries in early years. PANDA provides the opportunity to better bridge the cooperation between human activity observations and socioeconomic or environmental fields",

DMSP-OLS time-series data from 1992 to 2012 is retrieved from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website. As for the training and evaluation period of deep learning, the training and evaluation material is generated by randomly cropping the raw DMSP NTL images into patches with the size of 1,024 × 1,024 pixels. The generated patches are divided into training, validating, and testing materials in a proportion of 7:2:1. Nine ancillary data sets are collected to help validate the accuracy or performance of PANDA-China, including six other existing global nighttime-light products, and Population (POP), Gross Domestic Products (GDP), built-up areas (BUA). We develop a stepwise method to achieve the extended NTL datasets consisting of the following five steps: Step 1: The raw DMSP NTL data is preprocessed by inter-calibration using methods proposed by followed by normalization. Then NTL training datasets and validation datasets are generated by randomly cropping and spatially splitting. Step 2: A nighttime light convolutional long short-term memory network (NTLSTM) is developed to model the inherent mechanism of dynamic changes of NTL datasets. Step 3: We utilize several assessment criteria for evaluating the performance of the proposed model in validation datasets. Step 4: The simulated NTL images of China (1984-2020) are generated using our properly trained NTLSTM. Step 5: The generated NTL data is temporally adjusted into a more consistent version of PANDA-China using MODEST (an adapted RLOWESS method)."
