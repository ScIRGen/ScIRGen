            "titleEn": "Geochemical data of Uranium deposits in South China (Since 200 Ma)",
            "description": "This data set comes from four published academic papers.\nPaper 1: La – ICP – MS was used to analyze the REE composition of uranium mineral particles in different metallogenic ages of Xianshi uranium deposit in South China. Based on the data obtained, it can be seen that the REE distribution characteristics of the three groups of uranium minerals are similar. However, the contents of rare earth elements in uranium minerals in different metallogenic stages are obviously different, even several orders of magnitude, such as La, EU, Dy, Yb and Lu. It is worth noting that most of the REE patterns of these uranium minerals show slight positive EU anomalies. The REE patterns of Xianshi uranium minerals are different from those of the surrounding rocks of the Zhudong granite, diabase in Xianshi uranium deposit and pitchblende related to granite type uranium deposits, and are also different from those of other types of uranium deposits. Combined with the author's previous research results, we propose that the uranium mineral in Xianshi uranium deposit may not be the uranium oxide (e.g., UO2 or u3o7) generally considered by predecessors. Therefore, the REE characteristics of Xianshi uranium mineral further support that it may be a new uranium mineral, vorlanite.\nThesis 2: by optimizing the Sims U-Pb dating process of young uranium minerals and improving the high common Pb data processing method, this paper further expands the application scope of SIMS U-Pb dating of uranium minerals; The Sims U-Pb age of uranium mineral in menggongjie granite type uranium deposit in northern Guangxi is 1.9 by using Sims U-Pb dating technique combined with traditional U-Th-Pb chemical age method ±  The U-Th-Pb chemical age of uranium mineral is 2.3 ±  The mineralization events of the deposit are almost simultaneous with the emplacement process of volcanic rocks (2.1 – 1.2 MA) in the Quaternary extensional setting of South China; It is the youngest uranium mineralization event in South China.\nPaper 3: This paper systematically reviews and analyzes the development process of uranium mineralization dating methods, and reviews five main methods of uranium mineral dating: (1) u-th-totalpb chemical age of uranium minerals（ 2) Model age of uranium minerals（ 3) Traditional isochron age of uranium minerals（ 4) The age of associated minerals of uranium minerals（ 5) U-Pb age of uranium minerals in situ micro area; The existing problems and corresponding schemes in the study of uranium mineralization dating are discussed in depth, which is expected to promote the development of metallogenic geochronology of uranium deposits in the future.\nPaper 4: the age of two groups of NWW trending basic dikes and one group of nee trending basic dikes obtained by amphibole ar AR method in Xiazhuang is 200-180 ma. The age of these basic dikes is consistent with the zircon U-Pb age of Xiazhuang basic dikes within the error range, which further confirms the existence of Early Jurassic basic magmatism in Xiazhuang area, northern Guangdong Province. Although the age of uranium mineralization has not been reported yet, the existence of these early basic dikes is of great geological significance to the understanding of uranium mineralization and regional tectonic evolution. It indicates that South China is in extensional tectonic geological setting at the moment, indicating that lithospheric extension in South China may have started at least 200-190 Ma after Indosinian collision orogeny.\nNote 1: GPS coordinates of menggongjie uranium deposit: n26 ° 11′ ，E110 ° 30′。\nNote 2: GPS coordinates of Xiazhuang uranium mine: n24 ° 33′，E114 ° 14′。",

                    "Answer": "LA–ICP–MS is significant for analyzing rare earth element composition in uranium minerals as it allows for detailed examination of the elemental distribution and concentration within different mineralization stages. This method can reveal variations in rare earth elements such as La, Eu, Dy, Yb, and Lu, which may indicate different formation processes or conditions, supporting the identification of potential new uranium minerals like high-uranium calcium (Vorlanite) in the context of the Sian Stone uranium deposit.",

                    "Answer": "The LA–ICP–MS method is used to analyze the rare earth element composition of uranium minerals, focusing on their distribution and concentration differences across mineralization stages. This method helps identify unique REEs patterns, suggesting potential new uranium minerals. In contrast, SIMS U-Pb dating is applied for determining the age of uranium minerals, with improvements in handling common Pb data and extending dating applicability. While LA–ICP–MS provides insights into the geochemical characteristics and mineral identity, SIMS U-Pb dating offers precise age determination, aiding in understanding the timing of mineralization events.",

                    "Answer": "The variation in REE distribution patterns among different uraniferous mineralization stages could suggest that different geochemical processes were involved in the formation of uranium deposits in South China. The similar distribution patterns of REEs across different mineralization stages, despite significant differences in content, might indicate that while similar sources or processes may have been involved, the conditions or the extent of the processes varied significantly. The presence of a Eu positive anomaly and differences with surrounding rock types and other uranium deposits suggest unique geochemical conditions or post-formational processes influencing the REE characteristics. Additionally, the identification of potentially new uranium minerals like Vorlanite suggests the presence of previously unrecognized geochemical processes or conditions during mineral formation.",

                    "Answer": "The variability in REE distribution patterns in uranium minerals from different mineralization stages in the South China uranium deposits is influenced by the mineralization age and the type of uranium minerals present. For example, variations in elements like La, Eu, Dy, Yb, and Lu can differ by several orders of magnitude between stages. Additionally, the REE distribution patterns exhibit distinct differences compared to those in surrounding rocks such as Sondong granite and diabase, suggesting unique geochemical processes at play during formation. The presence of a potential new uranium mineral, high uranium calcium (Vorlanite), further supports these distinctions.",

                    "Answer": "Developing a systematic approach to date uranium mineralization events using various U-Pb dating techniques is important because it allows researchers to accurately determine the ages of uranium deposits. This can facilitate the understanding of the timing and processes of mineralization events, especially in complex geological settings like those in South China. By using different dating methods, researchers can cross-verify ages and improve the reliability of age determinations, which is crucial for reconstructing the geodynamic history and metallogenic evolution of a region. Such approaches also help in identifying the youngest uranium mineralization events and their association with geological activities like volcanic intrusions under specific tectonic settings.",

                    "Answer": "The analysis of uranium mineral age using the SIMS U-Pb dating technique involves optimizing the SIMS U-Pb dating process and improving high common Pb data processing methods. This ensures the accuracy of the dating by expanding its applicability, as demonstrated by obtaining consistent age results with the U-Th-Pb chemical age method in granite-hosted uranium minerals. Addressing high common Pb content challenges includes using specific calibration procedures and data correction techniques to minimize errors and achieve reliable age determinations.",
