            "description": "This data integrates a variety of current natural geographic map data, and combines land suitability evaluation, crop growth model, scenario analysis and other methods to generate China's biomass resources and energy technology potential on a 1km grid scale from 2015 to 2100, with a temporal resolution of 5 years and a spatial resolution of 1km. The data set includes 3 categories and 11 types of biomass resources (the residues include dry land agricultural residues, paddy field agricultural residues, forest residues, shrub residues, orchard residues and grassland residues, the wastes include livestock manure, MSW and COD, and the energy crops include sweet sorghum and switchgrass), fully covering the types of biomass that can be used as resources. The data format is raster data (. tiff), which can be opened using ArcGIS, R/Python and other programming languages.\nBiomass is a dependent resource for negative carbon technology in China's carbon neutral technology system in the future. The biomass data developed in this research has three advantages: wide coverage (nationwide), fine spatial resolution (1km grid), and wide time span (2015-2100). It can provide detailed quantitative data for China to formulate low-carbon emission reduction strategies and deploy biomass energy technology strategies.",

As a substitute for coal, oil, and natural gas, bioenergy can reduce carbon emissions that are difficult to reduce, for example in transportation, or even result in negative emissions coupled with carbon capture and storage. Compared to other sources of bioenergy, energy crops are not only suitable for large-scale and commercial applications but also can be the main source of newly added biofuels in the coming years. The development of energy crops in the future is determined by critical factors such as environmental conditions, land use policy, and climate change. Yield per hectare and land use are two direct factors that determine the potential and distribution of energy crops."
