            "description": "This data is the major and trace zircon U-Pb ages and whole rock SR nd Pb isotopic data of granodiorite and monzodiorite in the Tethys ocean belt, western Pakistan. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, the zircon U-Pb dating data were obtained by LA-ICP-MS analysis, and the whole rock SR nd Pb isotope data were obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can restrict the origin of granodiorite and monzodiorite, magmatism and their relationship with copper and gold mineralization in the Tethys ocean belt, western Pakistan.",
