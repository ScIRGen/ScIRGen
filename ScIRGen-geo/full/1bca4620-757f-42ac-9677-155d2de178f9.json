                "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a family of noncoding RNAs that are greater than 200 nucleotides in length and lack long or conserved ORFs, were formerly regarded as “junk RNAs.” Recently, however, a growing amount of evidence has demonstrated that many short or small ORFs (smORFs) embedded in lncRNA transcripts are able to encode functional polypeptides (smORFs-encoded polypeptides [SEPs]). These SEPs contain less than 100 amino acids in eukaryotes (50 amino acids in prokaryotes) and play vital regulatory roles in diverse physiological processes, including cancer growth, mucosal immunity, and fatty acid β-oxidation. These findings have subverted our understanding of lncRNAs and expanded our knowledge of the coding potential of the genome. Moreover, the development of genomics and bioinformatics, in particular the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology, accelerated the discovery of thousands of additional lncRNA transcripts with smORFs. Considering such large numbers of lncRNAs and smORFs, it is expected that SEPs may represent a large albeit neglected portion of nonannotated peptides involved in diverse physiological processes. A variety of different methodologies, such as smORF predictions by computational sequence analysis, deep sequencing–based ribosome profiling, and MS-based proteomics, have been developed for the identification and characterization of SEPs across different biological samples. However, each of these strategies presents caveats."

Even though multiple methods are available to enrich SEPs from different biological samples by fractionating or removing highly abundant and large proteins to reduce sample complexity, the various physical and chemical properties of different SEPs are often overlooked by different methods, which may negatively bias their discovery."
