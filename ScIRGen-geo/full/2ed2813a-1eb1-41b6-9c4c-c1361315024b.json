Biomass observation included fresh and dry aboveground biomass, fresh and dry underground biomass (fresh and dry root weight), vegetation coverage was observed by digital camera, leaf area index was observed by LAI 2200, and plant height was observed by tape measure. The observation period was from May 26 to September 26, 2018, in which LAI started from May 30. Observation parameters were observed every 5 days before July 31 and every 10 days thereafter, and a total of 22 observations (LAI was 20) were carried out during the whole growing period. The dataset can provide data basis for inversion and validation of surface vegetation parameters.",

                "Crop biomass is one of the most important biophysical indicators of crop growth. The accurate and efficient estimation of the regional crop biomass at different growth stages is of great importance in guiding crop management decision making, such as in effective fertilization, water irrigation, weeding, and pest and disease management. In addition, as an important aspect of biomass energy, the accurate estimation of crop biomass contributes to the rational and effective utilization of biomass energy. Moreover, effective estimates of crop biomass during the growing season could play a key role in crop yield prediction. The traditional crop biomass estimation method is mainly based on field measurements, which include destructive field sampling, laboratory drying and weighting. The traditional methods are relatively accurate, but they are labor intensive and time consuming. Moreover, the sparse nature of space makes it impossible to provide a comprehensive understanding at regional or larger scales. Thus, it is impossible to acquire the regional crop biomass via ground measurements alone. The satellite remote sensing technique is a unique and useful method for crop biomass monitoring in a repeatable manner due to the valuable information it provides on vegetation parameters, high spatial coverage and long time series, which effectively compensates for the deficiency of traditional biomass estimation methods. Previous studies have revealed that remote sensing is a reliable and effective technique to obtain biophysical and biochemical crop information."

                "In this study, the corn biomass was estimated based on daily MODIS datasets with a 500 m spatial resolution combined with long-term ground observation data in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, and four machine learning algorithms, namely RF, SVM, ANN, and XGBoost, were adopted to predict the biomass. Large, relatively homogeneous areas, which mainly functioned as corn growing areas, were selected as the sample sites. According to a field survey of the sample sites, a total of sixteen sites were selected in 2012, and three sites were selected for field measurement purposes every year from 2013 to 2019. One to three plots for each sample site were chosen for further biomass observation, with each plot covering an area of 100 m ×100 m. All selected plants in each plot were collected, and the roots of the corn plants were washed. The fresh weight was measured, after which the plants were transported to the laboratory, chopped into easy-to-dry segments, and dried in an oven at 85°C for 48–72 h until a constant dry biomass was obtained. MODIS MCD43A4 and MOD15A2 products from May to September from 2012 to 2019 were analyzed in this study. The forward feature selection method was implemented to choose the most influential variables, which is an iterative method starting from the condition of no model features. In each iteration, we add a given feature that best improves the model until the addition of a new variable does not further improve the model performance. The RF, SVM, ANN, and XGBoost algorithms were adopted in this study. R software was used to implement the above four machine learning algorithms with the randomForest, kernlab, brnn, and xgboost packages. In this study, the caret package in R software was applied to tune the parameters of the above four machine learning algorithms. The 10-fold cross validation method was implemented to evaluate the performance of the above four machine learning models due to the small number of training samples."
