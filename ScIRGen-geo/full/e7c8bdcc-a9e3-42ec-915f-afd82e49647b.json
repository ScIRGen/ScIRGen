                    "Answer": "The selection of LA-ICPMS, SHRIMP, and ID TIMS as data collection methods for determining zircon U-Pb ages in granites of the southern Qiangtang terrane is primarily due to their ability to provide precise and accurate isotopic age data. These methods are well-suited for geological samples and meet laboratory standards for data quality, ensuring reliable results. Additionally, these techniques are widely accepted in the scientific community for such analyses, allowing for consistency and comparability with previously published studies.",
