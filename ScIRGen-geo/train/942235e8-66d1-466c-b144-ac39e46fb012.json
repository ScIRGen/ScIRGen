Global land cover data plays an important role on the various research studies of global change, ecosystem assessment and environmental modeling. In recent years, a number of global land cover datasets have been produced, including IGBP DISCover land cover dataset, UMD land cover dataset, GLC-2000 land cover dataset, MODIS land cover dataset (MCD12Q1) and MERIS Globcover land cover dataset. However those datasets are derived from different data sources, based on different classification systems, employing different methodologies and at different spatial resolutions.
