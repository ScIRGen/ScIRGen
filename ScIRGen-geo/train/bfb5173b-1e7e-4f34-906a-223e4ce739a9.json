            "description": "The dataset of snow properties measured by the Snowfork was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental area from Dec. 5-16 2007, during the pre-observation period. The aims of the measurements were to verify applicability of the instruments and to acquire snow parameters for simultaneous airborne, satellite-borne and ground-based remote sensing experiments and other control experiments.\n     Observation items included:\n     (1) physical quantities by direct observations: resonant frequency, the rate of attenuation and 3db bandwidth\n     (2) physical quantities by indirect observations: snow density, snow complex permittivity (the real part and the imaginary part), snow volumetric moisture and snow gravimetric moisture.\n     Five files including raw data and processed data are kept, data by the Snowfork on Dec 5, data by BG-A MODIS on Dec 6 and 7, data in BG-B, BG-C, BG-D and BG-E on Dec 10, and data in BG-D with the microwave radiometer on Dec 14 and 16.",
