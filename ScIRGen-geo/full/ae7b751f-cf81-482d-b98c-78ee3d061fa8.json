            "description": "This data includes whole rock major and trace geochemical data, major and trace element data of spodumene, major element data of lithium permeable feldspar and niobium iron group minerals, and radioisotope dating data of niobium iron group minerals and cassiterite. The samples were collected from the pushla leucogranite in central Tibet. The whole rock principal geochemical data are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, trace elements are obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, mineral principal element data are obtained by electron probe analysis, mineral trace element data and radioisotope dating of niobium iron group minerals and cassiterite are obtained by laser denudation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Based on the obtained data, the lithium metallogenic characteristics of pushla leucogranite can be determined, which occurs in Spodumene (- lithium permeable feldspar) pegmatite; In addition, the data can define the formation age of lithium metallogenic pegmatite as Miocene (~ 25 – 23 MA).",

                    "Answer": "In the context of geochemical data collection, 'X-ray fluorescence spectrometry' refers to a technique used to obtain major elemental data from whole rock samples. It involves analyzing the rock samples to determine their chemical composition by detecting the fluorescent X-rays emitted from the sample when it is excited by a primary X-ray source.",

                    "Answer": "Researchers select specific geochemical analysis methods like X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry because they provide precise measurements of major and trace elements, which are crucial for understanding the geochemical characteristics and mineralization processes of granitic and pegmatitic formations, such as those in the Tibetan region. These methods are chosen for their ability to accurately assess the mineral composition and isotopic dating necessary to determine the age and formation processes of these geological features.",

This information helps in assessing the potential for lithium deposits, specifically in the context of the Pusila leucogranite body in central Tibet, where such data can reveal the mineralization features and formation period during the Miocene (~25–23 Ma).",

                    "Answer": "Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is used to analyze mineral trace elements and perform isotopic dating on niobium-tantalum minerals and cassiterite. This involves ablating the sample with a laser to create a fine aerosol, which is then transported into the plasma of the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method allows for precise measurement of trace elements and isotopic ratios, which helps in determining the age and composition of the minerals associated with the lithium-bearing pegmatites found in the light-colored granite body of central Tibet.",
