        "The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model was successfully applied to estimate evaporation (E), transpiration (T), and evapotranspiration (ET) for land covered with vegetation, which has significantly important applications for the terrestrial water cycle and water resource management. One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
        "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
        "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

The soil and canopy component temperatures were calculated using the images obtained with the thermal camera. To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities.

They also support the development of models and strategies for sustainable oasis development and ecological security, offering a quantitative basis for recognizing oasis–desert interactions.",

        "QuestionCn": "我不确定如何将遥感的气象数据与地面观测相结合进行综合分析。",
        "AnswerEn": "The integration can be achieved by using models like the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model, which employs ground-measured soil and canopy component temperatures to estimate evaporation, transpiration, and evapotranspiration. Ground-based data, such as those from eddy covariance systems and meteorological parameters measured at fixed intervals, supplement the remote sensing data to provide a more comprehensive analysis.",
        "AnswerCn": "集成可以通过使用双源能量平衡（TSEB）模型来实现，该模型利用地面测量的土壤和冠层组分温度来估算蒸发、蒸腾和蒸散。地面数据，如涡度协方差系统的数据和固定间隔测量的气象参数，补充了遥感数据，以提供更全面的分析。",

        "AnswerEn": "The data management and quality control process involves ensuring a consistent number of data points per day, removing duplicates, and filtering out data that exceed physical or instrumental thresholds. Observational datasets are collected from various stations, and data processing includes steps such as data collection, processing, and archiving, with sharing procedures in place to maintain data integrity over long periods.",

        "AnswerEn": "In hydrometeorological networks, such as those monitoring the Heihe River Basin, sensors are strategically placed to capture accurate atmospheric and soil data. For instance, air temperature and relative humidity sensors are positioned at a height of 28 meters, facing north, to minimize interference from surrounding vegetation and structures. Wind speed sensors are also placed at the same height and orientation. Radiation instruments are set at varying heights (6m and 24m) and orientations to capture comprehensive solar and thermal data. Soil temperature and moisture sensors are embedded at different depths and distances from the meteorological tower to ensure accurate ground-level readings. Such careful sensor positioning and orientation are crucial for minimizing data inaccuracies due to environmental obstructions and ensuring the integrity of the dataset for further analysis and application.",
        "AnswerCn": "在水文气象网络中，例如监测黑河流域的网络，传感器被战略性地放置，以捕捉准确的大气和土壤数据。例如，空气温度和相对湿度传感器被放置在28米的高度，朝北方向，以最小化周围植被和结构的干扰。风速传感器也被放置在相同的高度和方向。辐射仪器则设置在不同的高度（6米和24米）和方向，以捕捉全面的太阳和热量数据。土壤温度和湿度传感器嵌入在不同的深度和距离气象塔的位置，以确保准确的地面读数。这种精心的传感器定位和方向设置对于最小化由于环境障碍造成的数据不准确性至关重要，并确保数据集的完整性，以便进行进一步的分析和应用。",
