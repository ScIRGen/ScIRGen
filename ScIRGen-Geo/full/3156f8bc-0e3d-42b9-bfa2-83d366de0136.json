The variables available are average minimum temperature (°C), average maximum temperature (°C) and total precipitation (mm).

                "Spatially interpolated gridded climate data, here referred to as 'climate surfaces', are used in many areas of work, particularly in the environmental, agricultural and biological sciences. For many applications, data at a high (≤1km2) spatial resolution are preferred to capture environmental variation that can be lost at lower spatial resolutions, particularly in mountainous and other areas with steep climate gradients. Hijmans et al. (2005) provided climate surfaces, referred to as the ‘WorldClim version 1 database’, for global land areas (excluding Antarctica), consisting of long-term average monthly temperature and precipitation. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of climate stations for which data is available, including a number of stations located at high latitudes and elevations. Furthermore, while the original dataset was limited to monthly precipitation and temperature, we also included solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure, which may be necessary to model important processes such as plant growth. Estimates for regions where weather station density (or quality) is insufficient to resolve local gradients may be improved using remotely sensed meteorological data from satellites."

Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. We compiled monthly average climate data for weather stations from a large number of global, regional, national, and local sources, mostly for the 1970–2000 period. Utilizing satellite-derived data and other covariables, we interpolated these data using the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in ANUSPLIN and created global climate surfaces for monthly precipitation and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and vapour pressure. Final surfaces were created by selecting only the model with the lowest cross-validation RMSE value for each region, fit to the full dataset."

                "AnswerEn": "Including additional climate variables such as solar radiation and wind speed is necessary for modeling environmental processes like plant growth, which are influenced by a comprehensive range of meteorological conditions. These variables provide a more complete picture of the climate and can improve the accuracy of models that rely on understanding how temperature, precipitation, and other factors interact in various ecological and agricultural contexts.",

Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Utilizing satellite-derived data and other covariables, the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in ANUSPLIN was used to create global climate surfaces for monthly precipitation and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and vapour pressure.",
