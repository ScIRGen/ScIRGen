            "description": "In the lower reaches of Tarim River, groundwater is the only water source to maintain the survival of natural vegetation.  The change of groundwater level directly affects the growth and decline of plants and controls the evolution and composition of plant communities.  Strengthening the research on chemical characteristics of groundwater is an important content of water resources quality evaluation, which is of great significance to the utilization mode, sustainable development, management and protection and construction of ecological environment of watershed water resources.\nGroundwater level data: In order to understand the change of groundwater level in the process of water conveyance in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, nine groundwater monitoring sections (Figure 1) have been established along the water conveyance channel of the lower reaches of the Tarim River-Qiwenkuoer River. Each section has a spacing of about 20 km. Below Daxi Haizi Reservoir, there are 9 sections such as Akdun (A), Yahefu Mahan (B), Yingsu (C), Abodah Le (D), Khaldayi (E), Tuguemaile (F) and Arakan (G), Yigan Buma (H) and Kaogan (1).  Among them, the spacing of the last three sections is 45 km.  In the horizontal direction, one underground water level monitoring well (well depth 8-17 m) is arranged at intervals of 100 m or 200 m in each section, and a total of 40 underground water monitoring wells are arranged to monitor the underground water level, water and salt dynamic changes and the influence range on the underground water level in each section during the water delivery process to the lower reaches of Tarim River.  The monitoring frequency is once a month, and the monitoring frequency is increased during the water delivery process.  Groundwater level data are monitored by conductivity method.\nObservation sections include:\n1. Akerdun Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River\n2. Yahefu Mahan Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River\n3. Yingsu Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River\n4. Abodah-Le Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River\n5. Karadayi Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River\n6. Tuguemaile Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River\n7. Arakan Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River\n8. The lower reaches of Tarim River are not as good as the Ma section\n9. Kaogan Section in Lower Reaches of Tarim River",

The fluctuation of groundwater levels directly impacts plant growth and decline, influencing the evolution and composition of plant communities. During water transport processes, monitoring is essential to assess the dynamic changes in groundwater levels and salinity, which affect the groundwater level's influence range. Therefore, increased monitoring frequency is necessary to capture these variations accurately.",

The data collected directly influences the growth and decline of plants, controlling the evolution and composition of plant communities.
