            "description": "The evaluation area of the data set is the central urban area of Yangon deepwater port. The data set is based on the extreme precipitation disaster risk spatial distribution data set (2019) and its evaluation index system. The data set considers both precipitation risk and terrain risk. Among them, precipitation risk index includes extreme precipitation intensity index and extreme precipitation frequency index, both of which are obtained from GPM precipitation data. Terrain risk mainly considers elevation index. Finally, the risk assessment results of extreme precipitation disaster are obtained. The probability and intensity of extreme precipitation disaster in high risk area are higher than those in low risk area.",

                    "Answer": "Extreme precipitation hazard risk assessment refers to the process of evaluating areas based on the potential and intensity of extreme precipitation events and their associated risks. It involves analyzing various indicators such as extreme precipitation intensity and frequency derived from GPM precipitation data, as well as topographical factors like elevation, to determine regions that are more susceptible to extreme precipitation hazards. Areas with higher risk are more likely to experience severe impacts from such events.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of GPM precipitation data with elevation indicators allows for a comprehensive evaluation of extreme precipitation hazards by combining both precipitation risk and topographical risk factors. Precipitation risk is assessed using extreme precipitation intensity and frequency indicators derived from GPM data, while topographical risk considers elevation indicators. This approach provides a nuanced understanding of hazard distribution, highlighting areas with higher potential for extreme precipitation events and their intensity, compared to areas with lower risk.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution of extreme precipitation hazard risk is influenced by factors such as precipitation hazard indicators and terrain hazard indicators. Precipitation hazard indicators include extreme precipitation intensity and frequency, which are extracted from GPM precipitation data. Terrain hazard is primarily determined by elevation. These factors guide data collection methods by focusing on precise precipitation measurements and topographic assessments to evaluate areas with higher risk of extreme precipitation disasters.",

                    "Answer": "By integrating both rainfall intensity and frequency indicators alongside topographic risk indicators, the spatial distribution of extreme rainfall hazard risk can be more accurately assessed. This comprehensive approach allows for a nuanced understanding of how varying levels of rainfall and differing topographical features contribute to the overall hazard risk. As a result, areas identified as high-risk are more likely to experience both a higher probability and greater intensity of extreme rainfall hazards compared to low-risk areas.",

Precipitation risk indicators include extreme precipitation intensity and frequency, derived from GPM precipitation data, while terrain risk focuses on elevation. The aim is to identify high-risk areas where the likelihood and intensity of extreme precipitation disasters are greater, thus facilitating better risk management and mitigation strategies in the region.",

These indicators are then statistically extracted and evaluated. Additionally, topographic risk factors such as elevation are considered to provide a comprehensive assessment of hazard risk. The final output is a spatial distribution of extreme precipitation hazard risk, highlighting areas with higher potential for severe impacts.",
