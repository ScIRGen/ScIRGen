            "description": "Canadian forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle. In recent decades, there has been significant uncertainty in the carbon sequestration capacity of Canadian forests due to events such as global warming, forest disturbance, and forest degradation. Based on the low-frequency passive microwave vegetation optical thickness (L-VOD) interannual product independently developed by the team, the aboveground carbon storage of Canadian forests from 2016 to 2021 was estimated, and the interannual variation of Canadian forest carbon storage was further analyzed. The results showed that the net change in aboveground carbon storage in Canadian forests from 2016 to 2021 was 28.49 Tg C yr-1, which was composed of a total increase of 219.34 Tg C yr-1 and a total loss of 190.86 Tg C yr-1. This product is of great significance for monitoring the spatial distribution characteristics and temporal trends of Canadian forest carbon sinks/sources, and understanding their position in the global carbon cycle.",

It contrasts with traditional field surveys that rely on direct measurements and remote sensing techniques that may focus on different spectral ranges and temporal resolutions. L-VOD specifically enables the quantification of carbon stock changes in the context of global warming, forest disturbances, and degradation, providing insights into the net changes in carbon stocks and the spatial distribution and temporal trends of carbon sinks and sources in Canadian forests.",

These events affect the carbon sink potential of forests, contributing to the variability in carbon storage estimates. The analysis of carbon storage trends from 2016 to 2021 using low-frequency passive microwave vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) products highlights these uncertainties and their implications for understanding the role of Canadian forests in the global carbon cycle.",
