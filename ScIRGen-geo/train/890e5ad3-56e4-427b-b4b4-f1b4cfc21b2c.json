            "description": "This dataset contains the glacier outlines in Qilian Mountain Area from 1980 to 2015. The dataset was produced based on classical band ratio criterion and manual editing. Landsat images collected between 1978 and 2018 were used as basic data for glacier extraction. Google images and Map World images were employed as reference data for manual adjusting. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates, glacier ID and glacier area. Consisting of 8 seasons, the dataset has a temporal resolution of 5 years and a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±30 meter). The dataset directly reflects the variation of glacier distribution within the Qilian Mountain in the past 35 years, and can be used for quantitative estimation of glacier mass balance and the quantitative assessment of glacier change’s impact on basin runoff.",

This approach combines automated spectral analysis with manual adjustments, which can enhance accuracy by addressing errors that automated methods alone may miss. It provides a time resolution of 5 years over a 35-year period, offering detailed insights into glacier distribution changes. The inclusion of reference data from Google and Tianditu imagery supports the validation and refinement of the extracted boundaries, potentially offering a balance between automated efficiency and manual accuracy.",
