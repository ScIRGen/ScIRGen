The Leucogranites are from saga, Cuona and zhengga areas in southern Tibet; Mo isotope analysis data were determined by multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC – ICP – MS), and the standard sample and leucogranite data were obtained to verify the accuracy and accuracy of the established analysis method for low Mo content samples, so as to achieve high-precision Mo isotope analysis for more low content samples.",
