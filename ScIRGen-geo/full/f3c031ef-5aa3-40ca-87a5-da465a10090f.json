            "description": "The data generated by the project are as follows:\n1、 \t Zircon U-Pb age, Hf isotope and trace element data produced by third-party detection;\n2、 \t Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic geochemical data of the whole rock generated by third-party detection;\n3、 \t Whole rock major and trace element data generated through third-party detection;\n4、 \t In situ major and trace element data of chlorite and epidote produced by third-party detection;\n5、 \t Mineral EPMA data generated by third-party detection;\n6、 \t Measured short-wave infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence element data in the field;\n7、 \t Measured audio magnetotelluric data and broadband magnetotelluric data in the field;\nThe above data were collected in the middle Gangdese metallogenic belt, Tibet. The geophysical data include audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) array covering the major porphyry Cu-deposits and the regional broad-band magnetotelluric (BBMT) array within Zhunuo mining area and surrounding areas, and also the three-dimensional electrical structure models obtained by the inversion of these data. These data were collected from July to October 2019. The magnetotelluric soundings (MT) use the natural electromagnetic fields with rich frequency components as the field source and are able to detect the electrical structure of the earth from near surface to hundreds of kilometers underground. Both the AMT and BBMT data were collected in accordance with the technical specification for natural field audio-magnetotelluric methods (No. DZT 0305-2017). They data acquisition works were conducted through Mtu-5A system developed by the Phoenix Co., Ltd., Canada. The collecting time for BBMT data were more than 24 hours and with period range of 0.004~3000s, while the values of AMT data were more than 1 h and 10000Hz~1s, respectively. The field stations were deployed in geographical coordinates. Standard robust estimation and remote reference processing were used to process the time series and reduce the effects of cultural noises, and finally the impedance tensors and the corresponding apparent resistivity, phase and other information were obtained after editing. Before inversion, the AMT and BBMT impedance data need to be analyzed in detail for dimensionality and strike information. Error floors of 7.5-10 per-cent of the absolute values of both the unrotated diagonal and off-diagonal impedances (i.e., Zxx & Zyy and Zxy & Zyx components) were applied for the 3-D inversion.\nThe short wave infrared spectrum and X-ray fluorescence elemental analysis data are collected from Beimulang and Cimabanshuo deposits in the Zhunuo ore concentration area. The infrared spectrum data were obtained by TerraSpec® Halo of American ASD company that is full spectral range infrared mineral analyzer. The X-ray fluorescence data were obtained by the new generation NITON xl3t 950 portable XRF element analyzer of Thermo Scientific NITON. The collection time is 2018-2021.\nThe chlorite, epidote and rock mass samples for integrated study are all collected from Beimlang, Cimabanshuo, Rmujucuo, Luobugangmu, Yawajiage and other deposits in the middle Gangdese. The trace element data of chlorite and epidote, whole rock major and trace element data and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data, zircon U-Pb dating and trace element data, zircon Hf isotopic data and mineral electron microprobe data for comprehensive study were completed in laboratories with relevant qualifications at home and abroad, mainly including the Centre for Ore Deposits and Earth Sciences (CODES), University of Tasmania, Australia, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Analytical Laboratory of Beijing Research Institute of Uranium Geology, Geological Experiment and testing center, Hubei, Wuhan SampleSolution Analytical Technology Co., Ltd, and Beijing Createch Testing Technology Co., Ltd. All the data have reliable quality. The instruments used include AnalytikJena PQMS Elite ICP-MS instrument with a RESOlution 193 nm laser ablation system, laser ablation multi receiver cup plasma mass spectrometer (LA-MC-ICP-MS), X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, ICP-MS, multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICPMS), ISOPROBE-T thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) and EPMA-1600. The collection time is 2018-2021.\nThe data set of deep prediction evaluation and prospecting demonstration of porphyry mineralization system in the middle Gangdese provides data support for researchers to study the genetic mechanism and exploration model of the porphyry copper deposit in the Gangdese belt, which show a good application prospect in guiding the prospecting breakthrough in the middle Gangdese.",

                "The Cima Ban copper deposit is a newly discovered porphyry copper deposit in the western segment of the Gangdise Range, located about 10 km southwest of the Juno super-large porphyry copper deposit. Surrounding it are deposits such as Beimu Lang, Luobugangmu, and Dongshibu, making it an important part of the Juno copper polymetallic mineral district. The Gangdise copper belt in Tibet is located on the north bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, extending approximately 600 km from Gongbu Jiangda County in the east to Angren County in the west, with a width of about 120 km, covering an area of approximately 72,000 km². It hosts multiple porphyry and skarn-type deposits. The mainstream view suggests that the eastern segment of the Gangdise copper belt is an area of steep subduction of the Indian continent, where the geothermal gradient varies greatly, facilitating the dehydration and replacement of hydrous minerals in the lower crust, which is conducive to the formation of porphyry copper deposits. In contrast, the western segment experiences gentle subduction with a smaller variation in geothermal gradient, making it less favorable for the dehydration of hydrous minerals, particularly muscovite, which is the reason for the relative lack of porphyry copper deposits in the western segment of Gangdise. The oxygen fugacity and water content of the magma are important influencing factors in controlling the formation of porphyry copper deposits."

Among them, F porphyry provides the main Cu mineralization for the Zima Banshu deposit and is the primary mineralizing rock body. The Zima Banshu copper deposit exhibits at least three phases of hydrothermal fluid exsolution processes (diorite porphyry, monzogranite, and deep concealed rock bodies). The alteration-mineralization zoning is not significant, but various alterations are strongly superimposed, forming a complex multi-phase hydrothermal-mineralization system. The Cu precipitation in Zima Banshu occurs throughout the hydrothermal mineralization process, mainly precipitating during the potassic silicate alteration stage, with some Cu precipitating during the greisenization stage, and a small amount during the sericitization stage. The zircon trace element characteristic indicators of the Miocene rock body in Zima Banshu, Ce4+/Ce3+ and 10000×(Eu/Eu*)/(Y-(Ce/Nd))/Y, are higher than those of the Juno mineralizing rock body, indicating a greater mineralization potential for Zima Banshu."

Finally, the metallic elements precipitate in the form of metal sulfides. Upon cooling down, they react with the wall rock to cause the chalcopyrite and molybdenite precipitating within quartz veins and being disseminated in potassic-altered rocks."
