            "description": "This dataset includes the content of target proteins, gene expression levels, enzyme activities of citrate synthase and OGDH, as well as immunoprecipitation (IP) measurements and molecular interactions, derived from proteomics and bioinformatics obtained from the construction of CS and AS animal models in New Zealand white rabbits. The distribution of genes, differentially expressed genes, and major enrichment pathways between different groups were analyzed using R.studio software. Data were analyzed using LIMMA package, WGCNA package, ggplot2 package, etc. Two of the most important hub proteins related to CS and AS (citrate synthase and OGDH) were identified in the adrenal gland. Hub proteins are mainly enriched in mitochondrial proton transport ATP synthase complexes, ATPase activation, and AMPK signaling pathways. Compared with the control group, the AS+CS group had a larger adrenal gland, which was more disordered, irregular, and necrotic. At the protein and mRNA levels, the expression of citrate synthase and OGDH in the AS+CS group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). Through Spearman's rho analysis, subject working characteristic curves, neural network models, and cubic spline interpolation, there is a strong correlation (P<0.05) between the cross-sectional areas of adrenal gland, citrate synthase, and OGDH. Under atherosclerosis and chronic stress, the activities of citrate synthase and OGDH increased. Through CCK8 assay, adrenal cell viability was significantly downregulated after knockdown experiments on citrate synthase and OGDH. The target gene TF-miRNA regulatory network reveals a close interrelationship between predicted microRNAs, citrate synthase, and OGDH. After immunoprecipitation (IP) assay, the results showed that citrate synthase and OGDH were co expressed in the adrenal gland. Molecular docking studies have shown that the docking score for the optimal composite conformation of citrate synthase and OGDH is -6.15 kcal/mol.",

                    "Answer": "The observed increase in enzyme activity of citrate synthase and OGDH suggests that these enzymes may play a critical role in the mitochondrial proton transport ATP synthase complex, ATPase activation, and AMPK signaling pathways. This indicates that under stress and atherosclerosis, there might be heightened energy demands or metabolic shifts in the adrenal gland, which could be regulated through these pathways. Additionally, the strong correlation between adrenal gland size, enzyme levels, and gene expression points towards a systemic response to stress that could be mediated by changes in mitochondrial activity and energy metabolism.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of chronic stress and atherosclerosis, the enzyme activity of citrate synthase and OGDH may vary due to differences in protein expression levels and gene expression. The study indicates that these enzymes' activities increase under such conditions, which could be due to their significant correlation with adrenal size, disorder, and necrosis. Additionally, the interaction between citrate synthase and OGDH, as suggested by molecular docking studies, could influence these variations. Furthermore, regulatory networks involving target genes, transcription factors, and microRNAs might also contribute to the differences observed in enzyme activities.",

The study aims to understand the distribution of genes, differential expression, and enrichment pathways using software and packages like R.studio, limma, WGCNA, and ggplot2.
