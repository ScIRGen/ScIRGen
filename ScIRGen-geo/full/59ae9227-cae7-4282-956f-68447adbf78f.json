            "description": "The main and micro test analysis of Lianyunshan rock mass was completed in Beijing Institute of geology of nuclear industry in 2019. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) was used to determine the major elements. The process was as follows: first, 0.7G sample was weighed, and then boric acid was added to melt into glass at high temperature. Finally, the oxide content was determined by XRF (Philips pw2404 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer). The accuracy of major element analysis is better than 5% under the monitoring of gsr-1 (granite) standard sample. The determination of trace elements was carried out by ICP-MS: firstly, 50 mg sample was weighed and decomposed by hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid open container digestion method and hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid closed container digestion method, and the solution was made. Then, the internal standard method was used for determination on ICP-MS, and the analysis accuracy was better than 10%.",
