            "description": "Soil moisture (SM) plays a vital role in regulating the water and energy exchange between land surfaces and the atmosphere and is declared an essential climate variable by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a crucial parameter describing vegetation attenuation properties in microwave radiative transfer equation, and it has been proven to be a promising ecological indicator for studying plant hydraulics, carbon stocks, and vegetation phenology.\nA long-term SM and polarization-, frequency-dependent VODs (C/X/Ku) product was derived from the inter-calibrated AMSR-E/2 multi-frequency brightness temperature, using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA). The MCCA comprehensively considers the physical relationship between multiple microwave channels and could simultaneously retrieve frequency- and polarization-dependent VODs and SM.\nThe new MCCA AMSR-E/2 SM dataset was validated over 25 dense soil moisture networks from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) watersheds. The results showed that MCCA performs best in terms of ubRMSE among the current publicly available SM datasets related to AMSR-E/2. In addition, polarization-, frequency-dependent VODs from MCCA may provide new insights for better understanding the water fluxes in plant physiology.",
