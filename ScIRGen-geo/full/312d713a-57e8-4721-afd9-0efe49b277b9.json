            "description": "This dataset is the spatial distribution map of the marshes in the source area of the Yellow River near the Zaling Lake-Eling Lake, covering an area of about 21,000 square kilometers. The data set is classified by the Landsat 8 image through an expert decision tree and corrected by manual visual interpretation. The spatial resolution of the image is 30m, using the WGS 1984 UTM projected coordinate system, and the data format is grid format. The image is divided into five types of land, the land type 1 is “water body”, the land type 2 is “high-cover vegetation”, the land type 3 is “naked land”, and the land type 4 is “low-cover vegetation”, and the land type 5 is For \"marsh\", low-coverage vegetation and high-coverage vegetation are distinguished by vegetation coverage. The threshold is 0.1 to 0.4 for low-cover vegetation and 0.4 to 1 for high-cover vegetation.",
            "instructions": "The dataset files are uniformly packaged in the “result” folder, and the “resultgrid” grid format file can be opened using ArcGis software to view the classification results of the Yellow River source marsh. You can use the ArcGis Import Symbology feature to import a preset layer by opening the \"resultgrid.lyr\" layer file.",

This involves capturing specific geographical and environmental data, such as permafrost boundaries, permafrost temperatures, and underground ice thickness, and storing them in a digital format like ESRI's Shape format for use in various applications, including geographic information systems (GIS).",

                    "Answer": "Using a dataset derived from digitizing paper maps, such as the one based on the 1997 Russian Academy of Sciences map, may lead to less precise permafrost mapping compared to modern remote sensing techniques. This is because digitized maps are limited by the resolution and accuracy of the original paper maps, while remote sensing can provide more current and high-resolution data, potentially improving the accuracy of permafrost boundaries, temperature, and underground ice thickness information.",

This conversion enables integration with other geospatial datasets and enhances the ability to monitor changes over time, especially in the context of climate change.",
