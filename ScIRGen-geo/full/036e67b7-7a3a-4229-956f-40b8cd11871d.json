            "description": "The monthly High spatial resolution human Thermal Index Collection (HiTIC-Monthly) includes near-surface air temperature (SAT) and 11 commonly used human-perceived temperature indices: indoor Apparent Temperature (ATin), outdoor shaded Apparent Temperature (ATout), Discomfort Index (DI), Effective Temperature (ET), Heat Index (HI), Humidex (HMI), Modified Discomfort Index (MDI), Net Effective Temperature (NET), simplified Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (sWBGT), Wet-Bulb Temperature (WBT), and Wind Chill Temperature (WCT). This dataset has a high spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and covers mainland China from January 2003 to December 2020. The overall R-square, root mean square error, and mean absolute error of the 12 thermal indices in the HiTIC dataset are 0.996, 0.693°C, and 0.512°C, respectively. It is compressed or stacked by year, and each zip package or stack is composed of 12 monthly images in the GeoTIFF or NetCDF format. The unit of the dataset is 0.01 degree Celsius (°C), and the values are stored in an integer type (Int16) for saving storage space, and need to be divided by 100 to get the values in degree Celcius when in use. The projection coordinate system of the dataset is Albers Equal Area Conic Projection. The naming rule and other detailed information can be found in “README.pdf”. \n\nIf you have any questions when using the HiTIC-Monthly dataset, please feel free to contact Miss Hui Zhang via zhangh573@mail2.sysu.edu.cn, Dr. Ming Luo via luom38@mail.sysu.edu.cn, or Dr. Yongquan Zhao via zhaoyq66@mail.sysu.edu.cn.

Moreover, the data exhibit high agreements with the observations across spatial and temporal dimensions, demonstrating the broad applicability of our dataset. A comparison with two existing datasets also suggests that our high-resolution dataset can describe a more explicit spatial distribution of the thermal information, showing great potentials in fine-scale (e.g., intra-urban) studies. Further investigation reveals that nearly all thermal indices exhibit increasing trends in most parts of China during 2003–2020. The increase is especially significant in North China, Southwest China, the Tibetan Plateau, and parts of Northwest China, during spring and summer."
