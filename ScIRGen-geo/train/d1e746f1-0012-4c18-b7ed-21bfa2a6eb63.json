            "description": "The data are U-Pb isotopic dating data of I-type granite in Zhalantun area, major and trace geochemical data of whole rock, major and trace data of plagioclase and biotite, major and trace geochemical data of accessory minerals zircon and apatite, and in-situ Nd isotopic data of apatite. The samples were collected from three types of I-type granites in Zhalantun area, Daxinganling, Northeast China. U-Pb isotopic chronology data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of minerals are obtained by electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In situ Nd isotopic geochemical data of minerals were obtained by multi receiver laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The obtained data can define the age and source characteristics of regional magmatism, and reveal that zircon and apatite in granite can effectively trace the evolution of granitic magma.",

                    "Answer": "U-Pb isotopic dating data is collected using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) on zircon minerals. Whole-rock major and trace geochemical data are obtained using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Mineral major and trace geochemical data are collected using electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) and LA-ICP-MS. In-situ Nd isotopic geochemical data are acquired using multi-collector LA-ICP-MS. These techniques can be optimized by ensuring proper calibration, using high-purity standards, and conducting repeated analyses to verify the reproducibility and accuracy of the results.",
