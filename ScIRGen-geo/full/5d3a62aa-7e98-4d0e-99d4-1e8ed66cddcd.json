                    "Answer": "EPMA, or Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer, is a data collection method used to obtain quantitative chemical compositions of small volumes of solid materials. In geological studies, it is used to analyze minerals such as sphalerite in polymetallic deposits by measuring the concentration of elements like Zn, S, Mn, Fe, Cd, and Cu. The method involves using an electron probe equipped with wave spectrometers and energy spectrometers to conduct analyses under specific conditions, such as an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, a beam current of 20 nA, and a beam spot size of 5 μm. Data correction is performed using the ZAF method, which accounts for atomic number, absorption, and fluorescence effects.",
