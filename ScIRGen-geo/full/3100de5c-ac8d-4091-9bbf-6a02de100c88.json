How Did Urban Land Expand in China between 1992 and 2015? A Multi-Scale Landscape Analysis. PLoS ONE 11 (5): e0154839. To produce this dataset, the nighttime light data, vegetation index data, and land surface temperature data were preprocessed to obtain the multi-source remote sensing data in China from 1992 to 2020, and the economic regionalization, selection of samples, support vector machine classification, and inter-annual correction were used to extract the dynamic information of urban built-up area. According to the accuracy assessment based on Landsat TM/ETM+ data, Kappa coefficient is 0.60, overall accuracy is 92.62% This dataset has been used to assess the impacts of urban expansion on natural habitats and cropland, and can provide data support for understanding China’s urban expansion and its effects.",

Rapid urban expansion has resulted in massive cropland loss in China, with mean annual reductions of 1,300 km2 between 1990 and 2000 and 2,000 km2 between 2000 and 2010. Between 1992 and 2012, 8,647 km2 of natural habitat became newly developed urban land, threatening over 100 endangered species, mainly amphibians and reptiles."

We also found that urban land in China expanded mainly by occupying 3.31 × 104 km2 of cropland, which comprised 54.67% of the total area of expanded urban land. Among the three modes of growth—infilling, edge expansion, and leapfrog—edge expansion was the main cause of cropland loss. Cropland loss resulting from edge expansion of urban land totalled 2.51 × 104 km2, accounting for over 75% of total cropland loss."
