            "titleEn": "HiWATER: The multi-scale observation experiment on evapotranspiration over heterogeneous land surfaces 2012 (MUSOEXE-12)-dataset of flux observation matrix (NO.2 large aperture scintillometer)",
            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at site No.2 in the flux observation matrix. There were two types of LASs at site No.2: German BLS900 and German BLS450. The observation periods were from 7 June to 19 September, 2012, and 18 June to 19 September, 2012, for the BLS900 and the BLS450, respectively. The north tower is placed with the receiver of BLS900 and the transmitter of BLS450, and the south tower is placed with the transmitter of BLS900 and the receiver of BLS450. The site (north: 100.363° E, 38.883° N; south: 100.362° E, 38.857° N) was located in the Yingke irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1552.75 m. The underlying surface between the two towers contains corn, greenhouse, and village. The effective height of the LASs was 33.45 m; the path length was 2841 m. Data were sampled at 1 min intervals.\nRaw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality-controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The main quality control steps were as follows. (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 was beyond the saturated criterion (Cn2>4.08E-14). (2) Data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS900: Average X Intensity<1000; BLS450: Minimum X<50). (3) Data were rejected within 1 h of precipitation. (4) Data were rejected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). The sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining with meteorological data and based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory.\nThere were several instructions for the released data. (1) The data were primarily obtained from BLS900 measurements; missing flux measurements from the BLS900 were filled with measurements from the BLS450. Missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: data/time (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H_LAS, W/m^2). (3) In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xlsx format.  Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2016) (for multi-scale observation experiment or sites information), Xu et al. (2013) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "A large aperture scintillometer is an instrument used to measure surface evapotranspiration by observing the fluctuations in the refractive index of air. These fluctuations are related to the heat fluxes from the surface. The instrument typically consists of a transmitter and a receiver placed at a certain distance apart, with data being collected over this path to determine the heat flux, which is a component of evapotranspiration.",

                    "Answer": "Quality control steps are necessary due to various factors, including the saturation of the air refractive index structure parameter (Cn2), weak demodulation signal strength, interference from precipitation, and weak turbulence conditions under stable atmospheric conditions. These factors can introduce errors or inconsistencies in the scintillometer data, impacting the accuracy of the sensible heat flux calculations.",

                    "Answer": "The use of a multi-instrument flux observation matrix, as seen with large aperture scintillometers like BLS900 and LAS_NQ, can enhance data accuracy by capturing diverse environmental variables and compensating for missing data through instrument complementation. However, this approach might introduce challenges in data consistency due to differing instrument specifications and potential time gaps in data collection. The iterative calculation of sensible heat flux using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and quality control steps can mitigate some of these issues, but the heterogeneity of the landscape, such as varying land covers like cornfields and villages, might still influence the uniformity of the measurements.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps for processing and quality controlling data from a large aperture scintillometer include: (1) Removing data where the structure parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2) reaches saturation; (2) Excluding data with weak demodulation signal strength; (3) Discarding data during precipitation and for one hour before and after the event; (4) Eliminating data under stable conditions with weak turbulence (where friction velocity u* is less than 0.1 m/s). The processed data are provided as 30-minute averages, with sensible heat flux derived using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory through iterative calculations. If data from the primary scintillometer (BLS900_2) is missing, it is supplemented with data from the secondary instrument (LAS_NQ), and any remaining missing data is marked with -6999.",

                    "Answer": "The use of large aperture scintillometers like BLS900 and LAS_NQ enables the accurate measurement of sensible heat flux. The data processing techniques include quality control steps such as removing saturated Cn2 data, weak demodulation signal data, data during and around precipitation events, and weak turbulence data under stable conditions. These advancements and techniques allow for reliable 30-minute average data calculation based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory combined with automatic meteorological station data.",
