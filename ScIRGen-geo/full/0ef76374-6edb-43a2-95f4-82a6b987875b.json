            "description": "Previous research doesn't have a system in China's coastal cities fortification level of data. Therefore, based on multi-source data, this study sorts out the coastal protection standard (return period) of China. At the national level, more than 60 % of coastline was protected by dikes. Fortification level data is an important parameter in the flood risk assessment and can be used for reasonable evaluation of regional disaster risk and degree of vulnerability. Adding fortification level parameters can help improve the coastal flood loss - height curve. Combing the data of land use with asset exposure data, can calculate the flood disaster risk. If considering dam for coastal adaptation measures, we can further calculate fortification level of cost-effectiveness.",

It is an important parameter in flood risk assessment, used to evaluate disaster risk and determine vulnerability levels. By incorporating this parameter, it is possible to improve the loss-height curve for coastal flooding, and when combined with land use data and asset exposure data, it can help calculate flood disaster risk. Additionally, considering levees as coastal adaptation measures, the cost-effectiveness of defense levels can be further calculated.",

This fusion of data allows for a more detailed understanding of the defense levels, which is crucial for accurately assessing disaster risk and vulnerability. By improving the loss-height curve for coastal floods and combining it with land use and asset exposure data, a more precise calculation of flood disaster risk can be achieved, potentially leading to more effective disaster preparedness and response strategies.",
