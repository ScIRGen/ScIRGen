            "description": "On 29 June 2012 (UTC+8), a CASI/SASI sensor carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a visible near Infrared hyperspectral airborne remote sensing experiment, which is located in the observation experimental area (30×30 km). The relative flight altitude is 3500 meters（an elevation of 3500 meters）, The wavelength of CASI and SASI is 380-1050 nm and 950-2450 nm, respectively. The spatial resolution of CASI and SASI is 1 m and 2.4 m, respectively. \nThrough the ground sample points and atmospheric data, the data are recorded in reflectance processed by geometric correction  and atmospheric correction based on 6S model.",

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
