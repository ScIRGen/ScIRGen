            "description": "Adopt aster with 30 meter resolution provided by Heihe project data management center GDEM data and 90 meter resolution SRTM data are two sets of grid data, as well as multi-source point data. These point data include radar point cloud elevation data in the middle and upper reaches; elevation data extracted from soil sample points and vegetation sample in the data management center of Heihe plan; elevation data extracted from climate and hydrological stations; and elevation sample data measured by the research group. By using the HASM scaling up algorithm, the grid data of different sources and different precision are fused with the elevation point data to obtain the high-precision DEM data of Heihe River Basin. First of all, the accuracy of two groups of grid data is verified by using various point data. According to the results of accuracy verification, different grid data are used as the trend surface of data fusion in different regions. The residuals of various point data and trend surface are calculated, and the residual surface is obtained by interpolation with HASM algorithm, and the trend surface and residual surface are superposed to obtain the final DEM surface. The spatial resolution is 500 meters.",

This involves using ASTER GDEM and SRTM raster data of different resolutions, combined with various point data sources such as radar point cloud elevation data, elevation data extracted from soil and vegetation samples, and climate hydrology station data. The HASM upscaling algorithm is utilized to merge these sources, ensuring accurate elevation representation by verifying against point data and adjusting the fusion process based on precision validation results.",

This method allows for the correction of errors and biases in individual data sources through the calculation of residuals and trend surfaces, leading to a refined DEM. The applicability of the model is improved in diverse areas of the watershed, offering better support for hydrological and environmental studies.",

The next step is to validate the accuracy of the raster data using the point data. Based on the validation results, different raster data are selected as the trend surface for data fusion in different regions. The residuals between the point data and the trend surface are calculated and interpolated using the HASM algorithm to obtain a residual surface. Finally, the trend surface and the residual surface are combined to create the final high-resolution DEM surface with a spatial resolution of 500 meters.",
