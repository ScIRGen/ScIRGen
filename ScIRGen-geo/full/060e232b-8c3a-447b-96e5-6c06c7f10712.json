            "description": "This data set consists of clay mineral analysis data of stari slankamen loess profile in Serbia. Using x'pert Pro MPD powder X-ray (XRD) manufactured by panalytical company in the Netherlands, we carried out clay mineral determination and Analysis on the comprehensive profile of stari slankamen loess at an interval of about 10-20 cm. The total thickness of the profile is about 41 meters and the number of samples is 279. The reproducibility of the scanning angle of the instrument is ± 0.0001 degrees. The experimental analysis was completed in Shandong Key Laboratory of tourism, resources and environment, Taishan University. This data reflects the change characteristics of clay minerals in the long-term loess sequence in Serbia, and is of great significance for the study of paleoclimate / Paleoenvironment in southeastern Europe.",
