            "description": "This data set is a multi-scale data set of water balance elements in the source area of the Yellow River and the Heihe River Basin of Qilian Mountains, which can provide basis and reference for water resources management and water balance analysis. The data are based on the simulation results of SWAT model, and then analyzed and counted by ArcGIS and Excel software. The water balance elements include precipitation, snowfall, evapotranspiration, groundwater, soil water and runoff. The time scale includes annual scale and monthly scale, while the spatial scale includes watershed scale, river reach scale, sub basin scale, altitude zone scale and vegetation type scale. The data has been applied to water resources evaluation, benefit evaluation and operation guidance of artificial precipitation enhancement.",
