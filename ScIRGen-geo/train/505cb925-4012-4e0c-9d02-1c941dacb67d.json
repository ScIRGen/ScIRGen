            "description": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS geochemical composition of the whole rock, and tims Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition show that the early Mesozoic Baoji pluton belongs to high-k calc alkaline, quasi aluminous weak peraluminous series. From granodiorite to K-feldspar granite, the contents of MgO, feot, TiO2, Cao and P2O5 decrease with the increase of SiO2 content. Combined with the whole rock Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic characteristics, the granodiorite mainly came from partial melting of the crust and experienced magma mixing. Monzodiorite is rich in Sr-Nd isotopic composition and high in Mg # and MgO, which is derived from the metasomatic lithospheric mantle. The K-feldspar granites have evolved Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions and are derived from partial melting of the ancient crust. The data comes from the scientific research project \"deep process and resource effect of Yanshanian major geological events\" (2016YFC0600404).",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating is a technique used to determine the U-Pb age of zircon minerals in geological samples. It involves using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to measure the isotopic composition of zircon crystals, providing insights into the age and history of geological formations.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in these oxide contents as SiO2 levels increase suggest differentiation processes typical of igneous rock formation, where minerals crystallize and separate at different stages. The decreasing trends in MgO, FeOT, TiO2, CaO, and P2O5 with increasing SiO2 content indicate the fractional crystallization of minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase. This pattern reflects the evolution from more mafic to felsic compositions, suggesting a progression from granodiorite to potassium feldspar granite. These patterns also imply a variety of magmatic sources and processes, including partial melting of the crust and magma mixing, as well as the influence of crustal and mantle-derived materials.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing LA-ICP-MS zircon dating along with XRF and ICP-MS methods enhances the accuracy and reliability of geochemical composition analysis by providing detailed insights into the chronological sequence of rock formation, as well as precise measurements of elemental and isotopic compositions. This comprehensive approach allows for a more thorough understanding of the magmatic processes, including partial melting and magma mixing that contributed to the formation of the early Mesozoic Baoji pluton.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to understand the formation and evolution of the Baoji intrusive rocks by determining the U-Pb ages, geochemical compositions, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic characteristics. This helps in identifying the sources of the rocks, such as crustal partial melting and magma mixing, as well as the contribution from the lithospheric mantle, thereby contributing to the broader understanding of the tectonic and magmatic processes in the North Qinling orogenic belt during the Late Triassic.",
