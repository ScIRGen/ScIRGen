            "description": "Automatic weather stations have been proved to be a powerful tool for monitoring the near surface meteorological elements of glaciers/caps to determine the surface energy budget, so as to quantify glaciers/caps ablation and its response to climate change. This data set introduces the PANDA transect automatic weather station network, which includes 11 automatic weather stations (AWS), Zhongshan, Panda 100, Panda 200, Panda 300, Panda 400, Taishan, Eagle, Panda 1100, Dome A, Kunlun and Panda s. The transect network spans the Prydz Bay Amery ice shelf Dome A area, from the coast to the top of the southeast Antarctica ice sheet. The transect network is roughly along longitude ~77 ° e, and the latitude range is 69.37°S-82.33°S, covering all geographical and climatic units in the southeast polar region. All automatic weather stations in the network measure air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction every hour, and some automatic weather stations can also measure surface temperature and short/longwave radiation. All automatic station data is transmitted in real time through Argos system. The data quality is very reliable, and the data of Dome A and Eagle station have been widely used. At present, the data set has been updated by us to 2021. Except Zhongshan and Panda S, all other stations are multi-layer observations, mainly with four heights of 1/2/4/6m. The data has been subject to strict quality control. We plan to update it once a year. This data set is of great value to climate change estimation, extreme weather event diagnosis, data assimilation, weather forecasting, etc. in the Antarctic region.",
            "instructions": "File naming: meteorological data is stored in text form. The name of the file is \"station.csv\", where station represents the name of specific stations, such as Zhongshan, panda 100, etc. Each file contains meteorological data such as air temperature, relatively humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction, and the time span is from the beginning of the establishment of the station to the present.\nData reading method: all files in this data set are in CSV format, which can be opened directly in Excel. The relevant instructions in the file are in readme file. This file can be opened by text program (such as Notepad). The main content is meteorological elements such as temperature, humidity, pressure and wind observed by 11 automatic weather stations in the southeast pole.",

Great efforts have been made to study Antarctic climate change under global warming because of its role in the climate system and its capability to greatly impact global sea level rise (IPCC, 2019; Huai et al., 2019). However, the reliability of Antarctic climate change estimation and weather forecasting is still under debate (Hines et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). This is a consequence of the paucity of observations, especially at long-term inland weather stations, which can be directly assimilated into models and reanalysis data (Vignon et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2019)."

Due to heavy hoar frost in the Antarctic inland, the anemometers with a vertical axis at Eagle, Dome A and Panda S often froze during austral winter, which led to invalid measurements (Zhou et al., 2009)."

            "methods": [
                "All data are checked initially to ensure integrity, consistently with the approach of Ma et al. (2010), Lazzara et al. (2012), and Wawrzyniak and Osuch (2020). A schematic diagram of the data-processing workflow is shown in Fig. 2. Firstly, Argos reception may lead to duplicated records or time dislocation; these are removed. For those AWSs with measurements of air temperature and wind speed at multiple levels, a check of the vertical profiles provides particularly strong validation. If the vertical gradients are physically consistent, then the absolute values are likely to be accurate. Secondly, different variables are compared to check their consistency. For instance, wind direction will be eliminated when wind speed is zero. In addition, the height of sensors might change with snow accumulation. A correction method for this error has been introduced in Ma et al. (2008) and Smeets et al. (2018). Daily mean values are averaged from hourly data, and then monthly and annual mean values are progressively calculated. Similarly to the methodology of Maturilli et al. (2013) and Zou et al. (2021), missing values are handled depending on their duration. If more than 21 % of data (5 h) during 1 d, 12 % data (4 d) within 1 month or 25 % of data (3 months) within 1 year are missing, these daily/monthly/annual data are considered a missing value."

                    "Answer": "Invalid measurements in meteorological data collection refer to data that are incorrect or unusable due to errors in the measurement process. In the context of Antarctic weather stations, such invalid measurements may occur due to equipment problems like the freezing of anemometers during the austral winter, especially at inland sites such as Eagle, Dome A, and Panda S. This can happen because heavy hoar frost causes mechanical sensors with vertical axes to freeze, leading to disruptions in data collection.",

                    "Answer": "In coastal areas, automatic weather stations tend to have more continuous data collection due to fewer interruptions compared to inland areas. Inland stations, such as those at Eagle and Dome A, face challenges like anemometer freezing during winter, which leads to invalid measurements. Coastal stations are less affected by such harsh weather conditions, offering more reliable sensor performance.",

For AWSs with measurements at multiple levels, vertical profiles are checked for physical consistency to validate absolute values. Different variables are also compared for consistency, such as eliminating wind direction when wind speed is zero. Sensor height changes due to snow accumulation are corrected using methods described by Ma et al. (2008) and Smeets et al. (2018).
