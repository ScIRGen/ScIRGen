            "description": "Monthly soil moisture data measured in the edge of the Tibetan Plateau cover 10, 40, 80 and 120 cm depth. The monthly values are from quality controlled hourly measurement at 21 stations located in the upper Huangshui River Basin, Yarlung Tsangpo Basin and Gaizi River Basin. The locations distribute in the westerly, southeast Asia monsoon and east Asia monsoon dominated regions. The equipment is produced by Decagon and Campbell companies. These dataset can be used in studies in hydrology, ecosystem, meteorology.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods using Decagon probes and Campbell data loggers are robust as they provide continuous observation records at multiple depths (10, 40, 80, and 120 centimeters) and allow for quality control through hourly data averaging. These methods are widely used in the field due to their ability to capture detailed temporal changes in soil temperature and moisture across different regions, including the westerlies, South Asian monsoon, and East Asian monsoon areas. Alternative methods may vary in accuracy and reliability depending on the specific environmental conditions and the technological sophistication involved in data logging and sensor deployment.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of specific depths for soil temperature and moisture data collection may be influenced by the need to understand soil dynamics at different levels, which are crucial for agricultural research, meteorology, and land-atmosphere interaction studies. These depths could have been selected to capture variations in soil properties and their impact on surface processes, reflecting the effects of climatic zones such as the westerly, South Asian, and East Asian monsoon areas.",

                    "Answer": "The hourly soil temperature and moisture data are subjected to a quality control process before being averaged to derive the monthly values. This process involves the use of probes from Decagon and data loggers from Campbell to observe and record the soil temperature and moisture at different depths. The quality control ensures data accuracy and reliability across the various observational points distributed in different climatic zones such as the Westerlies, South Asian Monsoon, and East Asian Monsoon regions.",
