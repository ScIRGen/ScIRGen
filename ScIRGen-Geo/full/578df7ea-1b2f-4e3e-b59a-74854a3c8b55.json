            "description": "Snow water equivalent (the product of snow depth and density) is an important factor reflecting the change in snow cover on the ground surface, and it is also an important parameter in surface hydrological models and climatic models. As the “Headwaters of Asia”, the Tibetan Plateau is the source of several major rivers, which are fed with glacier and snow meltwater. Based on the sensitivity of passive microwave radiation to snow, these monitoring data enable long-term inversion of snow water equivalents in the High Asia region. The data set includes daily snow water equivalent, monthly snow water equivalent and five-day snow water equivalent, and these data can be applied in analyses of local hydrology, animal husbandry production and other fields.",
            "descriptionCn": "雪水当量（积雪深度与密度之积）是反映地表积雪量变化的重要因子，是地表水文模型和气候模式中的一个重要参数。青藏高原作为亚洲水塔，多条大江大河补给主要依靠高原上冰川或积雪的融化。基于被动微波对积雪监测的敏感性，本数据实现了长时间序列的高亚洲地区雪水当量的反演。数据集包含日雪水当量、月雪水当量以及每五日雪水当量，可服务于当地水文、畜牧业生产等方面。",

The dynamic changes of snow in this area have notable effects on water, energy balance and regional climate. Snow water equivalent (SWE) products (e.g. ESA GlobSnow product) are insufficient over High Asia region, and global SWE retrieval algorithms (e.g. NASA SWE algorithm) are always overestimated when applied in High Asia region. In conventional ground meteorological station observations, snow depth is usually measured directly, and snow water equivalent values need to be obtained through measured snow depth and snow density.
