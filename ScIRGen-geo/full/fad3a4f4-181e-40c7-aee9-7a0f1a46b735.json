            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace data, Sr nd Pb isotopic data, zircon U-Pb dating data and pyrite S isotopic data of adakitic rocks in baoshujian, Anqing Guichi ore concentration area. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, trace element data by ICP-MS analysis, zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data by la-mc-icp-ms analysis, and pyrite S isotopic composition data by MC-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the obtained data, we can explore and summarize the diagenetic process and mineralization of baoshujian mining area, and then fill in the gap in the mineralization period of 1455ma in the Guichi ore concentration area of Anqing, and provide theoretical support for the prospecting work of baoshujian and even the whole Guichi ore concentration area of Anqing. At the same time, it has a certain guiding significance for the division of metallogenic epoch in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.",

These methods allow for precise dating and isotopic composition analysis, which can fill the knowledge gap regarding the mineralization period around 145.5 Ma in the Anqing-Guichi mineral district. This can provide theoretical support for mineral exploration in Baoshuijian and the broader Anqing-Guichi area, and also offer insights into the division of mineralization ages in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.",

These methods enable a comprehensive exploration of the petrogenesis and metallogenesis processes in the mining area.",
