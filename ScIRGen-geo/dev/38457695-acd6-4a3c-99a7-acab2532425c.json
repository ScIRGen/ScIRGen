Then, the eCognition platform is employed to apply an object-oriented remote sensing classification method. This includes multi-scale segmentation, constructing a feature space, and conducting remote sensing monitoring of land use/land cover in critical node areas. The classification system includes categories such as Forest, Cultivated Land, Paddy field, Dry farmland, Water, River, Lake, Wetland, Artificial surface, Mining area, Bareland, Grassland, and Shrubland. An accuracy analysis is performed based on limited samples, achieving a classification accuracy of over 90%.",
