            "description": "Data description: This dataset includes the grid data of annual temperature  and annual precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau from 1998 to 2017. It is the basic data for study of climate change and its impact on the ecological environment. Data source and processing: The meta data was aquired from the temperature and precipitation daily  data of China's ground high-density stations (above 2,400 national meteorological stations) based on the latest compilation of the National Meteorological Information Center's basic data. After removing the missing stations,  the software's thin plate spline method  in ANUSPLIN was used to perform spatial interpolation, in order to generate grid data with spactial resolution of 1 km on the Tibetan Plateau . Data application: This data can be used to indentify the impact of climate change on the ecological environment.",

                    "Answer": "The Thin Plate Spline (TPS) method is used to perform spatial interpolation of temperature and precipitation data by utilizing data from over 2400 national meteorological observation stations after preprocessing. This method generates annual gridded data with a spatial resolution of 1 km for the Tibetan Plateau and a 200 km buffer zone. Its applicability and accuracy can be compared to other spatial interpolation techniques by considering its capability to handle missing data, the density of available observational data, and the complex topography and climate variability of the region.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of the ANUSPLIN software's Thin Plate Spline (TPS) method for spatial interpolation is influenced by the need to handle the complex topography and variable climate conditions of the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions. It allows for effective spatial interpolation of climate data from over 2400 national meteorological observation stations, ensuring that the data is accurately represented over a 1km spatial resolution grid, even in areas with missing station data.",

                    "Answer": "Using spatial interpolation methods like the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) for generating gridded climate data can lead to increased accuracy and reliability by providing a more continuous surface representation from discrete data points. This is especially useful when dealing with regions with sparse meteorological stations, as it helps fill in gaps and offers finer spatial resolution. However, the reliability of the interpolated data heavily depends on the quality and density of the original data points, as well as the assumptions made during interpolation, potentially introducing biases if not carefully managed.",
