                "Soil moisture regulates water, energy and carbon exchanges between land and atmosphere, especially in transitional (semi-arid and semi-humid) regions, and thus it is defined as one of Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) essential climate variables. Soil moisture is a key component in hydro-meteorological forecasting and seasonal climate prediction. Anomalies of spring soil moisture in East Asia may affect summer monsoon circulations and precipitation through changing land surface energy budget. Moreover, soil moisture is crucial to the formation of flood and drought events and is highly concerned in agriculture and ecosystem management. Currently, there are regional or global soil moisture products, but it is still challenging to improve their accuracy. Land surface modeling is widely used to estimate soil moisture values, but the accuracy of the modeling highly depends on model structure, model parameter specification, and meteorological forcing data. Human activities (such as irrigation) may also magnify errors in land surface simulations. On the other hand, there is a long history to estimate soil moisture values from passive microwave signals. A number of evaluations show that both land surface modeling and microwave remote sensing may have considerable biases in soil moisture. Land data assimilation technique is considered a better way to estimate soil moisture through optimally using the dynamics of land surface modeling and the objectivity of satellite remote sensing."

The main purpose of this study is to present the development and validation of a new soil moisture product. In this study, a new soil moisture product for Mainland China was produced through assimilating the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) brightness temperature (TB) data in a land surface model. With the new product, the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture in Mainland China was investigated."

                "Establishing soil moisture data sets through a land data assimilation system (LDAS) involves many challenges, such as how to specify model parameter values, how to develop reliable meteorological forcing and how to obtain ground truth for validations at pixel scales. Particularly, inappropriate parameter values in model operator (a land surface model) or observation operator (e.g. a forward radiative transfer model) lead to systematic deviations in assimilation results. In the WTP-Ngari network, both the assimilation result and the LSM-simulation one show the dry feature of this area, but the former does not perform better than the latter. Therefore, it is still challenging to improve soil moisture estimates for drylands with the LDAS."

            "methods": [
                "The LDAS was run at 0.25 degree in the Mainland China, and the assimilation covers the whole period of AMSR-E (June 2002 – September 2011) so that we provided nearly 10-year data of soil moisture. In Pass 1, the values of key parameters (i.e. soil porosity, sand content, clay content, two roughness parameters (Q, h) and one vegetation optical parameter (b) for microwave radiative transfer) are assumed to be time-invariant and estimated through minimizing the difference between the AMSR-E observed TB and the LDAS-estimated TB over a long-term window. In Pass 2, the estimated parameter values are used as inputs of the LDAS, and the near-surface soil moisture (volumetric water content) is estimated through assimilating the AMSR-E TB on a daily scale. The LDAS assimilates the TB data at three lower frequencies (6.9, 10.7, and 18.7 GHz) measured during the descending overpasses, since TB at the lower frequencies are more sensitive to soil moisture than the ones at the higher frequencies. In general, soil moisture has high spatial variability. The LDAS output represents an average at a quarter degree grid, which cannot be validated with single-point measurements. In this study, soil moisture data collected at three observational networks in the Tibetan Plateau were used to validate the LDAS estimate."

The meteorological data used to drive the LDAS is the China Meteorological Forcing Data (CMFD) that was developed by the authors. The CMFD covers the Mainland China with a spatial resolution of 0.1° and spans from 1979 to 2018 with a temporal resolution of 3 hours. The AMSR-E sensor worked from June 2002 to September 2011, and our LDAS yields the soil moisture product for this period. In this study, soil moisture data collected at three observational networks in the Tibetan Plateau were used to validate the LDAS estimate. The LDAS-produced soil moisture product contains three layers (0–5 cm, 5–20 cm, and 20–100 cm) of soil water content, with a unit of m3 m-3. Its temporal resolution is daily and spatial resolution is 0.25°. The data spans from June 2002 to September 2011, covering the Mainland China."

The spatial pattern of the soil moisture from the new product is consistent with that of soil porosity from an independent survey-based dataset, further confirming the credibility of the new product. According to this product, the transition regions in China show stronger seasonal variation of soil moisture than dry and wet regions, and drier regions have stronger inter-annual variability of soil moisture than wetter regions, particularly during transitional seasons (spring and autumn). Overall, we can see that assimilating AMSR-E TB into the LSM improves the soil moisture estimation as compared to the remote sensing products and the LSM simulation, particularly for relatively wet areas. Therefore, the LDAS can produce some essential features of soil moisture distribution. This cross-validation indirectly confirms the reasonability of the LDAS-derived soil moisture."

                "Soil moisture is a highly variable parameter in semiarid regions, where strong coupling between soil moisture and precipitation are suggested by Koster et al. (2004). Soil moisture estimation is imperative for hydrometeorological studies and water resources management (e.g., Pauwels et al. 2001; Wu and Dickinson 2004; de Goncalves et al. 2006), and how to estimate soil moisture with good accuracy is still a hot topic of land hydrology and satellite remote sensing. Land hydrological modeling is subject to errors in many factors, including meteorological forcing data, parameterization schemes, and model parameters. Remote sensing of passive microwave has been widely used to estimate soil moisture (e.g., Jackson 1993; Njoku and Entekhabi 1996; Shi et al. 1997; Njoku et al. 2003; Wen et al. 2003, 2005), as it is strongly affected by near-surface soil moisture but not much by atmospheric state. Microwave signals are also affected by other parameters, such as soil texture and surface roughness (Engman 1991); these parameters must be specified for estimating soil moisture from microwave data (Wang 1983; Wigneron et al. 2003; Njoku and Chan 2006). A land data assimilation system (LDAS), which combines a land surface model (LSM) and satellite signals, may provide a promising means for estimating soil moisture by assimilating microwave data to correct modeling errors (Reichle et al. 2001; Bach and Mauser 2003; Crow and Wood 2003; Ni-Meister et al. 2006; Li et al. 2007). The parameter specification is a common and crucial issue for land modeling, remote sensing, and data assimilation. Another common issue is how to make a full scale–match comparison between satellite-estimated soil moisture and in situ–observed soil moisture."
