            "description": "Based on Landsat data (kh-9 data in 1976 as auxiliary data), glacial lake data of nearly 40 years (1970s-2018) in the western Nyainqentanglha range were obtained by manual digitization and visual interpretation. The variation characteristics of glacial lake over 0.0036 square kilometers in terms of type, size, elevation and watershed were analyzed in detail. The results show that, between 1976 and 2018, the number of glacial lakes increased by 56% from 192 to 299 and their total area increased by 35% from 6.75 ± 0.13 square kilometers to 9.12 ± 0.13 square kilometers ; the type of glacial lake is changing obviously; the smaller glacial lake is changing faster; the expansion of glacial lake is developing to higher altitude.",

The increase in both the number and total area of ice lakes, along with their movement to higher altitudes, may reflect rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, impacting glacial dynamics and hydrology in this mountainous region.",

Additionally, changes in small-scale ice lakes occur more rapidly, and the expansion trends are moving towards higher elevations.",
