            "description": "Based on the previous research results, this paper collected the palynological sequence of the plateau strata from the published literature at home and abroad, and selected reliable records, in order to explore the information of human activities in this area. The selection principles are as follows: (1) the palynological sequence time should cover the middle and late Holocene (since 6.0kabp.)（ 2) The time series are expressed quantitatively in calendar year or 14C year time system（ 3) It has high resolution（ 4) According to the above principles, 28 fossil sporopollen sequences are selected in this area. Age correction: some of the 28 sequences are calendar years, and some are carbon 14 dating, so they are corrected to calendar years. Data acquisition: the sequence is quantified, and the sporopollen content and corresponding age of the sequence are read to ensure the validity of the data, The inflection point data is selected first, and the average sporopollen content data of less than 100 years is selected. A total of 568 sporopollen records are obtained from 28 sequences, Abstract and calculate the parasporal pollen records since the middle and late Holocene (6.0 ~ 2.0 Ka B.P.) in the merging cost area. Based on the original parasporal pollen records extracted from 28 stratigraphic fossil sporopollen sequences, the deviation method is used to standardize the sequence, so as to eliminate the dimensional differences between different sporopollen types and compare them, The original data after standardization is converted into standardized values, and then the average value of each record in each partition is calculated, so that it can be combined with the sporopollen records in the cost area, which is called companion index in this paper. It means that the higher the index is, the stronger the intensity of human activity is, and the lower the index is, the weaker it is",

                    "Answer": "The 'standardization process' involves normalizing the original human-associated pollen records extracted from stratigraphic fossil pollen sequences to eliminate differences in magnitude among various pollen types, allowing for comparison between them. This is achieved using the deviation method, converting the original data into standardized values, which are then used to calculate the average for each subregion. This helps synthesize the human-associated pollen record across the entire area of study, resulting in what is referred to as the 'accompanying human index,' where a higher index indicates stronger human activity intensity.",

                    "Answer": "In this domain, ensuring temporal accuracy involves the calibration of sequences that are measured in both calendar years and carbon-14 years, necessitating corrections to standardize them to calendar years. Maintaining high resolution is crucial, and sequences with gaps or insufficient resolution (less than 100 years) may require averaging of pollen data for specific periods. These procedures are essential to accurately reflect human activities over time and across different regions of the plateau.",

The ultimate goal is to extract, calculate, and synthesize companion pollen records from stratigraphic sequences to develop an index that reflects human activity intensity in the region during this period.",

Once selected, the sequences are calibrated to calendar years if necessary, and pollen content values and corresponding ages are quantitatively extracted. To ensure data validity, data points at turning points are prioritized, and for periods with less than 100-year resolution, average pollen content data is used. The extracted pollen records are then standardized using the deviation method to eliminate magnitude differences between different pollen types, allowing for comparison. The standardized records are averaged per region to synthesize the human-related pollen record, termed the companion index, which indicates the intensity of human activity.",
