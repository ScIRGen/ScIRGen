            "description": "This dataset includes the main critical loads of soils in China (maximum critical load for sulfur, minimum critical load for nitrogen, maximum critical load for nitrogen, and critical load of nutrient nitrogen). The calculation of critical loads is based on the steady-state mass balance model (SMB). We used high-resolution digital maps of soils, vegetation and other related data and did the calculations in ArcGIS. Soil weathering rate, net growth uptake, soil denitrification ratio and other key parameters were corrected in this study. This dataset can be used to evaluate the ecological benefits of nitrogen and sulfur reduction in China and to formulate reduction policies.",
            "instructions": "File name: The critical load data are stored in TIF format, and the names of the files are \"CLmaxS\", \"CLminN\", \"CLmaxN\" and \"CLnutN\", which represent the maximum critical load for sulfur, minimum critical load for nitrogen, maximum critical load for nitrogen, and critical load of nutrient nitrogen respectively.\nData read: The data can be imported using ArcGIS or other software.",
