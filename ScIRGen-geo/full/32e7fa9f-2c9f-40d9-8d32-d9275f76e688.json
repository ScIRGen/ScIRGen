            "description": "The dataset of airborne microwave radiometers (K&Ka) mission was obtained in the Binggou watershed flight zone on Mar. 30, 2008. \n     The frequency of K bands was 18.7 GHz at the nadir view angle without polarization; and the frequency of Ka band was 36.0 GHz with the scanning angle range ±12°. The plane took off at Zhangye airport at 12:43 (BJT) and landed at 15:44, along the scheduled 11 lines at the altitude about 5000m and speed about 220-250km/hr.  \n     The raw data include microwave radiometer (L&K) data and GPS data;  K band was instantaneous non-imaging observation recorded in text, which will be converted into brightness temperatures according to the calibration coefficients (filed with raw data together) and Ka band was recorded hex text, and the latter are aircraft longitude, latitude and attitude. Moreover, based on the respective real-time clock log, observations by the microwave radiometer and GPS can be integrated to offer coordinates matching for the former. Yaw, flip, and pitch motions of aircraft were ignored due to the low resolution of microwave radiometer observations. Observation information can also be rasterized, as required, after calibration and coordinates matching. K band resolution (x) and footprint can be  approximately estimated as x=0.3H (H is relative flight height); for Ka the resolution was 39m.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection involves flying an aircraft equipped with K&Ka band airborne microwave radiometers over the designated area. The K band operates at a frequency of 18.7GHz and performs nadir observations without polarization information, while the Ka band operates at a frequency of 36.0GHz and performs scanning imaging with vertical polarization within a ±12° scanning range. The aircraft flies at an altitude of approximately 5000m and a speed of 220-250 km/hr. The raw data consists of microwave radiometer data and GPS data. The K band data is recorded as instantaneous digital values in text files, while Ka band data is stored in hexadecimal text files and needs conversion to decimal for further processing. The GPS data logs the aircraft's latitude, longitude, and attitude parameters. To preprocess the data for usability, the digital values from the radiometer observations are converted to brightness temperature using calibration coefficients. The microwave observations are geographically matched with the GPS data by synchronizing their respective time stamps. The Ka band data requires additional processing to account for the angle scanning effect by assigning geographical coordinates to each of the 112 data points within the scanning range. Due to the coarse resolution of the microwave observations, the aircraft's yaw, roll, and pitch effects are generally ignored during data processing. After calibration and coordinate matching, the observation information can be rasterized, with the K band resolution approximately equal to the footprint, calculated as x=0.24H, and the Ka band resolution being 39m. This results in a processed product ready for user application.",
