It is a set of USGS global land cover classification standards that can be used in atmospheric models and land surface process models of land cover types in the Heihe River Basin.\nThe data covers the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The data uses Albers Conical Equal Area projection with a spatial resolution of 1 km. It is an ASCII file containing the land cover classification code and named: Rule_Based_Lulc_of_HRB2009.asc. You can directly use a text program (such as Notepad) to open and view the file, you can also input it in ArcGIS for other operations.\nThe NOAH land surface process parameter table and parameter table description matched with the data are provided. Users can refer to this parameter table to apply the data to the land surface process model. The two files are USGS_LULC_NOAHVEGPARM.TBL and NOAHVEGPARM_documentation.txt, both can be opened by the text program (such as Notepad).",

In models, LULC data and land surface parameter tables together express the spatial distribution of land surface characteristics. Many efforts have been made to explore the impact of LULC data on simulation results and how to produce suitable LULC classification systems, data, and parameter tables for simulation. These studies show that LULC data used for simulation must ensure accuracy, timeliness, and sufficient resolution, and must be accompanied by reliable parameter tables. Current global 1 km resolution LULC data under several classification systems are available, among which the USGS GLCC data is designated as default data for MM5 and WRF simulations. However, these global data have low accuracy in many areas outside North America, and in China, their accuracy is far below the global average, with significant uncertainty."

However, challenges arise due to the similarity in NDVI characteristics among certain categories like farmland and forest, which can lead to misclassification. The use of only NDVI and elevation data may be insufficient to accurately distinguish all land cover types, suggesting that additional data sources or features might be needed to improve classification accuracy.",

Another issue is the limited information from using only NDVI and elevation data. A potential method for improvement could involve incorporating additional data sources or features, such as soil type, climate data, or higher resolution imagery, to provide more comprehensive distinguishing characteristics for these categories.",
