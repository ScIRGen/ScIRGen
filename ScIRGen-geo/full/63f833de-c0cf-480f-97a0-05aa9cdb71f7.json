            "description": "The rainfall data set of the southern Qinghai Tibet Plateau is fused by the satellite and the ground station. The data is in ASCII format, with a temporal resolution of 1 day and a horizontal spatial resolution of 0.1 °， The time coverage is from June 10 to October 31 in 2014-2019, which can provide driving data for rainfall verification and hydrological simulation in the southern Tibetan Plateau.\nThe data set is based on the rainfall data of China Meteorological Administration and Hydrological Bureau of the Ministry of water resources after strict quality control , which is the highest density ground station network in the region so far.  Dynamic Bayesian Model Average method is used to merge satellite precipitation products, i.e., GPM-IMERG, GSMaP, and CMORPH, based on the likelihood measurements of a high-density rainfall gauge network. The statistical accuracy evaluation and hydrological simulation verification of the merged data preforms better than the source satellite data, and also better than the popular reanalysis data CHIRPS and MSWEP.",
            "instructions": "File name: rainfall data is stored in text format, and the file name is \"TP\"_ DBMAyyyymmdd. TXT \", where yyyy represents the year, mm represents the month, and DD represents the day, such as TP_ DBMA20140610.txt represents this ASCII file to describe the rainfall in the southern Tibetan Plateau on June 10, 2014.\nData reading mode: all ASCII files in the data set can be directly opened with a text program (such as Notepad). Except for the header file, the main content is the numerical representation of rainfall (unit: mm). If you want to display it with graphics, you can open it with ArcGIS. In the reading process, a grid format file will be generated, The grid file displayed is the graphic representation of the ASCII file.",
