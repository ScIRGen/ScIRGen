First, the NDVI data products were re-sampled from the spatial resolution of 1/12 degree to 0.5 degree, then the time series of every year was smoothed by the double-logistic method, and the smoothed curvature was calculated. The maximum curvature of spring was selected as the returning green stage of the vegetation in Spring. This data can be used to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of the Holarctic vegetation phenology in Spring.",

                    "Answer": "The double-logistic method is a data smoothing technique that is applied to time-series datasets to model and smooth the seasonal variations in vegetation indices. In the context of vegetation phenology datasets, this method helps in reducing noise and providing a clear representation of the temporal dynamics of vegetation growth and decline. Specifically, it is used to smooth the time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, which is crucial for accurately determining the timing of phenological events such as the spring green-up period.",

                    "Answer": "Resampling NDVI data involves changing the spatial resolution from a finer 1/12 degree to a coarser 0.5 degree, which may affect the spatial detail and precision of the dataset. On the other hand, the double-logistic smoothing method is used to process the time series data to reduce noise and enhance the identification of phenological events, such as the maximum curvature indicating the spring greening period. Both techniques serve different purposes: resampling focuses on altering spatial resolution, while smoothing addresses temporal data accuracy and clarity. The combination of these approaches allows for robust analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation phenology.",

                    "Answer": "The analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of spring green-up periods from a resampled NDVI dataset can provide insights into changes in global vegetation phenology, such as shifts in the timing of the growing season, potentially due to climate change or environmental factors. The process involves smoothing the time series using a double-logistic method and calculating curvature to determine the peak of spring green-up. Challenges in this approach may include handling noise in the NDVI data, ensuring accurate resampling, and selecting appropriate parameters for the smoothing and curvature calculations to accurately reflect phenological changes.",

                    "Answer": "Resampling NDVI data from 1/12 degree to 0.5 degree spatial resolution could lead to changes in the spatial detail of the data, potentially smoothing out local variations and reducing the granularity of the vegetation phenology analysis. This might impact the detection of fine-scale phenological changes and could influence the temporal and spatial characterization of vegetation green-up periods across the pan-Arctic region.",

This approach allows researchers to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of spring phenology in vegetation, particularly in the pan-Arctic region, over a long-term period from 1981 to 2013.",

After smoothing, the curvature is calculated, and the maximum curvature value in spring is selected as the indicator for the spring vegetation green-up period.",
