            "description": "1) The data includes the soil erosion modulus of 11 watersheds with a resolution of 30 m in the year of 2017 in Qinhai. 2）Based on the surface layer of rainfall erosivity R, soil erodibility K, slope length factor LS, vegetation coverage FVC, and rotation sampling survey unit, the Chinese soil erosion model (CSLE) was used to calculate soil erosin modulus in 11 watersheds respectively. Through spatial data processing (including chart linking and transformation, vector-grid conversion, and resampling),  R, K, LS factors were calculated from the regional thematic map of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and DEM. By half-month FVC, NPV, half-month rainfall erosivity data, we calculated the value of B factors  in each sampling watershed. The value of E factor was calculated based on the remote sensing interpretation result and engineering measure factor table. The value of tillage factor T was obtained from tillage zoning map and tillage measure table. And then the soil erosion modulus in each sampling watershed was calculated by the equation: A=R•K•LS•B•E•T. The selection of 11 watersheds was based on the layout of sampling survey in pan-third polar region. 3) Compared with the data of soil erosion intensity in the same region in the same year, there is no significant difference and the data quality is good.4) the data of soil erosion modulus is of great significance for studying the present situation of soil erosion in Pan third polar region, and it is also crucial for the implementation of the development policy of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of soil erosion studies, 'soil erosion modulus' refers to a measurement used to evaluate the rate of soil erosion within a specific area, calculated based on factors like rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, vegetation cover, and land management practices. It is a quantitative representation of soil loss over a unit area and time, used to assess the severity of soil erosion in various regions.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using the CSLE model involves calculating the soil erosion modulus based on factors such as rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, vegetation cover, and cultivation practices. These factors are derived through spatial data operations like resampling, vector-raster conversion, and data transformation. In comparison to other models, this method stands out due to its integration of multiple data layers and reliance on both remote sensing and field data to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness in assessing soil erosion.",

                    "Answer": "Using spatial data operations like resampling, chart linking, and vector-raster conversion allows for the transformation of regional thematic maps into sampling unit-specific factors such as rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility. This improves the precision of soil erosion assessments by ensuring that the calculated soil erosion modulus accurately reflects the conditions specific to each sampling unit. Moreover, these operations help maintain data quality by aligning different data sources and formats, thereby supporting consistent evaluation of soil erosion conditions across different small watersheds.",

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves using the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE), which is A=R•K•LS•B•E•T, where R is rainfall erosivity, K is soil erodibility, LS is slope length and steepness factor, B is a cover-management factor, E is an engineering measure factor, and T is a tillage factor. Spatial data operations include converting rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and DEM into R, K, and LS factors for sampling units through spatial data computations like map linking and conversion, and resampling. B factors are calculated using semi-monthly FVC, NPV, rainfall erosivity weights, and other land-use B factors. E factors are computed using remote sensing interpretation results and engineering measure factor tables, while tillage factors are obtained from the tillage zoning map and tillage measures table. These computations allow for the calculation of soil erosion modulus for each sampling unit in the selected small watersheds.",
