            "description": "The Chinese regional surface meteorological element data set is a set of near-surface meteorological and environmental element reanalysis data set developed by the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  The data set is based on the existing Princeton reanalysis data, GLDAS data, GEWEX-SRB radiation data and TRMM precipitation data in the world, and is made by combining the conventional meteorological observation data of China Meteorological Administration.  The temporal resolution is 3 hours and the horizontal spatial resolution is 0.1, including 7 factors (variables) including near-surface air temperature, near-surface air pressure, near-surface air specific humidity, near-surface full wind speed, ground downward short wave radiation, ground downward long wave radiation and ground precipitation rate.\n\nThe physical meaning of each variable:\n| Meteorological Element || Variable Name || Unit || Physical Meaning\n| near-surface temperature ||temp|| K || instantaneous near-surface (2m) temperature\n| surface pressure || pres|| Pa || instantaneous surface pressure\n| specific humidity of near-surface air || shum || kg/ kg || instantaneous specific humidity of near-surface air\n| near ground full wind speed || wind || m /s || instantaneous near ground (anemometer height) full wind speed\n| downward short wave radiation || srad || W/m2 || 3-hour average (-1.5 HR ~+1.5 HR) downward short wave radiation\n| Downward Long Wave Radiation ||lrad ||W/m2 ||3-hour Average (-1.5 hr ~+1.5 hr) Downward Long Wave Radiation\n| precipitation rate ||prec||mm/hr ||3-hour average (-3.0 HR ~ 0.0 HR) precipitation rate\nFor more information, please refer to the \"User's Guide for China Meteorological Al Forcing Dataset\" published with the data.\n\nThe main changes in the latest version (01.06.0014) are:\n1. Extend the data to December 2015 (except for short-wave and long-wave data, only until October 2015; the data from November to December 2015 are interpolated based on GLDAS data, and the error may be too large);\n2. Set the minimum wind speed at 0.05 m/s;\n3. Fixed a bug in the previous radiation algorithm to make our short wave and long wave data more reasonable in the morning and evening periods.\n4. bug of precipitation data has been corrected, and the period involved in the change is 2011-2015.",

In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Two new global land cover data sets, Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover (MODIS land cover) have recently became available. The Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) implemented the GLC-2000 project in partnership with more than 30 partner institutions around the world, using Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) VEGETATION 1-km satellite data (Fritz et al., 2003). Boston University prepared the MODIS land cover data using MODIS 1-km satellite data on board the Terra satellite (Friedl et al., 2002). Both data sets were prepared with the same fundamental goal: to improve our understanding of the extent and distribution of the major land cover types of the world. The information generated can be used for various applications including ecosystem and biodiversity assessments, climate change studies, and environmental modeling (Brown, Loveland, Ohlen, & Zhu, 1999; Giri, Defourny, & Shrestha, 2003; Loveland & Belward, 1997; Loveland, Estes, & Scepan, 1999; Reed, 1997)."

We acquired the data in the Geographic Coordinate projection system, and reprojected it to Interrupted Goode Homolosine projection system. The MODIS land cover data were acquired from the Earth Observing System (EOS) Data Gateway, http://edcimswww.cr.usgs.gov/pub/imswelcome/ (last accessed 12 February 2004). The data, which are available in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), were downloaded as tiles in Interrupted Goode Homolosine projection system. The individual tiles were mosaicked together for global coverage using MODIS Reprojection Tool 3.0 (available at URL http://lpdaac2.usgs.gov/landdaac/tools/modis/index.asp ). We used the IGBP layer of the MODIS land cover which contains 17 land cover classes. The latter was aggregated into 17 classes to make it consistent with the MODIS land cover classification system. Global area totals were computed for aggregated land cover classes and also for the IGBP classes. Pixel-by-pixel comparisons also were performed between the generalized (with eight classes) GLC-2000 and MODIS land cover data. The percent agreement and disagreement were calculated using the following equations: Overall percent agreement = (Σr i=1 Xi Yi / C18/C19) × 100 and Overall percent disagreement = 1 - (Σr i=1 Xi Yi / C18/C19) × 100."
