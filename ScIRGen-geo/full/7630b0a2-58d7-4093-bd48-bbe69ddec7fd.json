            "description": "ChinaHighSO2 is one of the series of long-term, full-coverage, high-resolution, and high-quality datasets of ground-level air pollutants for China (i.e., ChinaHighAirPollutants, CHAP). It is generated from the big data (e.g., ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations) using artificial intelligence by considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of air pollution. This is the big data-derived seamless (spatial coverage = 100%) daily, monthly, and yearly 1 km (i.e., D1K, M1K, and Y1K) ground-level SO2 dataset in China from 2013 to present. Note that this dataset is 10 km before 2019, and improved to 1 km after 2019. This dataset yields a high quality with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) value of of 0.84 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 10.07 µg m-3 for the daily retrievals, respectively. Note that this dataset is continuously updated, and if you want to apply for more data or have any questions, please contact me (Email: weijing_rs@163.com; weijing@umd.edu). The data file contains four codes (Python, Matlab, IDL and R language) nc2geotiff codes for NC to GeoTiff.",
            "instructions": "File Name: The data is stored in the NetCDF file format, and the file name is CHAP_SO2_ab_yyyymmdd_V1.nc, where a represents time resolution (D represents daily data, M represents monthly data, Y represents annual data), b represents spatial resolution (1K represents 1km), yyyy represents year, mm represents month, and dd represents day. Data reading method: Python, Matlab, IDL, and other programming methods can be used to convert files from NC to TIF. The data coordinate system is WGS-1984, with a background value of 65535.",
