                "The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, known as the Asian Water Tower, has numerous lakes and is the source of many rivers providing precious water resources for human needs. On the one hand, the formation of water might be changing over a period, e.g., rainfall or snowmelt. Furthermore, the widely distributed glaciers and permafrost in this region have been influenced by climate change and the hydrological cycle appears to have been intensified, resulting in significant area changes of surface water. Previous studies on surface water mapping with 30-m spatial resolution have provided us with unprecedented information for understanding surface water dynamics. Yet, most of these studies extract water information based on one or more years of composite images, instead of benefiting from the whole time series. Mapping surface water from satellites is constrained by the spatial/temporal resolution and geographic/time scope. Studies have revealed that there is a trade-off between the temporal and spatial resolutions of the satellite sensors, with current noncommercial satellites offering either high temporal resolution images with coarse spatial resolution, or high spatial resolution images with sparse temporal resolution. Landsat has been a widely used data source for large-scale, refined, dynamic surface water mapping studies. Since the first sensor launched in 1972, Landsat has provided continuous Earth observations for almost 50 years, which makes it possible for long time series analysis. However, due to cloud contamination and instrumental defects, missing observations may result in uncertainties when using such Landsat images."

We developed some solutions for the problem of invalid observations (e.g., missing or negative data), at a finer temporal resolution, which greatly improved the accuracy of the classification results. We conducted a preliminary filtering that greatly reduced the amount of data and the computation cost. We used seasonal models that are stable and robust for the monthly surface water mapping.

Under global climate change, it is critical to understand the current influencing factors on surface water area in this region. Although there are numerous studies on surface water mapping, they are still limited by temporal/spatial resolution and record length. Moreover, the complicated topographic condition makes it challenging to map the surface water accurately. Surface water is a key part of the water cycle and plays an important role in keeping the balance between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Under the background of global climate change and human activities, surface water resources present different spatio-temporal trends.

In this work, we utilized all available Landsat data: Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images, from 2000 to 2020. All the image preprocessing was performed on the GEE cloud platform. Then, vegetation and water spectral indices were calculated based on the high-quality compositing image, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index with removing shadow pixels (AWEIsh). To improve classification efficiency and accuracy, a two-step classification framework was proposed for the surface water mapping, which is a combination of threshold filtering and RF classification. First, we draw the potential water extent based on spectral characteristics to exclude areas where there is nonwater with assurance. Then, RF method was used to obtain a more accurate water identification. Pixel-based supervised RF classification was conducted on the GEE."
