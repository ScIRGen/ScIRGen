            "description": "The data generated using a developed four-dimensional spatiotemporal deep forest model, constrained by the CHAP daily 1-km seamless PM2.5 dataset. This model integrates a high-density ground-based observation network of PM2.5 chemical components, as well as satellite remote sensing products, meteorological reanalysis, and model simulations, to construct conversion models between different chemical components and the total PM2.5 concentration. For the first time, it separates the daily seamless 1-km seamless satellite remote sensing products of four major inorganic chemical components of PM2.5 in China, including sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and chloride ions (Cl-). The ten-fold cross-validation determination coefficients (R2) between the estimated daily data of SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, and Cl- and ground observations are 0.74, 0.75, 0.71, and 0.66, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSE) are 6.0, 6.6, 4.3, and 2.3 µg/m3, respectively. The primary coverage is in eastern China, with a spatial resolution of 1 km, and temporal resolutions of daily, monthly, and yearly, measured in units of mg/m3. Note: This dataset is continuously updated. For additional data, please contact us via email at weijing_rs@163.com or weijing@umd.edu.",
