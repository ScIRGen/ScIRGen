            "description": "The data set contains the flux observation data of large aperture scintillator at areau station upstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network.Two large aperture scintillation devices of BLS450 and zzlas type were set up in the upstream areau station respectively. The north tower was the receiving end of zzlas and the transmitting end of BLS450, and the south tower was the transmitting end of zzlas and the receiving end of BLS450.The observation period of zzlas is January 1, solstice, December 31, 2015;The initial observation time of BLS450 was on January 13, 2015, solstice, March 16, 2015, and the observation time was on April 15, 2015, solstice, December 31, 2015.The station is located in the grass daban village, a soft township, qilian county, qinghai province.The latitude and longitude of the north tower is 100.4712e, 38.0568n, and the latitude and longitude of the south tower is 100.4572e, 38.0384 N, with an altitude of about 3033m.The effective height of the large aperture scintillator is 9.5m, the optical diameter length is 2390m, and the sampling frequency is 1min.\nLarge aperture flicker meter raw observation data for 1 min, data released for after processing and quality control of data, including sensible heat flux is mainly combined with the automatic meteorological station observation data, based on similarity theory alonzo mourning - Mr. Hoff is obtained by iterative calculation, the quality control of the main steps include: (1) excluding Cn2 reach saturation data (BLS450: Cn2 > 7.25 e-14, zzlas: Cn2 > 7.84 E - 14).(2) data with weak demodulation signal strength (BLS450: Average X Intensity<1000 (2015.1.13-2015.3.16) and Mininum X Intensity< 50 (2015.4.15-2015.12.31) were excluded.Zzlas: Demod>-20mv);(3) data at the time of precipitation were excluded;(4) data of weak turbulence under stable conditions were excluded (u* < 0.1m/s).In the iterative calculation process, for BLS450, Thiermann and Grassl(1992) stability universal function was selected.For zzlas, select Andreas 1988's stability universal function.Please refer to Liu et al(2011, 2013) for detailed introduction.\nSeveral notes on the released data :(1) the upstream LAS data is mainly BLS450, the missing time is supplemented by zzlas observation, and the missing time of both is marked by -6999.(2) data table head: Date/Time: Date/Time (format: yyyy/m/d h:mm), Cn2: structural parameters of air refraction index (unit: m-2/3), H_LAS: sensible heat flux (unit: W/m2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format, please refer to the references for details.\nPlease refer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al. (2011) for observation data processing.",

                    "Answer": "The quality control steps are essential to ensure the reliability of the observed data. By eliminating data with saturated Cn2 values and weak signal intensities, researchers can infer that these steps help maintain the accuracy of the flux measurements. The specified thresholds for Cn2 and signal intensity help in filtering out unreliable data, thus enhancing the overall quality and consistency of the dataset.",

                    "Answer": "Quality control steps are necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of hydrometeorological datasets. Inaccurate readings, such as those with weak demodulation signal intensity or those recorded during precipitation, can lead to errors in data interpretation. Weak signals may not accurately represent atmospheric conditions, while precipitation can interfere with certain measurements, such as those taken by large aperture scintillometers, affecting the derived sensible heat flux values.",

                    "Answer": "The main objective is to measure flux data, specifically the sensible heat flux, in high-altitude environments like alpine grasslands. The data aids in understanding atmospheric interactions by using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for iterative calculations, ensuring quality control by excluding saturated data, weak demodulation signals, precipitation, and weak turbulence conditions. Such accurate and controlled measurements provide insights into the hydrological and meteorological dynamics of these regions.",

                    "Answer": "The quality control procedures for data collected using large aperture scintillometers involve several key steps: (1) Removing data where the structure parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2) reaches saturation (BLS450: Cn2 > 7.25E-14, zzlas: Cn2 > 7.84E-14); (2) Excluding data with weak demodulation signal intensity (BLS450: Average X Intensity < 1000 for 2015.1.13-2015.3.16, Minimum X Intensity < 50 for 2015.4.15-2015.12.31; zzlas: Demod > -20mv); (3) Excluding data during precipitation events; (4) Removing data with weak turbulence under stable conditions (u* < 0.1m/s). The iterative calculation process selects the stability universal function by Thiermann and Grassl (1992) for the BLS450 and by Andreas (1988) for the zzlas. These steps are crucial for obtaining reliable and accurate sensible heat flux measurements.",
