            "description": "Freeze-thaw index is an important sensitive indicator of climate change, and is also widely used in the study of frozen soil changes. The research on the spatial distribution characteristics and time variation trend of freezing and thawing index in the global scope can provide a basis for the global frozen soil environment assessment, engineering construction and coping with climate change. This data set is based on the daily temperature observation data of more than 14000 stations covering the global land from 1973 to 2021 to calculate the air freezing index (FI) and air melting index (TI). The freezing/thawing index is the cumulative value of the daily average temperature below/above 0 ℃ during the freezing/thawing period. Considering that the index calculation should cover the whole freezing/thawing period and ensure the continuity of the calculation period, the northern hemisphere takes July 1 of that year to June 30 of the next year as a freezing period, and takes January 1 to December 30 of that year as a melting period, while the southern hemisphere has the opposite freezing/thawing period. The stations with missing survey years were not filled, which, on the one hand, avoided the uncertainty error caused by interpolation on the results, and on the other hand, retained the authenticity and accuracy of the data as much as possible. The study of global freeze-thaw index can effectively and comprehensively understand the near surface heat state, and can provide important support for exploring the changes of freeze-thaw state.",

                "Climate change is dramatically altering montane lakes and affecting species distributions (Hotaling et al., 2017). Montane lakes are considered to be great natural evolutionary laboratories because of their isolation and high endemism; this combination reduces confounding effects and, thus, makes evolutionary patterns easier to interpret (Salzburger, 2018; Whittaker et al., 2017). However, tens of thousands of montane or glacial lakes along the Alpine–Himalayan belt and Rocky Mountain ranges have been largely unexplored, and global biodiversity patterns in montane lakes remain relatively unknown. Climate warming has resulted in species homogenization and even extinction in these systems (Hotaling et al., 2017). As they are threatened by climate change, mountain lake systems have been considered to be extremely vulnerable centers of diversity for cold-adapted biotas (Herbert et al., 2016). Understanding the impact of past climate cooling on evolutionary history of montane-lake species may improve our ability to assess the threats to cold-water species posed by global warming. Global cooling took place from the Mid-Miocene to Pliocene, and intensified in the Pleistocene (Ho et al., 2019; Westerhold et al., 2020; Zachos et al., 2001). This cooling trend resulted in the separation of huge lake complexes along the Alpine–Himalayan belt (Neubauer et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2008) and isolation of lacustrine basins in the Rocky Mountain ranges (Galloway et al., 2011), leading to an increase in the number of montane lakes."

                "Genomic DNA was extracted from the legs of specimens using the Tiangen Genomic DNA kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. For the 203-tip data set, more conservative genes were used to resolve the deep evolutionary relationships of the family Gammaridae, including fragments of two mitochondrial genes (COI and 16S) and 10 nuclear genes (28S, 18S, EF1a, AK, PEPCK, HSP70, NaK, GAPDH, PDI, and H3). For the 567-tip data set, relatively fast-evolving genes were selected to demonstrate a clear chronosequence of divergence in biogeographic regions, including fragments of three mitochondrial genes (COI, COIII, and 16S) and five nuclear genes (28S, EF1a, AK, PEPCK, and HSP70). PCR products were sent to Sangon Biotech (Beijing) for bidirectional Sanger sequencing, then forward and reverse strands were edited and assembled into contigs using Squencher v4.2 (Gene Codes Corporation). Sequences were aligned for each gene independently using ClustalX v2.0.9 (Larkin et al., 2007) and manually adjusted in MacClade v4.06 (Maddison & Maddison, 2000). Maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were conducted for single gene and concatenated 203-tip and 567-tip data sets. A Bayesian inference (BI) tree was generated for the 203-tip dataset in MrBayes v3.2.1 (Ronquist et al., 2012). For the 567-tip dataset, Bayesian analysis failed to converge in MrBayes and so subsequent analyses were conducted using ExaBayes v1.5.1 (Aberer et al., 2014), which is designed specifically for large data sets."

                "We found that the species arose in Tian Shan in Central Asia and dispersed into montane lakes along the Alps, Himalayas, Tibet, East Asia, and the North American Rocky Mountain ranges, with accelerated diversification rates outside Tian Shan. Climatically suitable regions for geographic lineages of G. lacustris were larger during cooling periods (LGM), but smaller during warming periods (Mid-Holocene). In the future (2070) scenario, potential distributions in the Himalayas, North Tibet, South Tibet and North America are predicted to expand, whereas ranges in East Asia, Europe and Tian Shan will decline. Our results suggest that Mid-Miocene-to-Pleistocene continuous cooling promoted multiple independent dispersal events out of Tian Shan due to increased availability of montane lakes via “budding” of lineages. Montane lakes are conduits through which cold-adapted amphipods globally dispersed, dominating circumboreal lakes. However, future climate warming is likely to force organisms to shift upward in altitude and northward in latitude, leading to a future change in local populations."
