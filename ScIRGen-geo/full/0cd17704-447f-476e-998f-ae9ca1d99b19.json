            "description": "There is a growing demand for FVC products with high spatial and temporal resolutions in remote sensing applications. This dataset provides seamless fractional vegetation cover (FVC) over China at a 30-m resolution and semimonthly intervals in 2010-2022. Landsat datasets were employed to generate a continuous normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from 2010 to 2022. The NDVI was transformed to FVC using an improved vegetation index (VI)-based mixture model, which quantitatively calculated the pixelwise coefficients to transform the NDVI to FVC. Direct validation was conducted using ground measurements from croplands at the Huailai site and forests at the Saihanba site. Additionally, validation was performed with the FVC time series data observed at 151 plots in 22 small watersheds. The generated FVC showed a reasonable accuracy (RMSD values of less than 0.10 for the Huailai and Saihanba sites) and temporal trajectories that were similar to the field-measured FVC (RMSD values below 0.1 and R^2 values of approximately 0.9 for most small watersheds). A comparison between the generated FVC, the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC, and the GEOV3 FVC indicated consistent spatial patterns and temporal profiles, with an RMSD value near 0.1 and an R^2 value of approximately 0.8.

                    "Answer": "The method of generating 30m/15-day vegetation coverage data involves using Landsat series data with a harmonic model to construct a spatio-temporally continuous NDVI dataset, which is then converted to FVC using pixel-wise NDVI to FVC conversion coefficients. This approach is validated against ground-truth FVC measurements from different vegetation types and shows a RMSD lower than 0.1 with an R-square around 0.8, and similar time curves with RMSD lower than 0.1 and R-square close to 0.9 compared to ground measurements from 22 small watersheds. When cross-validated with other mainstream FVC products like GLASS FVC and GEOV3 FVC, it shows consistent spatio-temporal distribution patterns.",

This is evidenced by a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of less than 0.1 and an R-squared value around 0.8 when compared to ground-truth measurements from diverse vegetation types. Furthermore, cross-validation with mainstream vegetation coverage products indicates consistent spatial and temporal distribution patterns, enhancing confidence in the dataset's reliability.",

The dataset provides temporally continuous, high-resolution vegetation coverage data, which is crucial for accurate monitoring and analysis of vegetation dynamics over time. The dataset is particularly valuable due to its methodological approach, which involves using the pixel dichotomy model and harmonic modeling with Landsat series data to construct a consistent NDVI dataset, subsequently converted to vegetation coverage (FVC) data. This approach ensures that the dataset has a high temporal and spatial resolution, offering a reliable tool for researchers and policymakers to understand vegetation trends and changes accurately.",
