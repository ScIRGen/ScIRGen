            "description": "We proposed an automated global urban sample extraction method that includes multi-source sample refinement, local adaptive modeling, and spatiotemporal post-processing, to generate the 250-m global urban extent dataset MGUP (MODIS global urban extent product) from 2001 to 2018. The accuracy validation suggests that MGUP achieves good results across different years, cities of different levels, and continents, with a global F-Score of 88%. The comparison between existing products demonstrates the higher accuracy of MGUP, making it an improved version of existing MODIS-based urban products， and a reliable data source for monitoring global urban expansion.",
