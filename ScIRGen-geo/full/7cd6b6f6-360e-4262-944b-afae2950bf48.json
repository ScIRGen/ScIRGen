            "titleEn": "Ar ar age data of Muscovite in Hengdong cobalt deposit ,  Northeastern Hunan Province during Cretaceous",
            "description": "The content of the document includes ar ar age data of Muscovite in Hengdong cobalt deposit, Hunan Province. The experimental method is as follows: the selected sample is crushed into 60-80 mesh, then Muscovite is selected by hand under binocular microscope, and washed in ultrasonic bath with deionized water for 30 minutes. After the mineral separation was purified to 99%, the prepared Muscovite sample and the monitoring standard biotite zbh-25 (about 132.5 MA) were irradiated in 49-2 reactor of China Institute of atomic energy for 25 hours. After cooling for 3 months, the samples were analyzed by 40Ar-39Ar laser heating method. The correction factors for these values are: (39Ar / 37Ar) Ca = 0.000653, (36Ar / 37Ar) Ca = 0.000271, (40Ar / 39Ar) k = 0.00703. The total attenuation constant of 40K calculated by Steiger and Jager (1977) is used. Arcalc software was used to calculate and draw 40Ar / 39Ar results. The data can be used for geochemical analysis of Hengdong cobalt deposit in Hunan and similar deposits in Northeast Hunan.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored as a word document.",
