            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurement synchronizing with Landsat TM was obtained in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas on May 20, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) LAI in Yingke oasis maize field. The maximum leaf length and width of each alfalfa and barley were measured. Data were archived in Excel format.\n     (2) Reflectance spectra in Yingke oasis maize field by ASD FieldSpec (350-2500nm, the vertical canopy observation and the transect observation) from Institute of Remote Sensing Applications (CAS), and in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot by ASD FieldSpec (350-1603nm, the vertical observation and the transect observation for reaumuria soongorica and the bare land) from Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences. The grey board and the black and white cloth were also used for calibration spectrum. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro), and pre-processed data on reflectance were in Excel format.\n     (3) the radiative temperature by 3 handheld radiometers in Yingke oasis maize field (Institute of Remote Sensing Applications, BNU and Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources respectively, the vertical canopy observation and the transect observation), and by 3 handheld infrared thermometers in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot (the vertical vegetation and bare land observation). The data included raw data (in Word format), recorded data and the blackbody calibrated data (in Excel format).\n     (4) the radiative temperature of maize, wheat and the bare land of Yingke oasis maize field by ThermaCAM SC2000 (1.2m above the ground, FOV = 24°×18°). The data included raw data (read by ThermaCAM Researcher 2001), recorded data and the blackbody calibrated data (archived in Excel format).\n     (5) Photosynthesis of maize, wheat and the bare land of Yingke oasis maize field by LI6400, carried out according to WATER specifications. Raw data were archived in the user-defined format  (by notepat.exe) and processed data were in Excel format.\n     (6) Maize albedo by the shortwave radiometer in Yingke oasis maize field. R =10H (R for FOV radius; H for the probe height). Data were archived in Excel format.\n     (7) Atmospheric parameters in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot by CE318 (produced by CIMEL in France). The total optical depth, aerosol optical depth, Rayleigh scattering coefficient, column water vapor in 936 nm, particle size spectrum and phase function were then retrieved from these observations. The optical depth in 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm and 440nm were all acquired by CE318. Those data include the raw data in k7 format and can be opened by ASTPWin. ReadMe.txt is attached for detail. Processed data (after retrieval of the raw data) in Excel format are on optical depth, rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. \n     (8) Coverage fraction of Reaumuria soongorica by the self-made coverage instrument and the camera (2.5m-3.5m above the ground) in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot. Based on the length of the measuring tape and the bamboo pole, the size of the photo can be decided. GPS data was used for the location and the technology LAB was used to retieve the coverage fractionof the green vegetation. Besides, such related information as the surrounding environment was also recorded. Data included the vegetation iamge and coverage (by .exe).\n     (9) The radiative temperature of Reaumuria soongorica canopy and the bare land by 2 fixed automatic thermometers (FOV: 10°; emissivity: 0.95) in Huazhaizi desert No. 2 plot, observing straight downwards at intervals of 1s. Raw data, blackbody calibrated data and processed data were all archived in Excel format.",

In agricultural field measurements, LAI is determined by measuring the maximum length and width of each leaf of crops like corn and wheat using tools like tape measures and rulers. The actual leaf area is then calculated using a conversion coefficient obtained from scanning the real leaf area indoors. This data is typically stored in Excel format.",

                    "Question": "How can the use of different spectral devices and methodologies, such as ASD spectrometers and CE318 solar spectrophotometers, be interpreted in terms of their effectiveness in capturing comprehensive atmospheric and vegetation data?",
                    "Answer": "The use of different spectral devices allows for a diverse range of observations and data collection. For example, ASD spectrometers provide detailed spectral data for vegetation and soil, capturing information across broad wavelength ranges (350-2500nm for one device, 350-1603nm for another), which can be used to derive reflectance data. On the other hand, CE318 solar spectrophotometers focus on atmospheric parameters, measuring optical thickness and water vapor content across specific wavelengths (like 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm, and 440nm). The combination of these methodologies enables researchers to gather complementary data that can enhance the understanding of both terrestrial and atmospheric conditions.",

                    "Question": "What factors contribute to the variability in measurements when using different instruments for data collection in remote sensing experiments?",
                    "Answer": "The variability in measurements can arise from the use of different instruments such as ASD spectrometers, hand-held infrared thermometers, and thermal cameras, each with unique sampling methods, spectral ranges, and calibration processes. For example, the ASD spectrometer used in different locations had varying wavelength ranges and sampling approaches, potentially affecting the spectral data collected. Similarly, the calibration techniques, such as blackbody calibration for temperature data, can introduce variations depending on the device's specifications and the environmental conditions during data collection. Additionally, the measurement methods, such as vertical and strip observations for canopy data or the specific height settings for thermal cameras, might also contribute to variability in collected data.",

                    "Question": "What procedural steps are involved in using ASD spectrometers to gather spectral data for agricultural and desert observation sites, and how are these data subsequently processed?",
                    "Answer": "The procedural steps involve using ASD spectrometers to measure spectral data at agricultural sites like Yingke Oasis and desert sites such as Huazhaizi Desert. At the Yingke Oasis, the spectrometer from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is used to perform vertical canopy and strip observations, collecting data across a wavelength range of 350-2500nm. In the Huazhaizi Desert, a spectrometer from Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences is used with a wavelength range of 350-1603nm for vertical and strip observations of vegetation (red sand) and bare soil. The collected data are initially in ASD standard format and require ASD's ViewSpec software for viewing. The raw data are processed to obtain reflectance data, which are stored in Excel format.",
