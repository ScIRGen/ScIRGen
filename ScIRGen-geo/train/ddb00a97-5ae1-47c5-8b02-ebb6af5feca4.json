This dataset is in Excel format, and the original dataset is sourced from publicly published data from the National Bureau of Statistics, and a newly developed empirical mode. The entire dataset is displayed through Arcgis software. This dataset accurately estimates the nutrient supplies potential and gaseous pollutant emissions caused by different straw disposas. The results will serve as basic supports for researchers and policymakers involved in future agricultural efficient and cleaner wheat straw management in China.",
