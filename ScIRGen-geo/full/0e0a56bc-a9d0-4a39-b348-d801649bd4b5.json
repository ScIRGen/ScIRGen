            "description": "The long-term evolution of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) could be observed from Landsat series of satellite data since the 1970s. However, the seasonal cycles of lakes on the TP have received little attention due to high cloud contamination of the commonly-used optical images. In this study, for the first time, the seasonal cycle of lakes on the TP were detected using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with a high repeat cycle. A total of approximately 6000 Level-1 scenes were obtained that covered all large lakes (> 50 km2) in the study area. The images were extracted from stripmap (SM) and interferometric wide swath (IW) modes that had a pixel spacing of 40 m in the range and azimuth directions. The lake boundaries extracted from Sentinel-1 data using the algorithm developed in this study were in good agreement with in-situ measurements of lake shoreline, lake outlines delineated from the corresponding Landsat images in 2015 and lake levels for Qinghai Lake. Upon analysis, it was found that the seasonal cycles of lakes exhibited drastically different patterns across the TP. For example, large size lakes (> 100 km2) reached their peaks in August−September while lakes with areas of 50−100 km2 reached their peaks in early June−July. The peaks of seasonal cycles for endorheic lakes were more pronounced than those for exorheic lakes with flat peaks, and glacier-fed lakes with additional supplies of water exhibited delayed peaks in their seasonal cycles relative to those of non-glacier-fed lakes. Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as the westerlies, Indian summer monsoon, transition in between, and East Asian summer monsoon, were also found to affect the seasonal cycles of lakes. The results of this study suggest that Sentinel-1 SAR data are a powerful tool that can be used to fill gaps in intra-annual lake observations.",

                    "Answer": "Sentinel-1 SAR data allows for monitoring of lake area variations on a monthly scale, which is advantageous for studying seasonal changes, whereas optical remote sensing methods like Landsat are limited to annual scale due to high cloud cover. The SAR data provides the capability to observe under cloud cover, offering more frequent and reliable data for understanding seasonal dynamics. However, the accuracy of surface area measurement might differ due to the inherent differences in data capture methods between SAR and optical sensors.",

These atmospheric systems likely influence the timing and magnitude of lake area peaks, with larger lakes showing peak areas in August to September and smaller lakes in June to July. Furthermore, the influence of these patterns may vary depending on whether lakes are endorheic or exorheic and whether they are glacier-fed, with glacier-fed lakes showing delayed area peaks compared to non-glacier-fed lakes.",

Optical imagery is typically only useful for annual scale monitoring. Sentinel-1 SAR data, however, allows for the extraction of monthly scale lake areas, providing insights into seasonal variations. The SAR data is not affected by cloud cover, making it suitable for consistent monitoring in this region.",

This approach reveals distinct seasonal variation patterns for larger lakes (peaking in August-September) and smaller lakes (peaking in June-July), with more pronounced seasonal peaks in closed lakes compared to outflowing ones. Additionally, glacier-fed lakes exhibit delayed peak areas compared to non-glacier-fed lakes. Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the westerlies, Indian monsoon, and East Asian monsoon, also influence these seasonal changes, filling a gap in understanding intra-annual lake area variations.",

Sentinel-1 SAR data allows for the extraction of lake areas on a monthly scale and helps to understand different seasonal variation patterns among lakes, such as larger lakes peaking in area during August-September, and smaller lakes in June-July. It also differentiates the seasonal peaks between closed and open lakes, and highlights the delayed peak in glacier-fed lakes compared to non-glacier-fed lakes. Additionally, it considers the impact of large-scale atmospheric circulations like the westerlies, Indian Monsoon, and East Asian Monsoon on lake area changes, thus filling a gap in monitoring intra-annual lake area variations.",
