            "description": "In 2019, zircon sorting will be completed in Hebei Chengxin Service Co., Ltd., and the samples (5 kg ±) After cleaning and crushing, the samples were crushed to more than 80 mesh by conventional methods and separated by electromagnetic separation. Zircon particles with good crystal shape, transparency, no crack and large enough size were selected as test objects under binocular lens. Zircon target preparation and cathodoluminescence (CL) images were completed in Chongqing Yujin Technology Co., Ltd., which were placed in DevCon epoxy resin and polished to about half of zircon particle size after consolidation, so as to fully expose the interior of zircon. Zircon dating was carried out in the Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The instrument used was la-icp-ms. the instrument model was resolution M50 Agilent 7500a, and the manufacturer was Reynolds Agilent. The spot was 29 μ m。 He gas is used as the carrier of denudation material. Standard zircon plesovice (337.13 ± 0.37 Ma，Sl á 6) and Temora (416 ± 0 Ma, black et al., 2003), NIST srm610 as the external standard and 29Si as the internal standard (the SiO2 content in zircon is 32. 8%). The detailed analysis method is shown in Yuan et al. (2004); The method recommended by Andersen (2002) was used for common lead calibration; The isotopic ratios and REE contents of zircons were calculated by icpmsdatecal (Liu et al., 2010a; Li et al., 2010a; Li et al; Liu et al., 2010b). Isoplot 2006 (Ludwig, 2004) was used for age calculation and concordance mapping.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in accurately determining zircon ages using LA-ICP-MS can arise from factors such as the quality of zircon crystals selected for testing, including their clarity, crystalline structure, and size. The preparation process, including crushing, sieving, and magnetic separation, must ensure that the zircon grains are adequately exposed for analysis without contamination. Instrument calibration and the choice of standard references, such as Plesovice and Temora for age determination and NIST SRM610 for elemental content, are crucial for maintaining precision. The use of helium as a carrier gas and the precision of isotopic ratio calculations using ICPMSDATECAL can also affect accuracy, alongside the need for appropriate correction methods like those suggested by Andersen (2002) for common lead adjustments.",
