In this dataset, vegetation coverage is an evaluation index reflecting vegetation coverage. 0% means that there is no vegetation in the surface pixel, that is, bare land. The higher the value, the greater the vegetation coverage in the region. This data set includes the monthly synthesis of 30m*30m surface vegetation index products in Qilian mountain area in 2021. Max value composition (MVC) method was used to synthesize monthly FVC products on the surface using the reflectivity data of Landsat 8 and sentinel 2 channels from Red and NIR channels.",
