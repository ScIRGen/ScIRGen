            "description": "The No. 6 hydrological section is located at Gaoya Hydrological Station (100.433° E, 39.135° N, 1420 m a.s.l.) in the midstream of the Heihe River Basin, Zhangye city, Gansu Province. This hydrological section is for intercomparison of flow measurement between ADCP and manual method. The dataset contains recorded by the No. 6 hydrological section from 10 August, 2012 to 31 December, 2013. The width of this section is 58 meters. The water level was measured using an HOBO pressure range and the discharge was measured using cross-section reconnaissance by the StreamPro ADCP. The dataset includes the following parameters: water level (recorded every 30 minutes) and discharge. The missing and incorrect (outside the normal range) data were replaced with -6999.\nFor more information, please refer to Li et al. (2013) (for hydrometeorological observation network or sites information), He et al. (2016) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

This information is crucial for ecological and hydrological modeling and analysis, aiding in the understanding of river behavior in response to climatic and environmental changes. It also supports the development of water level-flow rate curves necessary for evaluating runoff variations.",

The data collection frequency can vary; for example, it was 30 minutes in 2012 and 60 minutes in 2013. Data processing includes creating a water level-flow curve to understand runoff changes and addressing missing data by using a placeholder string, such as -6999. The equipment is placed at specific observation points, and the data is recorded over defined periods, with some periods possibly missing due to equipment loss, as occurred between April 5 and September 6, 2013.",
