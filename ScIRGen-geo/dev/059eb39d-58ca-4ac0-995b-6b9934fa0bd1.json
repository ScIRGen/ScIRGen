Over the last 50 years, 60% of the worldwide ecosystem services degraded as a result of the global population increase and economic growth (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). The concept of the Anthropocene, which is a new era dominated by human activities, suggests that human beings are stewards of nature (Waters et al., 2016; Sanderson et al., 2002). Human has dramatically transformed the earth system (Braat and de Groot, 2012). The degradation of grassland, urbanization and conversion of wetlands to farmland caused by mining resource overexploitation, overgrazing and other high-intensity human activities have greatly changed the structure and function of the ecosystem and reduced the service supply (Darvill and Lindo, 2016). Considering the complexity and diversity of human activity, the human footprint index has wide applicability in quantitative evaluation of human activity (Li et al., 2014). Natural factors and human activities are two important driving forces affecting ecosystem services, the former belongs to the scope of macro-control (Song et al., 2015; Schröter et al., 2005), which can be evaluated but can’t be controlled."
