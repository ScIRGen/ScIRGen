            "description": "This dataset contains the automatic weather station (AWS) measurements from site No.3 in the flux observation matrix from 3 June to 18 September, 2012. The site (100.37634° E, 38.89053° N) was located in a cropland (maize surface) in Yingke irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1543.05 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity (HMP155; 5 m, towards north), rain gauge (TR525; 10 m), wind speed (010C; 10 m, towards north), a four-component radiometer (NR01; 6 m, towards south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, vertically downward), soil temperature profile (AV-10T; 0, -0.02, -0.04 m), soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.02, -0.04 m), and soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates with one below the vegetation and the other between plants, 0.06 m). \nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m and RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), precipitation (rain, mm), wind speed (Ws_10 m, m/s), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation; W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IR_2, ℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, below the vegetation; Gs_2 and Gs_3, W/m^2), soil temperature profile (Ts_0 cm, Ts_2 cm, Ts_4 cm, ℃), soil moisture profile (Ms_2 cm, Ms_4 cm, %).\n  The data processing and quality control steps were as follows. (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min; therefore, there were 144 records per day. The missing data were filled with -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) In this dataset, the time of 0:10 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:10; the data were stored in *.xlsx format. (5) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2016) (for multi-scale observation experiment or sites information), Xu et al. (2013) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

This matrix is used to collect data across different layers and components of an ecosystem, such as the atmosphere, soil, and vegetation, to understand processes like evapotranspiration over heterogeneous surfaces. The collected data undergo processing and quality control measures to ensure accuracy and consistency.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures for ensuring quality control of meteorological data include: (1) Ensuring the collection of 1440 data points daily (every 10 minutes) and marking missing data with -6999; (2) Removing any duplicate records; (3) Deleting data points that exceed physical meaning or instrument range; (4) Standardizing the format of date and time, with both in one column, for example, '2012-6-10 10:30'; (5) Applying a naming convention starting with 'AMS' followed by the station number.",

                    "Answer": "The measurement of multi-layer soil moisture and temperature in agricultural landscapes is enabled by the use of soil temperature probes and soil moisture sensors buried at various depths (0cm, 2cm, 4cm) below the surface. These sensors are placed strategically in relation to the meteorological tower to ensure accurate data collection.",
