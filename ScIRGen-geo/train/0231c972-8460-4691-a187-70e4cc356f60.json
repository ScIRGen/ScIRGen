            "description": "Qinghai Tibet Plateau is the largest permafrost area in the world. At present, some permafrost distribution maps have been compiled. However, due to the limited data sources, unclear standards, insufficient verification and lack of high-quality spatial data sets, there is great uncertainty in drawing Permafrost Distribution Maps on TP.\nBased on the improved medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) surface temperature (LSTS) model of 1 km clear sky mod11a2 (Terra MODIS) and myd11a2 (Aqua MODIS) product (reprocessing version 5) in 2003-2012, the data set simulates the distribution of permafrost and generates the permafrost map of Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The map was verified by field observation, soil moisture content and bulk density.\nPermafrost attributes mainly include: seasonally frozen ground, permafrost and unfrozen ground.\nThe data set provides more detailed data of Permafrost Distribution and basic data for the study of permafrost in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                "Permafrost, defined as ground that remains at or below 0 °C for at least 2 consecutive years (Dobinski, 2011), underlies more than 20 % of the exposed land area in the Northern Hemisphere (Obu et al., 2019) and constitutes an essential component of the Earth system. The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), also known as the Earth’s third pole, contains the largest mid- to low-latitude permafrost area in the world. Due to the complex topography and unique plateau climate, permafrost over the QTP is generally of low thermal stability and strongly influenced by complex local factors, such as terrain, vegetation cover, soil properties, and hydrological conditions, which differentiate it from high-latitude permafrost around the Arctic and make it more sensitive to global climate change (Li et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). In the context of global warming, significant permafrost degradation is occurring on the QTP and has strongly affected hydrological processes (Li et al., 2020), carbon cycling (Mu et al., 2020), and heat exchange processes (Zhao et al., 2020). In addition, hazards related to permafrost degradation threaten construction and infrastructure on the QTP (Wang et al., 2020). Many researchers have studied the complex responses and feedback of permafrost to climate change (Yang et al., 2019), while land surface model-based spatial modeling of permafrost has become an important approach (Ji et al., 2022). Using land surface models, many spatial modeling studies have attempted to project future changes in permafrost (Chang et al., 2018; Debolskiy et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021), assess the permafrost status under climate change (Koven et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2020), diagnose the contributors to regional permafrost degradation (Zhang et al., 2021a, b; Mekonnen et al., 2021), and project potential feedbacks on the climate system due to permafrost degradation (Zhang et al., 2020; Andresen et al., 2020; Yokohata et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). However, evaluating the spatial simulations for the QTP can be challenging due to the limited availability of ground observations, which may not be sufficient to serve as references across the vast spatial modeling domain. Hence, there is a need for an accurate permafrost distribution map that would serve as a reference to validate the results of spatial simulations. The map could be used as a target for the calibration of model parameters and to provide a constraint for future projections to minimize biases resulting from the modeling process. Moreover, an accurate map of permafrost distribution could serve as a fundamental dataset for hydrological, carbon, ecological, and engineering studies in cold regions (Hu et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; Mu et al., 2020)."

                "Based on these criteria, this study aims to produce a permafrost distribution map over the QTP in 2010 through an effective permafrost mapping approach that considers the effects of local factors and utilizes observational data, including remote sensing data and survey-based subregion permafrost maps, as optimization targets and constraints. Our objective is to provide a new reference map for 2010 for permafrost studies on the QTP and to provide a benchmark map for transient simulations of QTP permafrost under climate change."

            "challenges": [
                "Due to the scarcity of ground stations on the QTP, these modeling studies are often hampered by the lack of validation references, calibration targets, and model constraints; however, a high-quality permafrost distribution map would be a good option as a benchmark for spatial simulations. Existing permafrost distribution maps for the QTP can poorly serve this purpose. The accuracy of existing maps is constrained by the limited availability and quality of data used to create them as well as by the inadequacy of mapping approaches. Uncertainties associated with mapping approaches also negatively impact the accuracy of existing permafrost maps. Common statistical learning methods for permafrost mapping (Wang et al., 2019c; Ni et al., 2021) heavily rely on in situ observations as a training dataset. Therefore, they are often compromised when ground observations are unevenly distributed and have different observation periods, as is the case for the QTP. Meanwhile, the lack of accurate soil properties, fine-tuned parameterization schemes, and high-resolution forcing data on the QTP severely challenged the applications of land surface models in mapping permafrost (Wu et al., 2018). These physically explicit models were often calibrated and validated at a point scale, leading to unpredictable uncertainties when extended to a large region with more variability and, thus, more complex conditions (Qin et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018)."

                "In this study, we created a new permafrost distribution map for the QTP in 2010 using a novel permafrost mapping approach with satellite-derived ground surface thawing and freezing indices as inputs and survey-based subregion permafrost maps as constraints. We applied the FROSTNUM/COP mapping method developed by Hu et al. (2020) to map the distribution of permafrost on the QTP. The general process of this method and the improvements that we made in this study are outlined in Fig. 2. It is based on the extended ground surface frost number (FROSTNUM) model fed by satellite temperature data (Fig. 2a, b), and it requires permafrost distribution maps for subregions as optimization constraints. This method accounts for local factors through a model parameter E, whose values were optimally determined for all spatial units following a procedure of spatial clustering (Fig. 2c), parametric optimization (Fig. 2d), and decision tree (Fig. 2c). The optimization procedure in the original FROSTNUM/COP method uses Cohen’s kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) as an objective function, which measures the agreement of frozen-soil-type classification between the simulated map and survey-based subregion maps. In this study, we specially reduced the equifinality problem by modifying the objective function to additionally include a metric that guarantees boundary consistency and by introducing an ensemble simulation of 1000 runs of parametric optimization. DDF and DDT were calculated based on the MOD11A1 and MYD11A1 Level 3 products (Version 6). Despite many all-weather LST products (Zhang et al., 2021; Xu and Cheng, 2021), we chose a stepwise interpolation approach based on the solar–cloud–satellite geometry (SCSG) effect (Chen et al., 2023) to interpolate the data-gap regions in the MODIS LST data. Due to the buffering effect of seasonal snow cover and vegetation, thermal offsets often exist between satellite-derived LST values and GST values. Therefore, for the DDF values, we simply calculated the sum of negative degree-days of mean daily LST from four instantaneous LST observations, ignoring the effects of snow cover. To this end, we developed a multilinear regression model where GST is a function of independent variables including the raw LST, NDVI, and latitude at weather stations (Huang et al., 2020). The correction was repeated over 23 time intervals a year, and the annual DDT was the aggregate of all these corrected positive degree-days. We followed the method developed by Hu et al. (2020) to spatially group the soils of five subregions into soil clusters. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (Wang et al., 2018) was used to find the optimal value of E associated with each soil cluster."

Validations using survey-based subregion permafrost maps (κ=0.74) and borehole records (overall accuracy=0.85 and κ=0.43) showed a higher accuracy of this map compared with two other recent maps. Inspection of regions with obvious distinctions between the maps affirms that the permafrost distribution on this map is more realistic than that on the Zou et al. (2017) map. Given the demonstrated excellent accuracy, this map can serve as a benchmark map for constraining/validating land surface simulations on the QTP and as a historical reference for projecting future permafrost changes on the QTP in the context of global warming."
