                "The near-surface atmospheric elements including air temperature, pressure, relative humility, wind, precipitation and radiation are called forcing data to drive hydrological, land surface, and ecological models. Coupling or use of the General Circulation Model (GCM) output to drive the land surface model is an important source of forcing data for large-scale land surface models, however the spatial and temporal resolution can not meet the requirements of a regional scale land surface model and its coarse resolution ignored regional environmental impact assessment. Thus, a regional scale land surface model or land surface data assimilation system needs forcing data with a higher temporal-spatial resolution. Therefore, downscaling GCM output is necessary in order to prepare for a long series of high spatial and temporal resolution forcing data for regional scale or basin-scale land surface, hydrological and ecological simulation and assimilation. Downscaling is a method of obtaining high-resolution climate or climate change information from relatively coarse-resolution GCMs. Dynamic downscaling uses large scale climatic background information to establish higher resolution meteorological distribution fields by GCMs. Regional climate model is considered to be an effective dynamic downscaling method to derive high-resolution local climate information. The model’s physical meaning is clear, it is built on the nonlinear interaction between large scale and regional scale, and can distinguish local features characterized by local topography, vegetation cover and soil hydrological processes, and can be used anywhere independent of observation data with an improved description of local features."

                    "Answer": "The spatial and temporal resolution of meteorological datasets is crucial for accurately assessing regional environmental impacts. Coarse resolution, such as that from General Circulation Models (GCMs), often misses localized features and impacts, prompting the need for downscaling to achieve higher resolution. This allows regional scale models to better capture local topography, vegetation, soil hydrological processes, and other regional characteristics for more precise environmental assessments.",

Accurate validation against observed data helps verify the model's ability to simulate key atmospheric variables like temperature, pressure, and humidity. This is critical before using the model's output to drive hydrological and ecological simulations, as it ensures the data reflects real-world conditions and improves the accuracy of model predictions.",
