            "description": "Soil moisture (SM) is an essential state variable that plays an important role in the terrestrial water cycle, and plays an important role in many research and application fields such as land-atmosphere interactions, regional hydrological process, and water resources management. Global soil moisture products based on current passive microwave remote sensing are suffering from problems of spatiotemporal discontinuity (2-3 days revisit) and coarse spatial resolution (usually ≥ 0.25°), which limits its wider applications. We developed a machine learning based method to generate a global spatiotemporal continuous surface soil moisture (SSM) dataset with 1-km resolution from 2000 to 2020 on the basis of ESA Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) dataset. Firstly, the gaps in the surface soil moisture of ESA-CCI product are filled to obtain the global daily gap-free SSM data at 0.25° resolution by fusing the ESA-CCI SM product with the surface layer SM of the ERA5 reanalysis data. Secondly, a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) was constructed using in-situ soil moisture observations provided by the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and optical remote sensing data to disaggregate the gap-free SSM at 0.25° resolution to 1 km resolution, and then to generate a global spatiotemporally continuous surface soil moisture dataset at 1-kilometer resolution and daily step from 2000 to 2020. Verified by the in-situ measurements of SM at 2346 ground observation stations around the world, the results show that the product has good accuracy, with high R (0.89) and low ubRMSE (0.045 m3/m3). This is the first seamless 1-km resolution soil moisture dataset with long time-series at the global scale. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 1-km and a temporal resolution of daily/monthly with a unit of m3/m3. The data are stored as integer data type with a scaling factor of 0.001.",
            "instructions": "The monthly average soil moisture data is stored in GeoTIFF format and the file name is \"SM 1km.Month.YYYYMM.Global. v001.tif\", where \"YYYY\" represents the year and \"MM\" represents the month of the year, such as \"SM.1km.Month.201301.Global.v001.tif\" represents the GeoTIFF document to describe the average global soil moisture information in January 2013.\nThe daily soil moisture data are stored in h5 format with the MODIS grid tiles and projection (Sinusoidal grid projection), and the file name is “SM.1km.Daily.YYYY.tiles.v001. h5”, where “YYYY” represents the year and “tiles” represents the tile number, e.g. the “SM.1km.Daily.2013.h24v04.v001.h5” file contains daily soil moisture data of tile h24v04 in 2013.",

This integration overcomes limitations of coarse spatial resolution and temporal discontinuity found in mainstream products, enhancing the dataset's scientific application potential. The effectiveness of this approach is supported by validation results showing good accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and an unbiased root mean square error of 0.045 m3/m3, as verified by 2346 global ground observation sites.",
