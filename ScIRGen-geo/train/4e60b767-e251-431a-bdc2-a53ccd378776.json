            "description": "The land-sea thermal contrast is an important driver for monsoon interannual and interdecadal variability and the monsoon onset. The importance of the thermal contrast between the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Indian Ocean (IO) in driving the establishment of Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) has been recognized. The South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM) is primarily a tropical summer monsoon. As a direct dynamic response to the diabatic heating, the difference between upper and lower-layer winds can be closely linked to the strength of the heat source. The upper-layer thermal contrast is more important for the SASM (Sun et al., 2010; Sun and Ding，2011; Dai et al., 2013). Thermal contrast between the TP and the IO at the mid-upper troposphere is closely related to the onset and the variability of ISM. Considering that the temperature above the TP and IO are the two centers which are most sensitive to the change of ISM, a thermal contrast index (TCI) is proposed based on 500-200hPa air temperature:\nTCI = Nor[T(25°N-38°N, 65°E-95°E) - T(5°S-8°N, 65°E-95°E)]\nWhere Nor represents standardization and T is 500-200hPa air temperature. The TCI is larger, and the ISM is stronger.\nThe TCI can capture the interannual and interdecadal variability of ISM well. The cooperative thermal effect between TP and IO may contributes more to the ISM than the separately temperature of TP or IO. In addition, from the view of climate mean state, the pentad-by-pentad increment of TCI has a 15-pentad lead when the correlation coefficient between it and the ISM index reaches the maximum. And the correlation coefficient between the pentad-by-pentad increment of TCI and the ISM index is significant when the pentad-by-pentad increment of TCI has a 3-pentad lead. The result indicates the advantage of the TCI for prediction of the ISM. Meanwhile, the averaged pentad-by-pentad increment of TCI for the first 25 (TCI25) pentads may be a predictor of the early or late onset of the ISM. The ISM onset will be earlier when the TCI25 is larger.",

                    "Answer": "The method of defining the Tibetan Plateau and Indian Ocean thermal contrast index using 500-200hPa temperature fields is based on identifying the thermal contrast between the two regions, which is critical for understanding the onset and variability of the Indian summer monsoon. This approach uses standardized temperature differences at specific atmospheric pressure levels to capture thermal contrasts over time, offering a predictive advantage for monsoon intensity. Compared to other methods, such as using surface temperature differences or sea surface temperature anomalies, this approach may provide a more direct measure of the atmospheric conditions influencing monsoonal changes, as it focuses on mid-tropospheric thermal differences that are closely related to monsoon dynamics.",

                    "Answer": "The thermal contrast index (TCI) between the Tibetan Plateau and the Indian Ocean is closely related to the onset and interannual variability of the Indian summer monsoon. The data suggests that when the TCI is high, the strength of the subsequent Indian summer monsoon tends to be stronger. Moreover, the changes in TCI can predict the evolution of the Indian monsoon, as the incremental changes in TCI precede the Indian monsoon index changes by three pentads, with the strongest correlation observed when the TCI leads by fifteen pentads. Additionally, the average TCI increment over the preceding twenty-five pentads can provide predictive insights into the timing of the Indian monsoon onset.",

                    "Answer": "The underlying factors contributing to the development of the Tibetan Plateau and Indian Ocean thermal contrast index (TCI) include the significant thermal differences between the tropospheric middle and upper layers of the Tibetan Plateau and the tropical Indian Ocean. These thermal differences are closely related to the onset and interannual and decadal variability of the Indian summer monsoon. The temperature fields over the Tibetan Plateau (25°N-38°N, 65°E-95°E) and the tropical Indian Ocean (5°S-8°N, 65°E-95°E) are particularly sensitive to changes in the Indian summer monsoon, and the TCI is defined using the standardized temperature difference between these regions at the 500-200 hPa levels. This index provides better performance in reflecting the thermal contrast than considering the thermal conditions of the Tibetan Plateau or Indian Ocean separately, indicating that a higher TCI often correlates with a stronger subsequent Indian summer monsoon.",

                    "Answer": "Using a dataset that tracks the thermal contrast index (TCI) over multiple time scales, such as daily, monthly, and seasonal resolutions, can enhance the predictive accuracy of the Indian monsoon. This is because TCI effectively reflects the thermal differences between the Tibetan Plateau and the northern Indian Ocean across various time scales, providing insights into the strength and variability of the Indian summer monsoon. The TCI has shown to be superior when compared to using thermal conditions of the Tibetan Plateau or the Indian Ocean alone. Additionally, the daily increment of TCI provides predictive significance for the evolution of the Indian monsoon, with significant correlations beginning three pentads ahead of the Indian monsoon index and peaking at 15 pentads ahead. Furthermore, the average value of TCI increments over 25 pentads preceding monsoon onset can offer predictive insights into the timing of the monsoon's onset.",
