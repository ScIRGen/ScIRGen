The special survey of mining wells takes the irrigation area as a unit, uses hand-held GPS to locate the coordinates of the wells, and establishes the information card of mining wells through investigation and visit.  A total of 7,429 eyes of various wells were surveyed.  Among them, 6228 mining wells are still in use;  1201 wells were abandoned at the time of investigation.\n\nDescription of data content: The attribute table contains information of mining well number, coordinates, location, water intake purpose, mining well type, well depth at the time of investigation, pumping flow, annual mining volume, rated flow, quality evaluation, matching quality evaluation and comprehensive quality evaluation fields.",

                    "Answer": "'开采井专项调查' refers to a specialized survey conducted to collect data on the spatial distribution of extraction wells. This involves using handheld GPS devices to locate the coordinates of the wells and conducting interviews to gather detailed information, such as well numbers, coordinates, locations, water usage purposes, types of wells, depths at the time of survey, pumping flow rates, annual extraction volumes, rated flow rates, quality assessments, and comprehensive quality evaluations.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods using hand-held GPS involve coordinate positioning for wells, which provides a practical and efficient means of spatial data collection in field surveys. This approach might be less accurate compared to high-end GPS systems or remote sensing technologies but offers sufficient precision for large-scale surveys like the one conducted for the extraction wells in 张掖市. The method allows for on-site data verification and is cost-effective, especially when combined with manual surveys, as demonstrated by the integration of GPS and survey interviews to create well information cards.",

These goals are likely aimed at facilitating water resource management, ensuring sustainable extraction practices, and informing policy decisions. These objectives influence data collection methods by requiring precise location data, which is achieved through the use of handheld GPS devices, and comprehensive data on well types, usage, and extraction rates, which are gathered through detailed surveys and information cards.",
