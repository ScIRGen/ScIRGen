            "description": "This data set is the spatial distribution of soil POPs in the Tibetan Plateau, including OCPs, PCBs, PBDEs and PAHs. Fourty soil samples were taken from remote sites (i.e., away from towns, roads, or other human activity) in 8 soil zones of the Tibetan Plateau in 2007. The samples were collected using a stainless steel hand-held corer.Five cores (0-5 cm), taken over an area of ~100 m2, were bulked together to form one sample. The samples were wrapped in aluminum foil twice and sealed in two plastic bags to minimize the possibility for contamination. All the samples were analyzed at Key Laboratory of Tibetan Environment Changes and Land Surface Processes, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The samples were Soxhlet-extracted, purified on an aluminium/silica column (i.d. 8 mm), a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) column subsequently, and were detected on a gas chromatograph with an ion-trap mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Finnigan Trace GC/PolarisQ) operating under MS–MS mode. A CP-Sil 8CB capillary column (50 m ×0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used for OCPs, PCBs and PBDEs, and a DB-5MS column (60 m ×0.25mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used for PAHs. Procedural blanks were prepared. The recoveries ranged from 53% to 130% for OCPs, and 58% to 92% for PAHs. The reported concentrations were not corrected for recoveries.",

                    "Answer": "Collecting soil samples away from human activity areas is likely to enhance the accuracy and reliability of a dataset about persistent organic pollutants by reducing the influence of localized pollution sources such as roads, residential areas, and agricultural lands. This approach helps in obtaining a more representative assessment of the background levels of pollutants, minimizing the risk of contamination and providing a clearer understanding of the environmental baseline.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method involves collecting soil samples using a stainless steel spade from 0-5 cm surface soil layers in areas minimally impacted by human activities such as roads, residential areas, and farmlands. At each sampling site, five soil samples are collected within a 100 m2 area (one from the center and one from each corner) and mixed into a single sample. To minimize contamination, all soil samples are wrapped in two layers of aluminum foil and sealed in two layers of resealable bags. The analysis is conducted at a specialized laboratory, where samples undergo pretreatment steps including Soxhlet extraction, silica-alumina column purification, removal of high molecular impurities using a GPC column, and concentration for analysis. The analytical instrument used is a gas chromatograph/ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan-TRACE GC/PolarisQ), with specific chromatographic columns employed for separating OCPs, PCBs, and PAHs.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method involves using a stainless steel shovel to collect 0-5cm surface soil samples, avoiding human activity areas such as roads and farmlands. Samples are combined from five collection points within a 100 m2 area and are carefully wrapped in two layers of aluminum foil and sealed in two layers of self-sealing bags to prevent contamination. Analytical work is conducted at a specialized laboratory using gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry, with specific chromatographic columns for separating different pollutants, ensuring accurate analysis without sample contamination.",
