The samples were collected from pegmatite in the northern Tugemanbei Li-Be deposit, middle Altyn Tagh. U-Pb dating data of zircon, cassiterite, and niobate tantalite were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Among them, zircon U-Pb isotopic dating was completed in Wuhan Samplesolution Analysis Technology Co., Ltd., cassiterite U-Pb isotopic dating was completed in the Tianjin Center, China Geological Survey, and coltan U-Pb isotopic dating was completed in the State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, Nanjing University. The Ar-Ar radioisotope dating of muscovite was completed in Beijing Research Insitute of Uranium Geology, and the data were obtained by noble gas mass spectrometer. The age of pegmatite can be determined by the obtained data.",

                    "Question": "What are the expected advantages of using Ar-Ar isotopic dating on muscovite for determining the age of granitic pegmatite formations?",
                    "Answer": "Ar-Ar isotopic dating on muscovite can provide precise age constraints for granitic pegmatite formations. This method is well-suited for analyzing micas, as it exploits the decay of potassium to argon, helping to refine the age of metamorphic events and provide insights into the thermal history of the deposit, which is crucial for understanding the timing and conditions of pegmatite formation.",

                    "Answer": "The use of LA-ICP-MS for U-Pb isotopic dating in granitic pegmatite type rare-metal deposits is effective as it allows for precise measurements of isotopic ratios in minerals like zircon, cassiterite, and columbite-tantalite, as demonstrated by the data collected from the Altyn Tagh middle section of the Tugemanbei lithium-beryllium deposit.",
