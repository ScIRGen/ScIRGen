Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner has unlimited numbers of returns intensities measurements including the first, second ,third return intensities. The wavelength of laser light is 1064 nm. The relative flight altitude is 1500 m (the elevation of 2700 m) with the point cloud density 4 points per square meter. Airborne LiDAR-DEM and DSM data production were obtained through parameter calibration, automatic classification of point cloud density and manual editing.",

One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
