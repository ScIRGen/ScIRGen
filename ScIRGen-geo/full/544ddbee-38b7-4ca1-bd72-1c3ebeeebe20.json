            "description": "(1) This dataset is the carbon, water and heat flux data of alpine grassland and alpine wetland in Shenzha Station from 2019 to 2022, including net ecosystem productivity, ecosystem respiration, total primary productivity, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux and net radiation. (2) The data set is integrated by four eddy covariance systems, and the research objects are alpine steppe and alpine wetland. Among them, the distance between the two grazing exclusion-grazing pairing EC systems of alpine steppe and alpine wetland is about 380 m and 270 m respectively. (3) EC data sets all adopt internationally recognized data standard processing methods, the basic process includes: coordinate rotation -WPL correction - system self-heating correction - outlier removal - precipitation data removal at the same time, etc. Based on the previous research experience and consensus as well as the unique location characteristics of Shenzha alpine ecosystem, the following quality control standards are referred to (however, in view of the fact that nature does not develop smoothly, the principle of preserving as much original data as possible is adopted, and partial data retention is not forced to use these control standards) : data exceeded three times the standard deviation in a window of one day, data of quality control (0-1-2) as 2, and data of friction wind speed lower than threshold at night (0.1m/s in alpine steppe and 0.15m/s in alpine wetland). (4) This data set is has scientific value for understanding the carbon, water and heat effects of enclosure ecological engineering in alpine ecosystems, and can also be used for correction and verification of mechanism models.",

Both environments utilize similar data processing standards, such as coordinate rotation, WPL correction, and outlier removal, but the specific spacing and environmental conditions like friction wind speed thresholds differ between the two ecosystems.",

This can lead to a better understanding of ecosystem productivity, respiration, and energy balance. It also helps in assessing the impacts of grazing management on carbon sequestration and energy exchange processes in these ecosystems, providing insights into ecological restoration and management strategies.",

This includes analyzing parameters like net ecosystem productivity (NEP), ecosystem respiration (RE), gross primary productivity (GPP), latent and sensible heat fluxes, and net radiation. Such data are crucial for understanding the environmental dynamics of these ecosystems and can be used to correct and validate mechanistic models.",

The basic processing steps include coordinate rotation, WPL correction, system self-heating correction, outlier removal, and precipitation data alignment. Quality control measures include retaining as much original data as possible while applying standards such as removing data with more than three standard deviations in a day, excluding data with a quality control flag of 2, and discarding data with nighttime friction velocity below set thresholds (0.1m/s for grasslands and 0.15m/s for wetlands).",
