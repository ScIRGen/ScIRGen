            "description": "The dataset is global topographic factor (slope length and slope steepness factor, referred to as LS-factor) data, with a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second. The data source is mainly from the 1 ″ resolution  SRTM V3 Global 1-arcsec product. The global LS dataset is constructed by data preprocessing, blocking, adding buffer, and calculating topographic factors, clipping, and mosaic. Finally, the data dividing rules were based on the standard division of a 1:1 million measuring scale.  The final data resolution is 1 arc-second and is published in TIFF format. The data has been checked and confirmed to be complete, and the processing process ensures that the data accuracy is not reduced, which can meet the requirements of large-scale regional hydrological and soil erosion related analysis. The dataset can be applied to environmental science research, involving quantitative assessment of soil erosion, erosion terrain analysis, land hydrological analysis, quantitative simulation of surface process based on GIS, terrain analysis teaching, etc.",

                "Empirical soil erosion models continue to play an important role in soil conservation planning and environmental evaluations around the world. The effect of hillslope length on soil loss, often termed the slope length factor, is one of the main and most variable components of any empirical model. In the most widely used model, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), normalized soil loss, L, is expressed as a power function of slope length. In the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), the exponent, m, is defined as a continuous function of slope gradient and the expected ratio of rill to interrill erosion. Surface runoff rate is a critical variable in determining the rate of soil erosion and sediment transport. In process-based water erosion models, runoff rate is explicitly required in order to determine the rate of soil loss. For example, in the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP; Laflen et al., 1991; Flanagan and Nearing, 1995), which represents a new generation of process-based erosion models, the peak runoff rate is used to determine the rate of both interrill and rill erosion."

For these 200 runoff events for the four treatments, the model for runoff hydrographs worked well, with an average coefficient of efficiency of 0.90 and an average standard error of 0.88 mm h-1. A three-parameter infiltration and runoff routing model was developed and validated using data from bare plots from six sites in Southeast Asia and Australia (Yu et al., 1997b)."

For the data as a whole, the exponent did not increase as slope steepness increased from 20 to 60%. We also found that the value of m was greater for intense storms than for less intense storms. On average, runoff amount and peak runoff rate for the no tillage treatment were 37 and 44%, respectively, of those for the up- and down-slope cultivation.

Following this standard, current global DEMs contain artifacts, i.e., the data contain some extra information that does not match the actual mountainous, rugged landscape, flat or man-made terrain, such as random noise (due to the sudden change of terrain surface reflectivity) and systematic errors (due to the residual motion errors of the interferometry mast) during the satellite data acquisition process, which are specifically manifested as spikes, speckles and multidirectional stripe errors. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) opened worldwide downloads of one arc-second resolution SRTM DEM (SRTM 1) after 2015. These data have attracted much attention because of their superior resolution than the three-arc-second DEM (SRTM 3), providing a better and more accurate basis for terrain analysis and applications on a large global scale. SRTM 1, however, also has the problem of mixed errors. These inconsistent errors affect subsequent DEM-based research, so developing an error-elimination method compatible with the credibility and rigor of scientific research results suitable for DEMs is important."
