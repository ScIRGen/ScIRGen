            "description": "China's administrative regions are basically divided into three levels: provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government), counties (autonomous counties, cities), townships (nationality townships, towns). In order to meet the needs of user statistics and cartography, we have published 1:1 million national administrative division data sets according to the national basic geographic information center.\nThe administrative division data of Heihe River Basin were prepared. This data reflects the current situation of administrative divisions in Heihe River basin around 2008, including the information of provincial, regional and county-level administrative divisions. Its main attributes (such as area, code of administrative divisions, province (autonomous region), city (region, autonomous prefecture)) come from China's administrative divisions published in 2008.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity of collecting and preparing administrative boundary datasets in regions like the Heihe River Basin is influenced by the hierarchical nature of China's administrative divisions, which are split into three levels: provincial, county, and township. Challenges may arise from variations in the area, administrative codes, and affiliation to specific provinces or regions, as indicated by the data reflecting the administrative status around 2008. The preparation of such datasets often involves integrating information published by national geographic information centers and ensuring accuracy in reflecting the current administrative divisions.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing administrative boundary datasets from 2008 may lead to inaccuracies and reliability issues in contemporary studies due to potential changes in administrative boundaries over time. These changes might include reorganization of local governments, merging or splitting of administrative regions, and updates in administrative codes, which could result in discrepancies between the dataset and current conditions. This can affect the precision of geographic analyses, policy-making, and regional planning that rely on up-to-date administrative information.",
