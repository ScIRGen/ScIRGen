            "description": "This data set from paper “Monsoon affects the distribution of antibiotic resistome in Tibetan glaciers”. In this paper, ARG spatial distribution and influential factors were investigated in 85 samples from 21 Tibetan glaciers, covering snow, ice, and cryoconite habitats. Data set includd the 375 resistance gene subtype. The data showed that ARGs in snow exhibited biogeographic patterns influenced by atmospheric circulation. Specifically, monsoon-dominated glaciers exhibited a significantly higher abundance of ARGs than the westerly-dominated glaciers, which could be associated with higher antibiotic usage in the Indian subcontinent. In total, 1194 de-replicated MAGs were carried ARGs from all samples, 1098 MAGs carried multidrug-resistant ARGs. In total, 45 MAGs were identified as carrying both ARGs and VFs. They belonged to 28 genera, which carried 4.0% ARGs and 7.1% VFs in glaciers.To further evaluate the potential mobility of ARGs, the co-occurrence of MGEs and ARGs were investigated at MAGs level.  Our study suggests a greater risk of ARGs being released from the monsoon dominated glaciers, which were the glaciers that melt at high rates and thus need to be carefully monitored.",

                    "Answer": "The distribution patterns of resistant genes in glaciers influenced by monsoons show a significantly higher abundance in snow compared to glaciers influenced by westerlies. This difference may be attributed to the monsoon-affected glaciers receiving precipitation mainly influenced by the Indian monsoon, which correlates with the antibiotic usage in neighboring countries like India and Bangladesh.",

                    "Answer": "The analysis reveals that the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in glacier snow is significantly higher in areas influenced by monsoons compared to areas affected by westerlies. This suggests that the Indian monsoon, which affects glacial precipitation, plays a crucial role in the distribution and abundance of resistance genes. The correlation between antibiotic usage in countries influenced by the Indian monsoon and the abundance of these genes in glacier environments indicates that monsoon patterns may facilitate the spread of resistance genes to the Tibetan Plateau glacier habitats.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution patterns of antibiotic resistance genes in the glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau are influenced by the monsoon, which affects the abundance of these genes in glacier snow in monsoon-impacted regions compared to those influenced by westerlies. The study found a significant correlation between the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the glaciers and the amount of antibiotics used in surrounding countries like India and Bangladesh, suggesting that the extensive use of antibiotics in these regions may lead to the dissemination of resistance genes via the Indian monsoon to the Tibetan Plateau glaciers.",

                    "Answer": "Changes in monsoon patterns could impact the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in Tibetan glaciers, as the current abundance of these genes in monsoon-affected areas is linked to precipitation from regions with high antibiotic use. A shift in monsoon patterns might alter the spread and concentration of resistance genes, potentially reducing or increasing their presence depending on the new sources of atmospheric inputs.",

Additionally, the research aims to identify potential environmental transmission vectors, such as plasmids, that could facilitate the spread of resistance genes, particularly in regions affected by monsoons.",
