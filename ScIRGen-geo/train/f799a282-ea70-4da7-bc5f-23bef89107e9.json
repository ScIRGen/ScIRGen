            "description": "This dataset includes C, N isotope and radiocarbon dating data of human bones and animal bones from the West Zhou Cemetery in the southwest of Changzi, Shanxi Province. Stable isotope analysis of C and N was carried out at the Key Laboratory of Western Environment of the Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University, and radiocarbon dating was commissioned by Peking University. After the bone samples were pretreated, C and N stable isotope data were obtained by an automatic carbon and nitrogen analyzer connected to the Thermo Finnigan Flash DELTAplus XL mass spectrometer. Radiocarbon dating data was obtained through an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) test. It is inferred that during the period 1000-800 BC, humans buried in Western Zhou cemeteries in the southwest relied primarily on C4-based foods, with people of higher social status consuming more animal protein and possibly C3 crops. In addition, given the paleoclitic and other archaeological data in the Central Plains, human diet and survival strategies changed significantly during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC), with more C3 staple foods such as wheat being consumed, as evidenced by the increased intake of wheat by lower-status individuals and the development of a mixed wheat and millet agricultural system.",

Over time, especially during the Eastern Zhou period (770-221 BCE), there was a significant dietary shift towards more C3 staple foods, such as wheat, indicating changes in dietary practices and survival strategies. This is evidenced by the increased consumption of wheat by lower status individuals and the development of mixed agriculture systems of wheat and millet, reflecting broader societal and environmental transformations.",
