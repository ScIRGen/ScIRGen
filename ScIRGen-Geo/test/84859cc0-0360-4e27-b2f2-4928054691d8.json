            "description": "This data contains the grass production data of Sanjiangyuan from 2000 to 2016, in kg/(ha · a). By combining the distribution map of grassland types on a scale of 1: 1 million, taking into account the spatial distribution, climate factors, terrain and soil conditions of grassland types in the study area, as well as the distribution of sampling points, the grassland in the study area is divided into three grassland areas: alpine meadow, alpine grassland, and temperate grassland. Based on the established NDVI and the corresponding database of grass yield and dry weight, a grass yield estimation model combining ground remote sensing was constructed in different zones to obtain the grass yield. The Three Rivers Source Area is an important source of rivers in China. Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of grassland yield over the years in this area, exploring the relationship between grassland yield and other environmental factors, is of great significance for rational management of grasslands and guiding the development of animal husbandry in future climate change scenarios.",

                "The Three River Headwater Region is one of the source areas of China's major rivers. The grassland ecosystem is the most predominant ecosystem type in the Three River Headwater Region, covering about 65% of the total area. The protection of grassland ecosystems in the Three River Headwater Region not only affects the local ecological environment and livestock production but also has significant implications for water conservation, ecological security, and economic development in China and Southeast Asia. In recent decades, global climate change and human activities (such as overgrazing and the implementation of ecological protection and construction projects in the Three River Headwater Region) have directly or indirectly impacted the grassland productivity in the Three River Headwater Region. Due to the unique ecological environment of the Three River Headwater Region, current research on the ecological environment status, grassland degradation, and land use/cover change in the source area is abundant and relatively mature, but quantitative research on grassland productivity over many years in the source area is still insufficient. The overall trend of temperature in the Three River Headwater Region is increasing, and the response of grassland ecosystems to warming is relatively consistent, mainly manifested as an earlier start of the growing season, accelerated growth during the growing season, and an extended growing season. However, compared to temperature, the changes in precipitation patterns (such as spatial distribution of precipitation, seasonal distribution of precipitation, and interannual variation of precipitation) are much more complex, with greater spatial and temporal variability, and the trend of changes in precipitation patterns in the source area is still highly debated."

Then, we used these models to estimate the distribution of grassland yield in The Three River Headwater Region during 2006-2013.

The size of the grassland sample plots was 1m×1m, and the method of cutting at ground level was used to dry and weigh the grass samples within the plots, obtaining the dry weight of grass yield within the plots. The total number of sample plots obtained was 475. After strict screening and standardization of the sample plot data before modeling, the remaining sample plots can basically reflect the main grassland types and multi-year grass yield conditions of the representative areas of the sample plots.

The cumulative precipitation from October (previous year) to May in the current year was the main cause of inter-annual variations in grassland yield.

                "AnswerEn": "The challenges in conducting quantitative research on long-term grassland productivity in the Three River Headwater Region include the complex ecological environment, the variability in precipitation patterns, and the lack of sufficient historical quantitative data. Although there is abundant research on ecological status and grassland degradation, the unique environment makes it difficult to gather consistent long-term productivity data.",
                "AnswerCn": "在三江源地区进行长期草地生产力的定量研究面临的挑战包括复杂的生态环境、降水模式的变异性以及缺乏足够的历史定量数据。尽管关于生态状态和草地退化的研究很多，但独特的环境使得收集一致的长期生产力数据变得困难。",
