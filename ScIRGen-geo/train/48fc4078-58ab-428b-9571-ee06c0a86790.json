            "description": "According to the data of three future scenarios of CMIP5 (RCP2.6、RCP4.5、RCP8.5), the spatial variation characteristics and temporal variation trend of the global mean annual air temperature from 2006 to 2100 are analyzed. Under rcp2.6 scenario, the mean annual air temperature shows an increasing trend, with the growth rate ranging from 0.0 ° c/decade to 0.2 ° c/decade (P<0.05),  the growth in high latitude regions is faster, ranging from 0.1 ° c/decade to 0.2 ° C / decade. Based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the mean annual air temperature in the northern hemisphere in the 21st century, under different scenarios, the mean annual air temperature shows a warming trend, and the high latitudes show a more sensitive and rapid growth.",

                    "Answer": "The spatial distribution patterns of global annual average temperatures from 2006 to 2100, as derived from CMIP5 simulations under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, show a warming trend across all scenarios. In particular, high latitude regions exhibit a more sensitive and rapid increase in annual average temperatures, with growth rates between 0.1 °C/decade and 0.2 °C/decade under the RCP2.6 scenario. This suggests that data collection methods should focus on capturing regional variability and sensitivity, particularly in high latitude areas where the rate of temperature increase is more pronounced. This might involve enhancing the spatial resolution of climate models and incorporating regional climate processes to improve accuracy in these sensitive regions.",

                    "Answer": "The varying growth rates of annual mean temperatures under different climate scenarios, such as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, are influenced by several factors including greenhouse gas emissions, climate policies, and natural climate variability. These factors affect data collection methods as they necessitate the use of multi-model ensemble simulations to capture a range of possible outcomes. High-latitude regions, which show a more sensitive and rapid increase in temperature, require precise spatial distribution data and rigorous modeling techniques to accurately assess trends and changes.",

                    "Answer": "The analysis of multi-model ensemble simulations based on CMIP5 for different future scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) from 2006 to 2100 suggests that the accuracy of predicting global average temperature changes can be influenced by the scenario used. For instance, under the RCP2.6 scenario, the global annual average temperature demonstrates an increasing trend, with growth rates ranging from 0.0 °C/decade to 0.2 °C/decade, particularly showing faster increases in high latitude regions. This indicates that different scenarios can result in varying predictions, highlighting the importance of considering multiple scenarios for a comprehensive understanding of potential temperature changes.",

                    "Answer": "The ultimate goal of simulating the spatial distribution of global annual average temperatures under different climate scenarios is to understand the trends and changes in temperature patterns over time, particularly the warming trends observed in high-latitude regions. This information is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change and for informing policy decisions aimed at mitigating and adapting to these changes.",

                    "Answer": "Data collection methods suggest that under the RCP2.6 scenario, high-latitude regions exhibit faster temperature increases, ranging from 0.1 °C/decade to 0.2 °C/decade, compared to other areas. This could be due to the inherent sensitivity and rapid response of high-latitude climates to global warming.",
