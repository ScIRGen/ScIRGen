            "description": "Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a key nexus in the global surface energy exchange and water cycle, and spatial and temporal continuous ET estimates are of great significance for related studies. This dataset uses an improved ecohydrological model (SiTHv2) to estimate global daily terrestrial evapotranspiration. The forcing data mainly includes: 1) net radiation, 2) temperature, 3) precipitation, 4) air pressure, 5) leaf area index, and 6) land cover. After validation and comparison at the site scale (RMSE=0.66 mm/day), basin scale (RMSE=97.75 mm/year), and global scale (ranked well in the mainstream global ET products), the global ET estimates provided by this dataset performed reliably. This will provide necessary data support for ecohydrological related studies, such as land-atmosphere interaction, ecosystem water consumption, extreme climate events, and water resources management.",
            "instructions": "File name: ET data are stored in netCDF format, and the name of the file is \"SiTHv2.ET.Ayyyy.nc\", where yyyy represents the year. For example, SiTHv2.ET.A2001.nc means that this netCDF file describes the daily global land evapotranspiration in 2001. \nFile read: data is stored as int16 data type, which should be converted to float and then scaled by 0.01 to get the correct magnitude.",

                "Drought is recognized as one of the costliest natural disasters in the world, resulting in 55% of the economic losses caused by natural disasters. Based on an analysis of precipitation, streamflow, and drought indices, Dai indicated that the area of global drought has increased significantly since 1950 in many regions. Northern China, as the largest drought-prone region, experienced severe droughts during the second half of the twentieth century, and the most severe and prolonged droughts have occurred since 1990. Drought is a complex climate phenomenon that results mainly from a long-term deficiency in precipitation. Drought indices are a common way to identify drought events, and development of such an index for varied applications is essential to water resource prediction and management. Two prominent drought indices that have been widely used in climate and hydrology studies are (1) the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), based on the water balance equation, and (2) the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), based on a probabilistic precipitation approach. However, it is still difficult to establish a universal drought index that can monitor and identify all kinds of drought. The PDSI uses a water balance model to compute the cumulative moisture departure on the land surface. Although the PDSI is a physically based index, it still has several drawbacks, including mainly the use of an oversimplified two-layer bucket-type hydrological model that often unrealistically simulates the water balance components, a strong calibration influence that often generates unrepresentative model parameters, and fixed temporal scales. To improve on the PDSI drawback of a fixed temporal scale, a multiscalar drought index, the SPI, has been used to take into account the characteristics of drought at temporal scales varying from 1 month to several years. However, the main limitation of the SPI is that it is based on precipitation and ignores the effects of atmospheric water demand. In an effort to improve the SPI, Vicente-Serrano et al. recently developed the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which accounts for both water supply and demand and uses the difference between P and potential evapotranspiration (PE) to evaluate the water deficit or surplus."

                "Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a new physically based multiscalar drought index, the Standardized Moisture Anomaly Index (SZI), which is formulated based on the Z value from the PDSI and the probabilistic moisture approach of the SPEI. This new drought index combines the strengths of both the PDSI and SPEI."

                "However, the VIC model overestimated some peak flows. These errors could possibly be attributed to human soil and water conservation measures on the Loess Plateau, including check dams, fish-scale pits, and bench terraces, which tend to reduce the peak flows. There is a substantial lack of large-scale and long-term in situ observations of soil moisture. In addition, the satellite soil moisture data have an excellent spatial coverage, but their quality is still in question especially for the lower soil depths. Thus, validation of the model-simulated soil moisture with observations for our study region is difficult. The main limitation of the SZI is that its computation is more complex and difficult than the computation of the SPI and the SPEI. Another limitation of the SZI is that its calculation requires long-term climatic and hydrologic records, which makes it unsuitable for short-term drought identification."

                "In this work, version 4.1.1 of VIC was used to reconstruct daily water balance components and soil moisture values at a spatial resolution of 50 km, covering the entire Loess Plateau from 1 January 1971 to 31 December 2012. The VIC model divides the soil profile of the study area into three layers. The upper two soil layers of the model are designed to represent the dynamic response of soil to rainfall events, and the bottom layer is used to characterize the behavior of seasonal soil moisture. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient was employed to calibrate and validate the model. The observed streamflows from 11 key hydrometric stations were divided into two groups: (1) Lanzhou, Toudaoguai, Longmen, Tongguan, Huayuankou, and Huaxian for model calibration and (2) Hongqi, Baijiachuan, Hejin, Zhangjiashan, and Zhuangtou for model validation. In order to evaluate the performance and ability of the SZI, the drought identification results were compared with the VIC-PDSI and the other two most widely accepted multiscalar drought indices, the SPI and SPEI."

The observed monthly hydrologic data from 11 key gauge stations along the Yellow River were from the Hydrology Bureau of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission of China. The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) monthly soil moisture data set was used to evaluate the performance of the VIC model in simulating the soil water content. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, which were used to evaluate the performance of different drought indices, were from the NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer land data set at a spatial resolution of 8 km at 15 day intervals from January 1982 to December 2006."

                "Our evaluation indicates that the SZI accurately captures the onset, duration, and ending of a multiyear drought event through its multiscalar feature, while the PDSI, which lacks this feature, is often unable to describe the evolution of a multiyear drought event. In addition, the variability of the SZI is more consistent with observed streamflow and the satellite normalized difference vegetation index than that of the Standardized Precipitation Index and the SPEI. The improved drought quantification with the SZI is the result of a more reasonable estimation of water demand by including evapotranspiration, runoff, and any change in soil moisture storage. In general, our newly developed SZI is physically based and includes a multiscalar feature, which enables it to provide better information for drought monitoring and identification at different temporal scales."
