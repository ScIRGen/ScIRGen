      "description": "This data is monazite U-Pb age. The samples are collected from the light colored veins closely associated with the lead-zinc ore. after crushing, the heavy sand minerals are separated by manual elutriation. After magnetic separation and electromagnetic separation, monazite (about 500 grains) are picked out under binocular lens. After selecting representative monazite as target, the internal structure of monazite was studied by BSE through microscope transmission light and reflection light photography. U-Pb chronology was completed on 193 nm laser ablation system (new wave) and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS, Neptune) in the laboratory of Tianjin Institute of Geology and mineral resources. The average 206Pb / 238U surface age obtained from 21 survey points is 99.25 ± 0.78 MA (mswd = 1.60). This age represents the crystallization age of light vein closely related to lead-zinc mineralization. It is determined that the formation of the deposit is related to the hydrothermal solution in the late evolution of Cretaceous magmatic rocks. According to the comprehensive analysis of regional geochemical exploration and regional geological background, it is considered that the giant lead-zinc ore belt distributed in Tianshuihai Karakoram is controlled by Jurassic Cretaceous volcanic sedimentary basin and Cretaceous magmatic rocks. This metallogenic belt has great prospecting potential.",

        "AnswerEn": "U-Pb dating is a radiometric dating method used to determine the age of minerals by measuring the ratio of uranium isotopes (U) to lead isotopes (Pb) within a sample. In the context of geochronology, this method is applied to minerals such as monazite that contain uranium, using techniques like laser ablation and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) to accurately measure these isotopic ratios. The age is calculated based on the known decay rates of uranium isotopes to lead isotopes, providing insights into the crystallization age of the mineral, which can be associated with geological events such as ore formation.",

In the context of Xinjiang's Karakorum, the data indicates a crystallization age of 99.25±0.78 Ma, suggesting that the formation of the ore deposit is related to the late-stage evolution of Cretaceous magmatic rocks and associated hydrothermal activities. This relationship highlights the influence of regional Jurassic-Cretaceous volcanic-sedimentary basins and Cretaceous magmatism on the mineralization process, suggesting significant exploration potential in the region.",
