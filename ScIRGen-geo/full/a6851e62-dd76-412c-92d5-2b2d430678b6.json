            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of meteorological elements from the Huazhaizi Desert Steppe Station,,which is located along the middle reaches of the Heihe Hydro-meteorological Observation Network, and the data set covers data from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The station is located in Huazhaizi of Zhangye, Gansu Province. The underlying surface is piedmont desert. The latitude and longitude of the observation point is100.3186E, 38.7652N, and the altitude is 1731m. The observation instruments in Huazhaizi are installed respectively by Beijing Normal University and Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The observation instruments of Beijing Normal University are: two infrared thermometers installed 24 meters above the ground, facing south, with the probe vertical downward; soil temperature probes buried respectively at 0cm on the ground surface, 2cm、4cm、20cm、60cm and 100cmunder the ground; soil moisture sensors buried 4cm、20cm and 100cm under the ground; soil heat flow boards (3 pieces) buried 6cm under the ground. The observation instruments of Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute are: wind speed sensor erected 10.48m、0.98m and 2.99m above the ground(3 layers),facing North; wind direction sensor erected 4 meters above the ground; air temperature and relative humidity sensors erected 1m and 2.99m above the ground(2 layers),facing North East; four-component radiometer installed 2.5 meters above the ground, facing South; barometric pressure sensor placed in the water-proof box; tipping bucket rain gauge installed 0.7 meter above the ground; soil temperature probes buried 4cm、10cm、18cm、26cm、34cm、42cm and 50cmunder the ground; soil moisture sensors buried 2cm、10cm、18cm、26cm、34cm、42cm、50cm and 58cm under the ground, 3 sensors buried at 2cm.\nThe specific observation elements are as follows:\n(1) Observation elements of Beijing Normal University : surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit: Celsius), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watt / square meter), soil moisture (Ms_4cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_100cm) (unit: percentage) and soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_60cm, Ts_100cm) (unit: Celsius).\n(2) Observation elements of Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute: wind speed (WS_0.48m, WS_0.98m, WS_2.99m) (unit: m/s), wind direction (WD_4m) (unit: degree), four-component radiation (DR, UR , DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor) (unit: watt / square meter), air temperature and humidity (Ta_1m, Ta_2.99m, RH_1m, RH_2.99m) (unit: Celsius, percentage), air pressure (Press) (unit: hectopascal), precipitation (unit: mm), soil temperature (Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_18cm, Ts_26cm, Ts_34cm, Ts_42cm, Ts_50cm) (unit: Celsius), soil moisture (Ms_2cm_1, Ms_2cm_2, Ms_2cm_3, Ms_10cm, Ms_18cm, Ms_26cm, Ms_34cm, Ms_42cm, Ms_50cm, Ms_58cm) (unit: volumetric water content, percentage).\nThe observation elements of Beijing Normal University are 10-minute average data, and the observation elements of Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute are 30-minute average data.\nProcessing and quality control of observation data: (1) Ensure 144 data of Beijing Normal University per day (every 10 minutes), and 48 data of Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute per day (every 30 minutes). If there is missing data, it is marked as -6999. Data between 12.11-12.31,2014 is missing due to storage problems. (2) Eliminate moments with duplicate records; (3) Remove data that is significantly beyond physical meaning or beyond the measuring range of the instrument; (4) Data marked by red is debatable; (5) The formats of the date and time are uniform, and the date and time are in the same column. For example, the time is: 2014-6-10 10:30; (6) The naming rule is: AWS + site name.\nFor hydro-meteorological network or site information, please refer to Li et al. (2013). For observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2011).",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

The estimated E/ET% and E/ET% values agreed well with the values observed using the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes technique during the early, middle, and late growing seasons.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
