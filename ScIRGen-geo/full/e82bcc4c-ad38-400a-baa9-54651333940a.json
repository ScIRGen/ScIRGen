            "description": "This data is the estimation of mineral content, major and trace element composition of mantle peridotite, and the estimation of temperature and pressure of peridotite. The sample is lherzolite from basalt in Langshan area, northwest of North China Craton in 2019. The mineral content of peridotite was estimated by binocular microscope. The data of major and trace elements were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The estimated data of temperature and pressure of peridotite are calculated by mineral thermobarometer. The obtained data can reveal the lithospheric mantle properties and metasomatic process in northwest North China, and provide evidence for the lithospheric property transition and structural system transition in northwest North China.",
