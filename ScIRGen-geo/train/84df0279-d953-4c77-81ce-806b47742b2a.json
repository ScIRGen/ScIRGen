            "description": "This data set mainly includes the non-traditional Mg-K isotope data of potassic alkaline rocks and alkaline basalts in western Yunnan. This data is mainly used to study the fractionation mechanism of Mg and K isotopes during the evolution of alkaline magma and the tracing of ancient subduction recycled materials, which is of great significance to the study of the origin of potassic alkaline magmatic rocks and the study of crust mantle interaction. The Cenozoic potassic alkaline rocks are mainly from Zhuopan, Xiaojiluo and Nanbanqiao areas in western Yunnan, including 30 Mg test samples and 24 K test samples, excluding repeated sample testing. MC-ICP-MS is used for isotope analysis, and the testing unit is the Supergene Environmental Geochemistry Laboratory of China University of Geosciences (Beijing). Alkaline basalt samples are mainly from potassic rocks in Maliqing Jiangweitang and Midu areas in western Yunnan and basalts in Maguan, Pingbian and Ning'er Tongguan areas in southeastern Yunnan. Among them, there are 22 Mg test samples, excluding duplicate sample testing. MC-ICP-MS is used for Mg isotope analysis, XRF is used for Mg content analysis, and the testing units are Isotope Laboratory of Washington University and Supergene Environmental Geochemistry Laboratory of China University of Geosciences (Beijing). The above data have been received from articles (some of which have not yet been published), and the data are true and reliable. The obtained data can be applied to the study of unconventional isotopic fractionation and the genesis of magmatic rocks. The data results show that Mg isotope ratios of Cenozoic alkaline rocks and alkaline basalts in Sanjiang area（ δ 26Mg-DSM3) is -0.65 to+0.05 ‰. Most samples show higher values than normal mantle values, except for a few values that are slightly higher due to the influence of the general use of later hydrothermal fluids（ δ 26Mg=-0.25 ‰) lighter Mg isotope characteristics may be the result of recycling of carbonate rich subducted sediments. Compared with normal mantle（ δ 41K=-0.42 ‰) Cenozoic alkaline rocks in Sanjiang area have relatively heavier K isotopic composition（ δ 41K=-0.56 ‰ to+0.48 ‰), indicating the metasomatism of slab fluid to the overlying mantle wedge in the process of ancient subduction. These data indicate that Cenozoic lithospheric mantle in Sanjiang area is generally metasomatized by subducted slab fluid and carbonate components, and Mg-K isotope is a powerful means to trace the recycling of subducted materials.",

                    "Answer": "The 'Mg-K isotopic fractionation mechanism' refers to the process by which magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) isotopes are separated or distributed in different proportions during the evolution of alkaline magmas. This mechanism is significant for understanding the fractionation processes that occur during the formation and transformation of alkaline rocks, as well as for tracing recycled subducted materials. The analysis of Mg and K isotopes can provide insights into the interactions between crust and mantle materials, as well as the influence of subduction-related fluids and carbonates in the magmatic evolution of the region.",

                    "Answer": "The variation in Mg-K isotopic composition can suggest that the magmatic evolution and crust-mantle interactions in the region are influenced by the fractionation mechanisms of Mg and K isotopes during the evolution of alkaline magmas. Additionally, the lighter Mg isotopic characteristics compared to normal mantle values may indicate the recycling of carbonate-rich subducted sediments, while the heavier K isotopic compositions suggest the metasomatic processes involving slab-derived fluids affecting the overlying mantle wedge.",

Mg isotope samples are tested, with 30 samples for potassic rocks and 22 for basalts, while K isotope samples involve 24 tests. The analysis is conducted using MC-ICP-MS for isotopic compositions, and XRF for Mg content. The testing units are the Surface Environment Geochemistry Laboratory at China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and the Isotope Laboratory at Washington University. This methodological approach is crucial for understanding isotope fractionation mechanisms and the tracing of ancient subduction-recycled materials.",
