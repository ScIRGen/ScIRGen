            "description": "This data is the log data set of the meteorological tower in 2014-2018 in Laohugou base camp of Qilian Mountains. \"The 10 meter meteorological tower of Laohugou 12 glacier is located in the base camp, with an altitude of 4200 meters. Its observation elements include temperature, precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, air pressure, downward radiation, upward radiation, downward long wave radiation and upward long wave radiation, with a resolution of daily value. The meteorological instrument passes through China's meteorology After calibration and commissioning one belt, one road is connected with the CR1000 (Campbell), the -55 (CR1000) data collector. The data quality is complete. The data of many articles are all derived from this data. The Hexi Corridor nurtured by glacier water and melting glacier in Qilian Mountains is an important channel for the national strategic \"one belt and one road\". The study of its changes has great influence on Gansu, the whole country and the whole country. Therefore, this data has great research value and application value.\n\"",
