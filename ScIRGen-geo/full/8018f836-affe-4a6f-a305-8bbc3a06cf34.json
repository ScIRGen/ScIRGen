The site was chosen in A'rou (N39.06°, E100.44°, 3002m), Qilian county, Qinghai province. The data mainly included the raindrop grain size and the terminal velocity. Besides, dual polarized radar (X-band) parameters such as ZDR and KDR could be further developed based on those data.\n     The observation was carried out within an area of 5400mm^2; the liquid grain diameter was from 0.2-5mm, and the solid grain diameter was from 0.2-25mm.",
