            "description": "Observation time: 2008-06-05 ~ 2008-06-15.A sample strip with a length of 1Km and a width of 20m was set up to cross the super sample plot from the starting point of the super sample plot at the geantan forest station in ohnoguchi.The compass was used to determine the direction of the sample, and the azimuth was 115 degrees north by east, which was basically consistent with the flight route.20 meters ×20 meters of sample land shall be arranged every 50 meters in the sample belt, a total of 20 pieces of sample land.There is some overlap between the sample belt and the super sample land. The center of the no.1 sample land of the sample belt is located at the center of the super sample land. The observation data is shown in the measurement data set per wood of the super sample land.This data set records the observation data of sample 2 ~ 20.These data include the following three parts:\n1) tree data of sample plots: each wood of 2 ~ 20 plots was measured: chest diameter, tree height, crown width and undershoot height.Laser altimeter and ultrasonic altimeter were used to measure the height of big trees and under branches, flower rod was used to measure the height of small trees and under branches, chest diameter was used to measure the chest diameter of trees, and crown width was measured with a leather tape measure.\n2) sample location data: the sample location is roughly determined by using a tape measure and compass. The coordinates of the center point of the sample are accurately measured using the French THALES DGPS measurement system (model z-max).The observation method is to use two GPS receivers to conduct synchronous static measurement, one in the reference station and the other in the mobile station. The observation lasts 30 minutes. The data processing software provided by the system is used for post-processing difference.\n3) LAI observation data: LAI area index (LAI) of each sample plot was measured by lai-2000 and HemiView.",

Forest biomass is the energy basis and nutrient source for the functioning of the entire forest ecosystem, and it is fundamental for studying forest productivity, net primary productivity, carbon cycling, and global change research. Currently, the estimation of regional forest biomass mainly relies on extensive ground measurement plots established through stratified sampling techniques, followed by statistical methods for estimation. Methods based on radar and LiDAR have become a research hotspot both domestically and internationally. Traditional single-angle optical remote sensing data primarily provide spectral information and horizontal structural information of vegetation, lacking vertical structural information. As biomass increases, remote sensing signals are prone to saturation. Radar data with longer wavelengths can provide vertical structural information of vegetation; however, the acquisition of airborne and spaceborne polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar data remains quite challenging. The rapid development and commercialization of airborne systems currently offer a promising technological means for estimating forest parameters."

This is because the matched number of trees only accounts for a part of the total number of trees in the sample plot. Further research is needed to explore how to extend the application to regional-scale biomass estimation."

When generating the canopy height model, smoothing processing through low-pass filtering will change the number, values, and positions of the crown vertices. A new raster data smoothing algorithm is proposed for generating the canopy height model. Based on the linear and logarithmic optimal regression equations of individual tree structural parameters, the estimated growth equation for individual tree biomass is obtained by solving the coupled equations with the measured related growth equations."
