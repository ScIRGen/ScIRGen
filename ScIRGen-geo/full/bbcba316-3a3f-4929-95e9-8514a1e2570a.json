            "description": "The dataset includes OSL age, magnetic susceptibility and grain size data of KS16 loess profile in Yili Basin. The photoluminescence samples were collected at an interval of 10 cm in the soil layer and 20 cm in the loess layer. A total of 14 samples were collected. Environmental index measurement samples were collected every 2 cm, all samples were air-dried in the laboratory, and then the low and high frequency susceptibility was determined using an MS2B magnetization meter. The experiments were completed in the Key Laboratory of Western Environment of the Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University. This data can be used to reconstruct the Holocene precipitation changes, and the results show that the whole Holocene presents a wetter trend. Comparing with other loess profiles, it is found that there is no inverse pattern of precipitation/water vapor change between the eastern humid mountains and the arid basin in the arid central Asia.",
