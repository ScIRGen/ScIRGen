The analysis of major and trace elements was carried out in Guangzhou ALS laboratory group (a commercial ICP-MS analysis laboratory) by ICP-MS. RB, Sr, SM and Nd isotopic data were measured by MAT-262 mass spectrometer in the laboratory of chemical geodynamics, University of science and technology of China.\nThrough the above data, we can explore the influence of adakite on diagenesis and mineralization, and explain the process of mineralization in Anqing area.",
