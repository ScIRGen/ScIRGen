            "description": "This dataset is mainly composed of the thermal demagnetization results of the Late Eocene Lawula Group volcanic rocks in the Mangkang area of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. These results come from three sampling sections in the Mangkang area, including the Xuela (XL), the Lawu (LW), and the Lawu A (LWA). A total of 202 characteristic remanence directions were obtained from three sections after thermal demagnetization (from room temperature to 680 ℃) and linear fitting of demagnetization results. The results with maximum angular deviation (MAD) greater than 15 ° were excluded. By statistical analysis of these results, we can obtain the late Eocene paleomagnetic poles of the Mangkang area, and thus investigate the rotational deformation and paleolatitude shifting.",

                    "Answer": "Thermal demagnetization is a process used to remove secondary magnetization from rock samples by heating them to progressively higher temperatures. In the context of paleomagnetic data collection from volcanic rocks, it involves heating samples from room temperature to 680°C to isolate the primary or characteristic remanent magnetization. This method helps in obtaining reliable paleomagnetic data by excluding results with a maximum angular deviation greater than 15°, thus allowing researchers to analyze the ancient magnetic field directions preserved in rock samples.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods involved systematic thermal demagnetization, with temperatures ranging from room temperature to 680℃, and linear fitting of demagnetization results. The accuracy in determining paleolatitudinal changes and rotational deformation depends on the exclusion of results with a maximum angular deviation (MAD) greater than 15°, leading to 202 characteristic remanent magnetization directions across the three sections. This process ensures reliability in analyzing the paleomagnetic poles and subsequent geological interpretations for the Late Eocene period in the Mangkam area.",

                    "Answer": "The successful collection and analysis of paleomagnetic data from volcanic rocks in the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau during the late Eocene are influenced by systematic thermal demagnetization techniques, accurate linear fitting of demagnetization results, and the exclusion of results with a maximum angular deviation (MAD) greater than 15°. These steps ensure the reliability of the characteristic remanent magnetization directions obtained from the three profiles in the region, which are crucial for studying rotational deformation and paleolatitude changes since the late Eocene.",
