            "description": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used for monitoring vegetation. This dataset employed all available Landsat 5/7/8 data on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) (> 100,000 scenes), and reconstructed high spatiotemporal NDVI time-series data (30-m and 8-d) during 2000-2020 on the TP (QTP-NDVI30) by using the MODIS-Landsat fusion algorithm (gap filling and Savitzky–Golay filtering；GF-SG). For the details of GF-SG, please refer to Chen et al. (2021).\nThis dataset has been evaluated carefully. The quantitative assessments show that the reconstructed NDVI images have an average MAE value of 0.02, correlation coefficient of 0.96, and SSIM value of 0.94. We compared the reconstructed images in some typical areas with the PlanetScope 3-m images and found that the spatial details were well preserved by QTP-NDVI30.\nThe geographic coordinate system of this dataset is GCS_WGS_84. The spatial range covers the vegetation area of the QTP, which is defined as the areas with average NDVI during July- September larger than 0.15.",
            "instructions": "-The data of the same year was stored in the same folder, and the folder was named QTP_NDVI_XXXX(Year). The data were named by QTP_NDVI_XXXX(Year)_XX(Index).tiff, and the Index order corresponds to the date of the MOD09Q1 time series data of the current year.The data were in .tiff format, which can be read by software such as ENVI and ArcGIS. The NDVI time-series data in 2012 were not reconstructed due to the failure of Landsat 5. We will update the data after 2020 in the future.\nFor the use of this dataset,  please refer to the following citations:\n\n“The QTP-NDVI30 dataset (8-day and 30-m spatiotemporal resolution) was collected from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC) (Cao et al., 2022a). This dataset was generated through the fusion of MODIS (250 m) and Landsat (30 m) NDVI time-series data using the Gap Filling and Savitzky–Golay (GF-SG) fusion method (Chen et al., 2021), and showed satisfactory accuracy with visual inspection and quantitative assessments (Cao et al., 2022b)”.\n\nCao, R., Xu, Z., Chen, Y., Shen, M., Chen, J.

                "As the largest and highest alpine ecoregion in the world, the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is extremely sensitive to climate change and has experienced extraordinary warming during the past several decades; this has greatly affected various ecosystem processes in this region such as vegetation production and phenological change. The Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP), known as the third pole of the world, is the largest and highest alpine ecoregion. During the past few decades, the QTP has experienced rapid climate warming, with a rate of temperature increase two times the global average. The satellite-derived normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the most commonly used indicator for monitoring vegetation dynamics. Compared with other land-cover types, green vegetation displays higher reflectance in the near-infrared wavelength and lower reflectance in the red wavelength; thus, NDVI combines reflectance in the two wavelengths in a normalized form to enhance the contrast between green vegetation and other land-cover types. The continuous GIMMS NDVI and MODIS NDVI time-series data provide useful information to characterize intraseasonal greenness changes; however, the coarse pixel sizes (~8 km for GIMMS and 250 m for MODIS) impede vegetation monitoring in topographic regions."

In this study, we reconstructed high-spatiotemporal-resolution NDVI time-series data (30 m and 8 days) from 2000–2020 for the QTP through the fusion of 30 m Landsat and 250 m MODIS NDVI time-series with the GF-SG method."

                "However, the highest spatial resolution of only 250 m for the MODIS NDVI product cannot meet the requirement of vegetation monitoring in heterogeneous topographic areas. The area of the QTP is nearly 2.5 million km2; thus, reconstructing high-quality continuous Landsat NDVI time-series data for the entire QTP is a challenging objective; this is due to the vast amounts of Landsat imagery and data required for analyses, which cannot be obtained by most of the previous reconstruction methods. NDVI reconstruction in large areas may present various difficulties. For example, cloud removal on Landsat cloud images is easily affected by inaccurate cloud and cloud-shadow masks, and the performance of spatiotemporal data fusion highly depends on the availability of satisfactory Landsat images on the base dates."

In the first step, GF-SG fills the missing values in the original Landsat NDVI time-series data. In the second step of GF-SG, a weighted SG filter is used to smooth the synthesized NDVI time-series to reduce residual noise. We evaluated QTP-NDVI30 in three experiments. In the first experiment, we selected Landsat images obtained from July to September with cloud coverages less than 50% in 100 randomly determined subregions (30 km × 30 km) distributed relatively uniformly over the QTP. In the second experiment, 16 PlanetScope constellation multispectral images (3 m resolution) were collected at two test sites and were compared with QTP-NDVI30-based images. In the third experiment, we explored an application of QTP-NDVI30 to determine the vegetation green-up date (GUD) over the QTP."

The results show that the MAE averaged over the 100 subregions is approximately 0.02 and that the relative MAE is below 6%. The reconstructed Landsat NDVI images generally exhibit high spatial-structure similarity with the reference images, with average SSIM values above 0.94, indicating the satisfactory accuracy of the reconstructed Landsat NDVI time-series."
