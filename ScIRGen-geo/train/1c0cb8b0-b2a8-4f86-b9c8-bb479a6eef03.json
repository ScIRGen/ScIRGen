            "description": "The dataset of urban land and urbanization index on the Tibetan Plateau mainly includes the spatial distribution data of all urban land on the Tibetan Plateau (2019) and urbanization index of different scales (2018). The dataset of urban land was obtained by the visual interpretation of Google Earth images (2019), and the residential place and residential area data of \"1:250000 national basic geographic database - 2015 edition\". The dataset of urbanization index was based on the composite night light index (CNLI) at the regional, provincial, watershed, prefecture, and county scales calculated from the night light data of Luojia-1. Our dataset will support the study of optimizing the ecological security barrier system in the key urbanization areas of the Tibetan Plateau",
            "instructions": "Filename: the dataset of urban land on the Tibetan Plateau is stored in Shp format, and the dataset of urbanization index on the Tibetan Plateau is stored in Excel format. The dataset of urban land on the Tibetan Plateau is named as Built-upArea_ TP_ 2019。 Built-upArea represents the built-up area, TP represents Tibetan Plateau, and 2019 represents the year. The dataset of urbanization index on the Tibetan Plateau is named CNLI_ LJ1-01_ TP-2018, CNLI stands for the composite light index, LJ1-01 stands for the luojia-1 satellite, TP stands for the Tibetan Plateau, and 2018 represents the year.\nData reading method: the dataset of urban land on the Tibetan Plateau can be opened by ArcGIS, and the dataset of urbanization index can be opened by Excel.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is known as the “Roof of the World,” “Asian Water Tower,” and “Earth’s Third Pole,” which is an important ecological security barrier and a special cultural protection site in China, as well as a region affecting global sustainable development. Driven by the “development of western regions,” “new-type urbanization planning,” and the “Belt and Road initiative,” the TP is undergoing rapid socioeconomic development. Researchers have carried out several studies on the TP’s urbanization level at different scales. Nighttime light (NTL) data provide an effective way to quantify the TP’s urbanization level. Traditional NTL data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) reflect city lights as well as low-intensity lights from small human settlements, traffic flows, and can clearly distinguish the lights from rural backgrounds. Luojia 1-01 (LJ1-01) high-resolution NTL data provides a new source for quantifying the urbanization level on the TP because it compensates for the deficiencies of DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS data."

The built-up area data used to calculate the comprehensive urbanization level index were extracted from the global land cover data in 2017 in the FROM-GCL10 dataset, with a spatial resolution of 10 m and an overall accuracy of 72.8%. Digital elevation model (DEM) data used to analyze the influencing factors of the spatial pattern of urbanization level were obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The soil data were extracted from the soil map-based Harmonized World Soil Database (v1.2) of the National TP Data Center, with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The meteorological observation data were derived from the China Meteorological Data Service Centre, including the mean annual temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine hours data for 839 meteorological sites in China.
