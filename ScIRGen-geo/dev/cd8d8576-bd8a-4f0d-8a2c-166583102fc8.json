            "description": "This data is the U-Pb age of cassiterite. The samples were collected from cassiterite minerals in skarn type and quartz vein type ores in Songshan tin mine, western Yunnan. The U-Pb geochronology of cassiterite was studied by laser denudation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The 207Pb / 206Pb - 238U / 206Pb harmonic ages of the two cassiterite samples were 76.6 ± 1.5 Ma and 79.6 ± 3.6 Ma respectively, It shows that the tin mineralization of the Songshan tin deposit mainly occurred in the Late Cretaceous, which is obviously different from the emplacement time of Lincang granite (Triassic). Combined with geological characteristics and previous chronological results, this paper believes that there is an obvious tin mineralization event in the Late Cretaceous in this area. The next prospecting work in this area should focus on the contact zone between rock mass and surrounding rock, as well as the faults in the rock mass and surrounding rock.",

This technique involves micro-area in-situ analysis using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, allowing researchers to ascertain precise age measurements, such as the 207Pb/206Pb - 238U/206Pb concordant ages, to study the timing of mineralization events.",

                    "Answer": "The use of LA-ICP-MS for U-Pb isotopic dating in cassiterite mineral samples from skarn-type and quartz vein-type ores is necessitated by the need to accurately determine the age of mineralization events. This method allows for micro-area in-situ analysis, which is crucial for establishing the U-Pb ages of cassiterite samples, as it provides precise age data that indicate the Late Cretaceous period as the primary time of tin mineralization in the Songshan tin deposit. This is significant because it distinguishes the mineralization events from the emplacement of the Lincang granite body, which occurred during the Triassic period. Understanding these temporal differences guides exploration efforts by highlighting areas of interest such as the contact zones between rock bodies and surrounding rocks, as well as faults within these regions.",

The process includes using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to conduct micro-area in-situ U-Pb isotopic dating, which provides U-Pb age data for the cassiterite. Two cassiterite samples were analyzed for their 207Pb/206Pb - 238U/206Pb concordant ages, yielding results of 76.6 ± 1.5 Ma and 79.6 ± 3.6 Ma.
