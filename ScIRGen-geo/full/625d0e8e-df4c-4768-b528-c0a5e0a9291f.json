            "description": "The dataset of sun photometer observations was obtained in the Yingke oasis and Huazhaizi desert steppe foci experimental areas.\n     24 times observations were carried out by CE318 from BNU (at 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm and 440nm, and column water vapor by 936 nm data) and from Institute of Remote Sensing Applications, CAS (at 1640nm, 1020nm, 936nm, 870nm, 670nm, 550nm, 440nm, 380nm and 340nm, and column water vapor by 936 nm data) on May 20, 23, 25 and 27, Jun. 4, 6, 16, 20, 22, 23, 27 and 29, Jul. 1, 7 and 11, 2008. Those atmospheric measurements synchronized with airborne (i.e. WiDAS, OMIS) and spaceborne sensors (i.e. TM, ASTER,CHRIS and Hyperion)\n     Accuracy of CE318 could be influenced by local air pressure, instrument calibration parameters, and convertion factors. \n     (1) Most air pressure was derived from elevation-related empiricism, which was not reliable. For more accurate result, simultaneous data from the weather station are needed.\n     (2) Errors from instrument calibration parameters. Field calibration based on Langly or interior instrument calibrationcin the standard light is required.\n     (3) Convertion factors for retrieval of aerosol optical depth and the water vapor of the water vapor channel were also from empiricism, and need further checking. \n     Raw data were archived in k7 format and can be opened by ASTPWin. ReadMe.txt is attached for details. Preprocessed data (after retrieval of the raw data) in Excel format are on optical depth, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, the horizontal visibility, the near surface air temperature, the solar azimuth, zenith, solar distance correlation factors, and air column mass number. Langley was used for the instrument calibration.\n     Two parts are included in CE318 result data (see Geometric Positions and the Total Optical Depth of Each Channel and Rayleigh Scattering and Aerosol Optical Depth of Each Channel).",

                    "Question": "What procedural steps are involved in calibrating infrared temperature data and ensuring accurate atmospheric correction using solar spectrophotometer measurements in remote sensing experiments?",
                    "Answer": "Calibrating infrared temperature data requires identifying and applying appropriate calibration coefficients, which might be missing or incomplete, as noted with certain samples. For atmospheric correction, CE318 solar spectrophotometer measurements are crucial. These instruments measure direct solar radiation to derive optical thickness, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, and atmospheric water vapor content. Calibration of the spectrophotometer involves outdoor and indoor methods, using Langly principles under stable atmospheric conditions and standard light sources, respectively. Data preprocessing involves correcting for local atmospheric pressure and utilizing synchronized meteorological data to improve accuracy. The data is stored in a specific file format and processed to extract parameters such as optical thickness, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol optical depth, and atmospheric visibility.",
