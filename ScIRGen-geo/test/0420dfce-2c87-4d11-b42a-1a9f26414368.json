            "description": "Surface evapotranspiration (ET) is an important link of water cycle and energy transmission in the earth system. The accurate acquisition of ET is helpful to the study of global climate change, crop yield estimation, drought monitoring, and has important guiding significance for regional and even global water resources planning and management. With the development of remote sensing technology, remote sensing estimation of surface evapotranspiration has become an effective way to obtain regional and global evapotranspiration. At present, a variety of low and medium resolution surface evapotranspiration products have been produced and released in business. However, there are still many uncertainties in the model mechanism, input data, parameterization scheme of remote sensing estimation of surface evapotranspiration model. Therefore, it is necessary to use the real method. The accuracy of remote sensing estimation of evapotranspiration products was quantitatively evaluated by sex test. However, in the process of authenticity test, there is a problem of spatial scale mismatch between the remote sensing estimation value of surface evapotranspiration and the site observation value, so the key is to obtain the relative truth value of satellite pixel scale surface evapotranspiration.\n\nBased on the flux observation matrix of \"multi-scale observation experiment of non-uniform underlying surface evaporation\" in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin from June to September 2012, the stations 4 (Village), 5 (corn), 6 (corn), 7 (corn), 8 (corn), 11 (corn), 12 (corn), 13 (corn), 14 (corn), 15 (corn), 17 (orchard) and the lower reaches of January to December 2014 Oasis Populus euphratica forest station (Populus euphratica forest), mixed forest station (Tamarix / Populus euphratica), bare land station (bare land), farmland station (melon), sidaoqiao station (Tamarix) observation data (automatic meteorological station, eddy correlator, large aperture scintillation meter, etc.) are used as auxiliary data, and the high-resolution remote sensing data (surface temperature, vegetation index, net radiation, etc.) are used as auxiliary data. See Fig. 1 for the distribution map. Considering the land Through direct test and cross test, six scale expansion methods (area weight method, scale expansion method based on Priestley Taylor formula, unequal weight surface to surface regression Kriging method, artificial neural network, random forest, depth belief network) were compared and analyzed, and finally a comprehensive method (on the underlying surface) was optimized. The area weight method is used when the underlying surface is moderately inhomogeneous; the unequal weight surface to surface regression Kriging method is used when the underlying surface is moderately inhomogeneous; the random forest method is used when the underlying surface is highly inhomogeneous) to obtain the relative true value (spatial resolution of 1km) of the surface evapotranspiration pixel scale of MODIS satellite transit instantaneous / day in the middle and lower reaches of the flux observation matrix area respectively, and to observe through the scintillation with large aperture. The results show that the overall accuracy of the data set is good. The average absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the pixel scale relative truth instantaneous and day-to-day is 2.6% and 4.5% for the midstream satellite, and 9.7% and 12.7% for the downstream satellite, respectively. It can be used to verify other remote sensing products. The evapotranspiration data of the pixel can not only solve the problem of spatial mismatch between the remote sensing estimation value and the station observation value, but also represent the uncertainty of the verification process. For all site information and scale expansion methods, please refer to Li et al. (2018) and Liu et al. (2016), and for observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2016).",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."

Although there are many upscaling methods, most upscaling methods currently developed for ET are in the exploratory stage. Due to the heterogeneity of the underlying surfaces and the complexity of near-surface meteorological conditions, the applicability of different upscaling methods varies, and each method has cons and pros. Therefore, carrying out a comparative study of various upscaling methods is necessary in order to determine the most appropriate upscaling method over heterogeneous surfaces to obtain ground truth ET data at the satellite pixel scale and to reduce uncertainty due to spatial-scale mismatch in the validation process."

                    "Answer": "The current data collection methods, including flux observation matrices and high-resolution remote sensing, are effective to some extent in addressing the spatial-scale mismatch. However, the challenge remains significant due to the heterogeneity of subpixel variations, which impacts the validation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration data.",

These methods are compared through direct and cross-validation to determine which is most appropriate over different levels of surface heterogeneity. For example, area-weighted method is effective over homogeneous surfaces, while random forest performs better over highly heterogeneous surfaces.",

                    "Answer": "The major challenge in acquiring multiscale observations for eco-hydrological processes in heterogeneous landscapes is the poor availability of multiscale data. This is compounded by the spatial-scale mismatch between in situ observations and remotely sensed data. To address this, experiments like HiWATER use instrumentation on hierarchically nested scales, including flux observation matrices, eco-hydrological sensor networks, and hyper-resolution airborne remote sensing, to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes.",

                    "Answer": "The heterogeneity of the surface impacts the applicability of different upscaling methods because each method has varying strengths and weaknesses depending on the uniformity of the underlying surface. For instance, the area-weighted method is more suitable for homogeneous surfaces, whereas the weighted area-to-area regression kriging method is better for moderately heterogeneous surfaces, and the random forest method is more effective for highly heterogeneous surfaces. This variability requires a comparative study to determine the most appropriate method for obtaining accurate evapotranspiration data at the satellite pixel scale.",
