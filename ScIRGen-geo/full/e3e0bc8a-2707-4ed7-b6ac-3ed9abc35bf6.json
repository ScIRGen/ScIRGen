            "description": "Land surface hydrological modeling is sensitive to near-surface air temperature, which is especially true for the cryosphere. The lapse rate of near-surface air temperature is a critical parameter when interpolating air temperature from station data to gridded cells. To obtain spatially distributed, fine-resolution near-surface (2 m) air temperature in the mainland China, monthly air temperature from 553 Chinese national meteorological stations (with continuous data from 1962 to 2011) are divided into 24 regional groups to analyze spatiotemporal variations of lapse rate in relation to surface air temperature and relative humidity.\n\nThe results are as follows: (1) Evaluation of estimated lapse rate shows that the estimates are reasonable and useful for temperature-related analyses and modeling studies. (2) Lapse rates generally have a banded spatial distribution from southeast to northwest, with relatively large values on the Tibetan Plateau and in northeast China. The greatest spatial variability is in winter with a range of 0.3°C–0.9°C / 100m, accompanied by an inversion phenomenon in the northern Xinjiang Province. In addition, the lapse rates show a clear seasonal cycle. (3) The lapse rates maintain a consistently positive correlation with temperature in all seasons, and these correlations are more prevalent in the north and east. The lapse rates exhibit a negative relationship with relative humidity in all seasons, especially in the east. (4) Substantial regional differences in temporal lapse rate trends over the study period are identified. Increasing lapse rates are more pronounced in northern China, and decreasing trends are found in southwest China, which are more notable in winter. An overall increase of air temperature and regional variation of relative humidity together influenced the change of lapse rate.\n\nThe dataset is represented in an Execel document, the annual and seasonal air temperate lapse rates are included.",

                "Quantifying the spatial distribution of temperature, especially the relationship between temperature and altitude, is essential for understanding hydrological processes and their variabilities. This is because those processes are sensitive to air temperature, especially in cryospheric regions, where air temperature influences the melting of snow, glacier, and permafrost, and controls exchanges of energy and water fluxes between land and atmosphere. In land surface hydrological models, the standard procedure for temperature input is interpolation from limited meteorological stations to gridded cells that cover the watershed, which is often more important than other factors in those models in high mountain basins. Lapse rate is often used to interpolate from point measurements to the grids, which highlights the importance of realistic lapse rates in the prediction of air temperature. The commonly used method is use of a fixed adiabatic lapse rate in the range 0.60°C to 0.65°C · 100 m/C0 1 to create gridded temperature for hydrological models. This method is problematic, especially on glacier surfaces, because it implicitly assumes that terrain and surface processes are unimportant in determining surface temperature. This assumption is certainly not valid under real conditions. Near-surface temperature lapse rate varies on diurnal and seasonal time scales because of changes in sensible heat flux between the free atmosphere and underlying surface, and it also varies spatially depending on macro topography. Numerous studies have examined spatiotemporal variability of lapse rates over different regions. They all found that lapse rates are consistently weaker than the constant lapse rate as 0.65°C · 100 m/C0 1 and have significant spatial and temporal features. Similar spatiotemporal characteristics of lapse rates are found in the mainland China. However, very little has been done over the last two decades toward improving understanding of spatiotemporal variations of lapse rates in China."

Our analysis gives long-term statistics and considers the influence of two important factors (air temperature and relative humidity) on lapse rate. With denser station networks and longer observations compared with previous studies, we expect to achieve more reliable estimates of the lapse rate."

                "However, very little has been done over the last two decades toward improving understanding of spatiotemporal variations of lapse rates in China. One of the limitations is that the estimated lapse rates have variable reliability, depending on the density of meteorological stations. This density in China is not evenly distributed; there are fewer observations in the western part of the country, especially in certain mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau. This sampling problem certainly impacts the quality of the estimates in these regions. Another sampling problem is that there are few observations on the tops of mountains because of practical difficulties. This could make our estimates less representative for highly elevated areas."

The multiple linear regression method is adopted in our study, which includes the coactions of elevation, longitude, and latitude on lapse rate so that other factors (except elevation) such as latitude and continentality would not unduly influence lapse rate calculations. Lapse rates are estimated for each group using multiple linear regression by equation (1). The evaluation involves statistical comparison of the independent 201-station data (Tair) with the newly generated temperature (Tnew201) at the corresponding stations, using the estimated lapse rates and elevations of the stations for the period January 1962 to December 2011."

Ultimately, data from 553 stations, continuous from January 1962 to December 2011, were used in the estimation. The remaining discontinuous data set of 201 stations were used to independently validate accuracy of the estimated lapse rates."

                    "Answer": "Accurately determining lapse rates in high mountain basins using traditional methods is challenging because these methods often rely on a fixed adiabatic lapse rate, which assumes that terrain and surface processes are unimportant in determining surface temperature. This assumption is invalid under real conditions, as near-surface temperature lapse rates vary with diurnal and seasonal changes and are influenced by macro topography.",

The spatial variability is also influenced by macro topography and the relationship between air temperature and relative humidity, which affects lapse rates.",

This is especially important in cryospheric regions, where air temperature influences the melting of snow, glaciers, and permafrost, and controls exchanges of energy and water fluxes between land and atmosphere.",

This impacts the quality of estimates in these regions. Addressing these challenges is significant because it improves the reliability of lapse rate estimates, which are crucial for accurate environmental and climatic modeling.",

The multiple linear regression method considers elevation, longitude, and latitude to account for factors influencing lapse rate calculations.",
