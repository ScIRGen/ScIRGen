            "description": "This data is the simulated data of glacier distribution in the alpine region of Asia since the last glacial maximum, It includes the annual resolution glacier area change sequence of typical regions (High mountain Asia, Tianshan Mountains, Himalayas and Pamir Plateau) and typical periods (LGM (20000 ~ 19000ka), HS1 (17000 ~ 16000ka), BA (~ 14900 ~ 14350ka), yd (12900 ~ 12000ka), eh (9500 ~ 8500ka), MH (6500 ~ 5500ka), LH (3500 ~ 2500ka) and modern (1951 ~ 1990)) 1 km resolution glacier distribution in High Mountain Asia. This data are created by taking the trace full forcing simulation based on ccsm3 climate model as the external forcing field to drive the 1 km resolution PISM ice sheet model. This data can be used to study the changes of glacier distribution in the alpine region of Asia since the last glacial maximum and its impact on environmental and climatic factors such as lake water level, runoff and landform.",
            "instructions": "The glacier area data is stored in Excel format, in which the time yyyyy represents years ago (relative to 1950)\nGlacier distribution is stored in NetCDF file, which can be opened, viewed and analyzed by CDO or NCL professional meteorological data processing or mapping software.",

This level of detail allows for a more refined understanding of glacier dynamics and their environmental impacts, such as changes in lake water levels, runoff, and geomorphological features post-LGM in high Asian mountain areas.",
