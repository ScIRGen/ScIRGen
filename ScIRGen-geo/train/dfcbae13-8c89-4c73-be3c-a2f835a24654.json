            "description": "The oasis-desert ecosystem is a unique landscape in arid/semi-arid regions, and the observation and research of its water vapor, heat, and carbon fluxes are of great significance to the stability and sustainable development of oasis. This dataset contains data on water vapor, heat, carbon flux, and meteorological elements in the Zhangye oasis-desert region in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin from May to September 2012. There are 21 observation points in the two nested matrices (30 km × 30 km and 5.5 km ×5.5 km), which include a total of 22 sets of eddy covariance systems (EC), 21 automatic weather stations (AWS), 4 sets of large aperture scintillometers (LAS), and 3 sets of thermal dissipation probe (TDP). All the data have been processed carefully, and can be used to study the characteristics and impact mechanisms of water vapor, heat, and carbon changes in oasis desert regions, and can provide a strong data foundation for model simulation or remote sensing estimation results.\n\nThe observation matrix dataset of water, heat, carbon flux, and meteorological elements in the Zhangye oasis desert region is a list file of 48 observation datasets. The list file includes  the name, DOI, and corresponding address of 22 eddy covariance systems, 21 automatic meteorological stations, 4 large aperture scintillometers, and 1 thermal dissipation probe.\nThe observation items include ecosystem net carbon exchange, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, downward/upward short wave radiation, downward/upward long wave radiation, net radiation, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, infrared radiation temperature, photosynthetic effective radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil heat flux and average soil temperature, tree transpiration, etc.",

This approach allows for the comprehensive monitoring of fluxes and meteorological factors across various locations, enhancing the understanding of spatial variations and interactions within these ecosystems. It provides reliable data for analyzing changes in flux characteristics and mechanisms, supporting sustainable development and stabilization efforts in arid and semi-arid regions.",

These fluxes, measured through methods such as eddy covariance and automatic meteorological stations, help in understanding the variations and interactions between different environmental factors. The patterns observed can indicate the ecosystem's response to climate variables and anthropogenic impacts, which is crucial for modeling and predicting future ecological scenarios. Furthermore, the data helps in validating remote sensing estimations and improving predictive models for ecosystem management.",
