            "description": "This data includes the data of major and trace elements of beryl. The major elements of beryl are obtained by electron microprobe analysis, and the trace elements of beryl are obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Based on the data obtained through analysis in Cuona and Everest areas of this belt, this paper summarizes the physical and chemical conditions for the formation of beryl deposits, defines the mineralogical classification and chemical characteristics of beryl in these areas, and discriminates the indicative significance of beryl in these areas for diagenesis and mineralization. At the same time, by comparing the contents of CS / Na and Mg / Fe in beryl in various regions, its evolution degree and its correlation with hydrothermal activities are proved, which reflects the lithium metallogenic potential in Kuqu area.",
