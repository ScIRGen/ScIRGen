Based on airborne LIDAR data processing, the land surface DEM, DSM and point cloud density map were generated. By subtracting DSM and DEM directly, a Vegetation height product in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin was obtained. The product overall accuracy is 88%.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."

LSE reflecting the land surface emission feature is widely applied in geological research, mineral mapping and so on. Quantitative remote sensing inversion is an important approach to retrieve LST&E on regional and global scale. As the multi-spectral and hyperspectral thermal infrared sensors appear, deriving the LST&E simultaneously becomes possible. Except for the space-borne sensors such as MODIS and ASTER, various airborne multispectral and hyperspectral thermal infrared sensors play important role on regional survey and scientific research for their flexibility and finer spatial resolution. At the same time, algorithms for extracting LST/LSE information from the data collected by these airborne sensors have been subsequently proposed and yielded satisfactory result. However, the emissivity validation using in situ data has been barely presented. TASI is a new generation of commercial hyperspectral infrared sensors released by ITRES, Canada in 2006, aiming to the detection of land surface temperature and emission characteristics and applications like mineral mapping, land mining and gas exploration."
