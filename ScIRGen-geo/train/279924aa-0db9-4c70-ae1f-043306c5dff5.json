            "description": "The daily High spatial resolution human Thermal Index Collection over the North China Plain (HiTIC-NCP) includes near-surface air temperature (SAT) and 11 commonly used human-perceived temperature indices: indoor Apparent Temperature (ATin), outdoor shaded Apparent Temperature (ATout), Discomfort Index (DI), Effective Temperature (ET), Heat Index (HI), Humidex (HMI), Modified Discomfort Index (MDI), Net Effective Temperature (NET), Wet-Bulb Temperature (WBT), simplified Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (sWBGT), and Wind Chill Temperature (WCT). This daily dataset has a high spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and covers the North China Plain from January 2003 to December 2020. It has high accuracy with averaged determination coefficient, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error of 0.987, 0.970 °C, and 1.292 °C, respectively. The dataset is stacked by year and each stack consists of 365 daily images in NetCDF format by day of the year. The unit of the dataset is 0.01 degree Celsius (°C), and the values are stored in an integer type (Int16) to save storage space, and thus need to be divided by 100 to get the values in degree Celcius when in use. The geographic coordinate system of the dataset is World Geodetic System (WGS) 1984 Coordinate System. If you have any questions when using the HiTIC-NCP dataset, please feel free to contact Mr. Xiang Li via lixiang97@mail2.sysu.edu.cn, Dr. Ming Luo via luom38@mail.sysu.edu.cn, or Dr. Yongquan Zhao via yqzhao@link.cuhk.edu.hk.
