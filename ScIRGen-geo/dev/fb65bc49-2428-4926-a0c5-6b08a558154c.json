The observation site was covered with dry pasture with height less than 5cm, in which the center point of each grid was measured twice and was named in the form of A3-9 (number 9 point in No. 3 quadrate of A'rou). \n     Each measurement was carried out at 45° and followed strictly the order: Tsky, Tcha, Tsm and Tcm. Meanwhile, the surface temperature was also acquired by the handheld infrared thermometer and the thermal imager (FLIR ThermaCAM). [emissivity=1- (Tcm^4 – Tsm^4)/ (Tcha^4 – Tsky^4)]. Those provide reliable data for retrieval and study of the surface temperature, and energy and radiation balance.",
