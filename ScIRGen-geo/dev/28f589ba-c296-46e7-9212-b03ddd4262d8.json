            "description": "Combined with the analysis results of major and trace elements and Sr nd Pb isotopic compositions of the whole rock, this paper studies the composition of the primary magma of Mesozoic basalts in the North Daxinganling area, traces the composition and properties of the magma source area, and probes into the deep dynamic mechanism of magma formation. All the experiments were carried out in the State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The whole rock was determined by rigakurix2000 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF). The analysis accuracy of SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, Cao, Na2O and K2O is better than 3%; TiO2, MnO and P2O5 are better than 5%. X Series 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to analyze trace elements in the whole rock. The accuracy of most trace elements is better than 5%.",
