      "description": "This data set contains the observation data of vortex correlativity instrument at yakou station, upstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.The station is located in qilian county, qinghai province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 100.2421, 38.0142N, and the altitude is 4148 m.The height of the vortex correlation instrument is 3.2m, the sampling frequency is 10Hz, the ultrasonic direction is due to the north, and the distance between the ultrasonic wind speed and temperature instrument (CSAT3) and the CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500A) is 15cm.\nThe original observation data of vorticity correlativity is 10Hz, and the released data is the data of 30 minutes processed by Eddypro software. The main steps of its processing include: outfield value elimination, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output by Eddypro software was also screened.(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation were excluded;(3) the missing rate of 10Hz original data is more than 10% every 30min;(4) the observed data of weak turbulence at night were excluded (u* less than 0.1m/s).The average period of observation data was 30 minutes, 48 data a day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.Suspicious data caused by instrument drift shall be identified in red.The eddy current correlator will be short of electricity at night in winter, resulting in the loss of data.When the 10Hz data is missing due to a problem with the storage card (1.12-3.14,10.7-12.31), the data is replaced by the 30min flux data output from the collector.\nObservations published include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (℃), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), Mr. Hoff length L (m), sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE,Carbon dioxide flux mass identification QA_Fc.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest are 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Liu et al. (2018) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al. (2011) for observation data processing.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

In parallel, recent climate change, human activities, and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. Water resources in the alpine region are headwaters that need to be regulated to sustain downstream ecosystems. However, perturbations induced by nature/climate change and human activities in recent years have significantly reformed hydrological processes and eco-functions. Accurate estimation and prediction of hydrological processes and their key impact factors has since become crucial.",
        "Unfortunately, the scarcity of observation data in the alpine region, due to the difficulties of access and technological barriers, has hindered alpine hydrological modeling and associated research yet motivated the development of next-generation ecosystem observation networks and experiments. In comparison with the observations, using remote sensing data combined with data assimilation could improve the prediction of hydrological processes. However, due to the complexities of the earth system, there exist various sources of uncertainties in remote sensing data (especially in the alpine region), which have to be validated and calibrated. In summary, to fill the knowledge gap and promote alpine region hydrology research, an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation dataset is essential and expected to provide accurate forcing data for hydrological modeling, validate remote sensing data, allow the evaluation of distributed models and ultimately improve a predictive understanding of alpine hydrological processes and ecosystem functions. In alpine hydrology, in addition to consistent hydrometeorological data obtained from distributed meteorological stations, snow cover and frozen ground are two important indexes and driving forces that manipulate hydrological processes. The maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) before ablation determines the storage of snowmelt – a major source of freshwater in the alpine region, while freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) and soil moisture within the active layer alter water infiltration and, consequently, surface runoff and groundwater. To promote alpine hydrology research, the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (INARCH) was launched in 2015 by the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), involving 18 catchments around the world. The INARCH has since connected individual observatories into an international network and data-share platform to lead frontier research on alpine region hydrometeorology and snow observation. Another community-based observation network, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, was initiated in the early 1990s to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China and is known for its heterogeneous landscapes, diverse ecosystems, unique geographical characteristics and climate change over recent decades. As a major component of the ecohydrological processes in the arid/semi-arid HRB, the alpine hydrological processes, especially those related to snow cover and frozen ground in the upper reaches, have great impacts on runoff in the mountainous region, which then regulate agricultural development in the middle reaches and the ecosystems of the lower reaches.",
        "In recent years, with climate warming, permafrost degradation has significantly affected runoff and the carbon cycle (Peng et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018). Snow cover is widely distributed with unique characteristics in the study area. In the high-altitude mountainous region (elevation > 3800 m), influenced by the local microclimate and low temperature, snowfall could occur in any season. Temporary snow is the major snow cover type in the region at middle and low elevations because strong solar radiation and high air temperature lead to fast melting and sublimation of the snow. Drifting snow is also commonly observed in the region, which may lead to the redistribution of snowpack in high elevation regions (Essery et al., 1999; Li et al., 2014).",

At the sub-basin scale, small-scale observations and measurements focus on data such as precipitation, soil temperature and moisture, which are used to develop and improve hydrologic models, as well as to validate remote sensing products at medium to coarse resolutions (Jin et al., 2014). At the two superstations for snow cover and frozen ground observations, remote sensing products can be further validated using fine-resolution data. In total, seven AMSs, as well as the frozen ground and snow superstations (also incorporating meteorological observations), were established in the study area during the intensive observation period (IOP: 2013 -2014) to obtain the spatially distributed meteorological variables. After the IOP, four typical AMSs were selected and retained for continuous observation, which is expected to provide long-term datasets.

At the A’rou frozen ground superstation, soil temperature and moisture profiles were intensively measured in eighteen layers to a depth of 3.2 m (in a nested pattern with more layers in the topsoil) to obtain the soil hydrothermal features under freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs).

In addition, to capture snow accumulation and ablation processes, snow cover properties were collected from a snow observation superstation using state-of-the-art techniques and instruments. High-resolution soil physics datasets were also obtained to capture the freeze-thaw processes from a frozen ground observation superstation. The updated datasets were released to scientists with multidisciplinary backgrounds (i.e., cryosphere science, hydrology, and meteorology), and they are expected to serve as a testing platform to provide accurate forcing data and validate and evaluate remote sensing products and hydrological models for a broader community.",
        "This paper introduces the infrastructure of the integrated alpine hydrology observation network in the HRB and the complete datasets collected in recent years. Composed of seven standard hydrometeorological stations, one snow superstation and one frozen ground superstation, the observation network serves as an integrated research platform aiming to provide prominent datasets (e.g., hydrometeorology, snow, and frozen ground) of the hydrometeorological processes in the upper reaches of the HRB, which is expected to support alpine region hydrological model development and simulations along with remote sensing observation.",
        "A comprehensive snow dataset from the Yakou snow superstation has been updated since the summer of 2013. The observed snow variables included snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE) and blowing (drifting) snow. Data obtained from 2014/1/1 to 2017/12/31 are summarized in Figure 4, with additional plots for precipitation, ET, soil temperature and moisture. The datasets are available from 2012/12/05 to 2017/12/31, with intermittent loss mostly due to power loss and sensor malfunctions at high altitudes.",

        "不幸的是，由于高山地区观测数据的稀缺，主要是由于获取困难和技术障碍，阻碍了高山水文模型及相关研究的发展，但也促使了下一代生态系统观测网络和实验的开发。与观测数据相比，结合数据同化的遥感数据可以改善水文过程的预测。然而，由于地球系统的复杂性，遥感数据（尤其是在高山地区）存在各种不确定性来源，这些不确定性需要进行验证和校准。总之，为了填补知识空白并促进高山地区水文学研究，集成的、分布式的和多尺度的观测数据集是必不可少的，预计将为水文建模提供准确的强迫数据，验证遥感数据，评估分布式模型，并最终改善对高山水文过程和生态系统功能的预测理解。在高山水文学中，除了从分布式气象站获得的一致的水文气象数据外，雪盖和冻土是两个重要的指标和驱动因素，影响水文过程。融化前的最大雪水当量（SWE）决定了雪融水的储存——这是高山地区淡水的主要来源，而冻融循环（FTC）和活跃层内的土壤水分则改变了水的渗透，进而影响地表径流和地下水。为了促进高山水文学研究，国际高山研究流域水文学网络（INARCH）于2015年由世界气候研究计划（WCRP）的全球能量与水交换（GEWEX）项目发起，涉及全球18个流域。自那时以来，INARCH将各个观测站连接成一个国际网络和数据共享平台，以引领高山地区水文气象和雪观测的前沿研究。另一个基于社区的观测网络，极圈活跃层监测（CALM）网络，始于1990年代初，旨在观察活跃层和近地表永久冻土对气候变化的响应。黑河流域（HRB）是中国第二大内陆河流域，以其异质的景观、多样的生态系统、独特的地理特征和近年来的气候变化而闻名。作为干旱/半干旱HRB生态水文过程的主要组成部分，高山水文过程，特别是与上游雪盖和冻土相关的过程，对山区的径流产生了重大影响，从而调节中游的农业发展和下游的生态系统。",
