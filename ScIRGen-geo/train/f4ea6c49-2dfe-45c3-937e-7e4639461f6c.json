            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on Jun. 29, 2008. WiDAS, composed of four CCD cameras, one mid-infrared thermal imager (AGEMA 550), and one infrared thermal imager (S60), can acquire CCD, MIR and TIR band data. The simultaneous ground data were mainly the land surface temperature measured by the hand-held infrared thermometer in the reed plot A, the saline plots B and C and the barley plot E, the maximum of which were 120m×120m and the minimum were 30m×30m. Data were archived in Excel file. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",

These are measured in both 120m×120m and 30m×30m plots, offering high-resolution temperature data along specified transects. In contrast, the airborne WiDAS system collects data from a broader aerial perspective, capturing multi-angle visible/near-infrared, mid-infrared, and thermal infrared data over the observation area, which covers a wider scope but may offer less detail at specific points compared to ground-based methods.",
