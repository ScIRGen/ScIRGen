            "description": "The data is based on the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.1 (HWSD) constructed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Vienna International Institute for Applied Systems (IIASA). The data source of China is 1: 1 million soil data in the second national land survey provided by the Nanjing Soil Research Institute. The data can provide model input parameters for modelers, in agricultural perspective, it can be used to study eco-agricultural zoning, food security and climate change. The data format is grid and the projection is WGS84. The soil classification system used is mainly FAO-90. \nThe main fields of the soil property table include:\nSU_SYM90 (the soil name in the FAO90 soil classification system);\nSU_SYM85 (FAO85 classification);\nT_TEXTURE (top soil texture);\nDRAINAGE (19.5);\nREF_DEPTH (soil reference depth);\nAWC_CLASS (19.5);\nAWC_CLASS (soil effective water content);\nPHASE1: Real (soil phase);\nPHASE2: String (soil phase);\nROOTS: String (depth classification with obstacles to the bottom of the soil);\nSWR: String (soil moisture characteristics);\nADD_PROP: Real (a specific soil type related to agricultural use in the soil unit);\nT_GRAVEL: Real (gravel volume percentage);\nT_SAND: Real (sand content);\nT_SILT: Real (silt content);\nT_CLAY: Real (clay content);\nT_USDA_TEX: Real (USDA soil texture classification);\nT_REF_BULK: Real (soil bulk density);\nT_OC: Real (organic carbon content);\nT_PH_H2O: Real (pH)\nT_CEC_CLAY: Real (cation exchange capacity of clay soil);\nT_CEC_SOIL: Real (cation exchange capacity of soil)\nT_BS: Real (basic saturation);\nT_TEB: Real (exchangeable base);\nT_CACO3: Real (carbonate or lime content)\nT_CASO4: Real (sulfate content);\nT_ESP: Real (exchangeable sodium salt);\nT_ECE: Real (conductivity).\nThe attribute field beginning with T_ indicates the upper soil attribute (0-30cm), and the attribute field beginning with S_ indicates the lower soil attribute (30-100cm).\nFor the meaning of specific attribute values, please refer to the documentation * .pdf and database * .mdb in the folder.",

By offering detailed soil classification and attributes such as texture, organic carbon content, and cation exchange capacity, it allows researchers to accurately model and predict how soil characteristics affect agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability under changing climatic conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of soil data from different sources into a harmonized database involves several steps. First, data from the FAO and IIASA are combined with national data sources like the second national land survey for China, which provides soil data at a 1:1,000,000 scale. To resolve discrepancies in classification systems, the FAO-90 soil classification system is primarily used for standardization. The data is converted into a grid raster format with WGS84 projection, ensuring compatibility across different data sources. Attributes are standardized, where top-layer soil properties are prefixed with 'T_' and sub-layer properties with 'S_', allowing for clear differentiation and uniformity across the dataset. This process ensures that the data is consistent and can be effectively used for modeling agricultural zones, food security studies, and climate change research.",

                    "Answer": "The use of advanced geospatial technologies and remote sensing tools, such as satellite imagery and geographic information systems (GIS), have facilitated the detailed collection and integration of soil attributes in large-scale datasets. These technologies, combined with systematic soil surveys and standardized classification systems like FAO-90, allow for comprehensive data collection over extensive geographic areas, enabling detailed analysis of soil properties such as organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity.",
