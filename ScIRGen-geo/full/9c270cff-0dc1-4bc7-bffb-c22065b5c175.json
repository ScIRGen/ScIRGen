            "description": "This data set contains the observation data of large aperture scintillator on January 7, 2017 at solstice on December 31, 2017. Two large aperture scintillator models BLS450 and zzlas were installed respectively.The site is located in huailai county, hebei province, east garden town, the underlying surface for corn.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7880E, 40.3491N, and the altitude is 480m.The effective height of the large aperture scintillation instrument is 14m, the optical diameter length is 1870m, the longitude and latitude of the transmitting end is 115.8023e, 40.3596n, and the longitude and latitude of the receiving end is 115.7825e, 40.3522n.The acquisition frequencies of BLS450 and zzlas were 5Hz and 1Hz respectively, with an average output of 1min.\n\nThe original data of the large aperture scintillator is 1min, and the released data is the average data of 30min after processing and quality control. Among them, the sensible heat flux is mainly obtained by combining with the data of the automatic meteorological station and by iterative calculation based on the moning-obkhoff similarity theory.In the iterative calculation process, for BLS450, the stability function of Thiermann and Grassl, 1992 was selected.For zzlas, I'm going to pick Andreas 1988's stability function.The main quality control steps include :(1) eliminating the data of Cn2 reaching saturation;(2) eliminate data with weak demodulation signal strength;(3) data of the time of precipitation and the hour before and after the precipitation are excluded;(4) data of weak turbulence under stable conditions were excluded (u* < 0.1m/s).\n\nSeveral notes on the released data :(1) LAS data is mainly BLS450, the missing time is supplemented by zzlas observation, and the missing time of both is marked by -6999.(2) data table: Date/Time: Date/Time, Cn2: air refractive index structure parameter (m-2/3), H_LAS: sensible heat flux (W/m2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\n\nGuo et al, 2020 is used for site introduction and Liu et al, 2013 for data processing",

Originally, z0m is defined as the height where the wind speed, given by the extrapolation of the logarithmic wind profile, becomes zero. According to numerous observations, the variation range of z0m over different surfaces is large, from an order of 1.0 m over urban areas and mountainous areas, to an order of 0.1 mm or even 0.01 mm over smooth water body surfaces, ice and snow surfaces. The traditional way to calculate z0m is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. In practical applications, especially for remote sensing models and land surface models, it is difficult to obtain z0m for a local or regional scale based only on station observations. Former researchers have proposed some parameterizations between the aerodynamic roughness length and the land surface properties [e.g., vegetation height, leaf area index (LAI), etc.], since wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements (plants and other obstacles) on the land surface, and z0m describes the roughness characteristics of a surface."

Currently, there are many traditional methods for observing surface fluxes, such as the Eddy-Covariance system (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance system, and aerodynamic methods. Among these, the Eddy-Covariance system is internationally recognized as the most reliable method for observing surface fluxes; however, its observation scale is relatively small, with spatial representativeness only in the range of tens to hundreds of meters. The Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), compared to traditional Eddy-Covariance systems, can obtain average sensible heat fluxes at a regional scale (from hundreds of meters to several kilometers). Since the observation scale of LAS matches well with satellite pixel scales and the grid scales of numerical weather prediction and climate models, the observations from LAS can serve as ground truth for the pixel/grid scale of remote sensing estimation models, numerical weather prediction models, and climate models, thereby optimizing and validating these models. The observation principle of LAS is based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which, combined with the observed atmospheric refractive index structure parameter C2n and related meteorological data, utilizes the stability universal function fT related to the temperature structure parameter C2T to obtain the regional average sensible heat flux at the surface."

                    "Answer": "The large aperture scintillometer (LAS) can provide regional scale measurements of sensible heat flux because it operates over a larger spatial scale (from hundreds of meters to a few kilometers) compared to traditional methods. It uses the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory to relate the atmospheric refractive index structure parameter to sensible heat flux, which can match the scale of satellite pixels and weather model grids, providing a ground truth for model validation and optimization.",

                    "Answer": "Different stability functions are used for processing data from various types of large aperture scintillometers because they are based on the characteristics of the specific instruments and the atmospheric conditions they measure. For instance, the stability function by Thiermann and Grassl (1992) is used for the BLS450 model, while Andreas (1988) is applied for the zzlas model. These functions help in accurately calculating sensible heat flux by accommodating the specific response of each scintillometer to atmospheric stability.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges with using LAS include the difficulty in achieving the ideal homogeneous assumption due to variations in surface cover types, flatness, and weather conditions. Additionally, the form of the universal stability function fT is not universally agreed upon, and the iteration process of HLAS calculations may not converge under low wind speed and very stable conditions at night. These factors can significantly affect the applicability of Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory and the accuracy of sensible heat flux measurements.",

                    "Answer": "In the processing of LAS data, quality control steps include removing data where the structure parameter of the refractive index (Cn2) reaches saturation, excluding data with weak demodulation signal intensity, and discarding data during precipitation and one hour before and after. Further, weak turbulence data under stable conditions (u* < 0.1 m/s) are also removed. The dataset provides 30-minute average data after processing from the original 1-minute data, with missing data marked as -6999.",

                    "Answer": "The estimation of z0m is traditionally based on Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, using wind profile measurements. However, for practical applications, especially in remote sensing and land surface models, parameterizations relate z0m to land surface properties, such as vegetation height and leaf area index, because wind turbulence is controlled by the structure and spacing of roughness elements on the surface. The directional characteristics of z0m are influenced by the heterogeneity of roughness elements, and the estimation process involves aggregating individual z0m over each surface component using a footprint weighting method.",
