                "Permafrost, defined as ground that remains at or below 0 °C for at least 2 consecutive years (Dobinski, 2011), underlies more than 20 % of the exposed land area in the Northern Hemisphere (Obu et al., 2019) and constitutes an essential component of the Earth system. The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), also known as the Earth’s third pole, contains the largest mid- to low-latitude permafrost area in the world. Due to the complex topography and unique plateau climate, permafrost over the QTP is generally of low thermal stability and strongly influenced by complex local factors, such as terrain, vegetation cover, soil properties, and hydrological conditions, which differentiate it from high-latitude permafrost around the Arctic and make it more sensitive to global climate change (Li et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). In the context of global warming, significant permafrost degradation is occurring on the QTP and has strongly affected hydrological processes (Li et al., 2020), carbon cycling (Mu et al., 2020), and heat exchange processes (Zhao et al., 2020). In addition, hazards related to permafrost degradation threaten construction and infrastructure on the QTP (Wang et al., 2020). Many researchers have studied the complex responses and feedback of permafrost to climate change (Yang et al., 2019), while land surface model-based spatial modeling of permafrost has become an important approach (Ji et al., 2022). Using land surface models, many spatial modeling studies have attempted to project future changes in permafrost (Chang et al., 2018; Debolskiy et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021), assess the permafrost status under climate change (Koven et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2020), diagnose the contributors to regional permafrost degradation (Zhang et al., 2021a, b; Mekonnen et al., 2021), and project potential feedbacks on the climate system due to permafrost degradation (Zhang et al., 2020; Andresen et al., 2020; Yokohata et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). However, evaluating the spatial simulations for the QTP can be challenging due to the limited availability of ground observations, which may not be sufficient to serve as references across the vast spatial modeling domain."

Our objective is to provide a new reference map for 2010 for permafrost studies on the QTP and to provide a benchmark map for transient simulations of QTP permafrost under climate change."

                "Uncertainties associated with mapping approaches also negatively impact the accuracy of existing permafrost maps. Common statistical learning methods for permafrost mapping (Wang et al., 2019c; Ni et al., 2021) heavily rely on in situ observations as a training dataset. Therefore, they are often compromised when ground observations are unevenly distributed and have different observation periods, as is the case for the QTP. The lack of accurate soil properties, fine-tuned parameterization schemes, and high-resolution forcing data on the QTP severely challenged the applications of land surface models in mapping permafrost (Wu et al., 2018). These physically explicit models were often calibrated and validated at a point scale, leading to unpredictable uncertainties when extended to a large region with more variability and, thus, more complex conditions (Qin et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018)."

This approach accounted for the effects of local factors by incorporating (into the model) an empirical soil parameter whose values were optimally estimated through spatial clustering and parameter optimization constrained by survey-based subregion permafrost maps, and the approach was also improved to reduce parametric equifinality."

Validations using survey-based subregion permafrost maps (κ=0.74) and borehole records (overall accuracy=0.85 and κ=0.43) showed a higher accuracy of this map compared with two other recent maps. Inspection of regions with obvious distinctions between the maps affirms that the permafrost distribution on this map is more realistic than that on the Zou et al. (2017) map. Given the demonstrated excellent accuracy, this map can serve as a benchmark map for constraining/validating land surface simulations on the QTP and as a historical reference for projecting future permafrost changes on the QTP in the context of global warming."
