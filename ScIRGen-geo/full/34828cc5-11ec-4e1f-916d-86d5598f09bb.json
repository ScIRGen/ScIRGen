                    "Answer": "In the context of datasets related to the engineering geology of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, '工程地质岩组' refers to the engineering geological rock groups that are categorized based on the types of rocks present. These groups include hard rock, relatively hard rock, relatively weak rock, weak rock, and loose rock. This classification is crucial for understanding the main material components of the rock and soil mass, serving as a basis for engineering design, evaluating the stability of the rock and soil mass, and acting as a factor in disaster risk analysis. It helps avoid difficulties in risk assessment caused by too many rock types and can be applied to major engineering construction and disaster risk analysis on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Question": "What can be inferred about the classification of rock groups and their engineering implications from the defined categories based on uniaxial compressive strength in datasets focused on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau?",
                    "Answer": "The classification of rock groups into five categories—坚硬岩组 (hard rock group), 较坚硬岩组 (relatively hard rock group), 较软弱岩组 (relatively weak rock group), 软弱岩组 (weak rock group), and 松散岩组 (loose rock group)—based on uniaxial compressive strength provides a foundational understanding of the rock's material properties. This classification aids in engineering design by offering insights into the stability and suitability of rock formations for construction purposes. Additionally, it serves as a critical factor in disaster risk analysis by simplifying the complexity of rock types, making it easier to assess potential risks in major construction projects on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "Categorizing rock types into these specific groups based on their saturated uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) provides a structured approach to understanding the main material components of rock and soil bodies. It aids in engineering design by offering a clear basis for evaluating the engineering stability of rock and soil bodies. Additionally, it serves as a factor in disaster risk analysis, potentially simplifying the risk assessment process by reducing the complexity associated with numerous rock types, thereby facilitating more effective planning and prevention strategies for major engineering projects and disaster risk assessments on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",
