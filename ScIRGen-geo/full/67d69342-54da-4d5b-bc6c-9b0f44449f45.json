            "description": "This data set mainly includes apatite in-situ SR Nd isotope and zircon in-situ HF-O isotope data of Shuikoushan and Xihuashan granites in Nanling area, wolframite trace element data and single fluid inclusion LA-ICP-MS composition analysis data of Piaotang Tungsten Deposit, wolframite stable O isotope data and single fluid inclusion LA-ICP-MS composition analysis data of Xihuashan Tungsten Deposit. Based on the relevant data, combined with in-situ analysis of fluid inclusions and fine mineralogy, the precipitation process and mechanism of wolframite in South China are revealed. It is found that the wolframite hosted in the rock mass is caused by water rock interaction, while the wolframite hosted outside the rock mass is formed by boiling cooling of magmatic fluid, It is not that the two types of wolframite have the same precipitation process in the past, which provides a new understanding for the in-depth understanding of vein type wolframite deposits, enriches and develops the theoretical system of tungsten mineralization, and broadens the prospecting ideas.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of geochemical data collection for granite and mineral deposits, 'in-situ isotopic analysis' refers to the technique of measuring isotopic compositions directly within the mineral grains (such as apatite, zircon, or quartz) without extracting them from the rock matrix. This method can involve tools like LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) to obtain Sr-Nd, Hf-O isotope data from specific mineral sites, providing precise information about the geological history and processes involved in the formation of granite and associated mineral deposits.",

These variations suggest that wolframite within granitic bodies is formed through water-rock interactions, while those outside are a result of magmatic fluid boiling and cooling. This challenges previous assumptions about uniform precipitation processes and provides new insights into the formation of vein-type wolframite deposits, thereby enhancing the understanding of tungsten metallogenic theories and exploration strategies.",

This understanding challenges previous assumptions that both types of wolframite shared identical precipitation processes, thereby enriching the metallogenic theoretical system and expanding exploration strategies.",

The data collection methods utilize precise isotopic measurement techniques, likely involving mass spectrometry. Additionally, analysis of fluid inclusions is conducted using LA-ICP-MS for elemental composition, which aids in understanding the deposition processes and mechanisms of tungsten mineralization.",
