            "description": "Lake distribution on the Tibetan Plateau is extensive, and lake area changes are key indicators of the TP's climate change response. This study proposes an improved lake area extraction method based on isobath interpolation, overcoming the impact of cloud cover on Landsat optical remote sensing images with long time series. The method was applied to approximately 92,000 Landsat 5/7/8 images, extracting annual average area sequence data for 180 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau from 1986 to 2020. The accuracy of lake area results was validated with existing lake area datasets (manually inspected and edited) and water level dataset, both yielding a correlation coefficient of about 0.9. This study obtained the interannual area change patterns of lakes classified based on different sizes, regions, and types (glacier-fed/non-glacier-fed, endorheic/exorheic). In conjunction with climate variables, a preliminary qualitative analysis was conducted, providing reference data for studying the response of lakes to climate change.",
