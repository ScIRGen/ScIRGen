      "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Dashalong station from January 1 to December 31, 2019. The site (98.941° E, 38.840° N) was located on a swamp meadow surface in the Longshatan, which is near west of Qilian county, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3739 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45C; 5 m, north), wind speed and direction profile (010C/020C; 10 m, north), air pressure (PTB110; in the tamper box on the ground), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), four-component radiometer (CNR1; 6 m, south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (109ss-L; 0, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), and soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m; RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2019-9-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) and Che et al.

        "Operational application of a remote sensing-based two source energy balance model (TSEB) to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and the components evaporation (E), transpiration (T) at a range of space and time scales is very useful for managing water resources in arid and semiarid watersheds. The TSEB model uses composite land surface temperature as input and applies a simplified Priestley–Taylor formulation to partition this temperature into soil and vegetation component temperatures and then computes subsequent component energy fluxes. Accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) have a wide range of applications in hydrology, climate, weather and crop yield forecasting, drought monitoring, and water resource management. Ground-based measurements from lysimeters or from eddy covariance flux tower observations can provide representative values of ET at field scale and with high frequency eddy covariance data it’s partitioning into E and T under certain environmental conditions. To address the need for large scale spatially distributed ET, several remote sensing based approaches using the satellite-based thermal infrared (TIR) and visible and near infrared (VNIR) imagery have been developed and refined in recent years. Compared with the OSM-contextual based approaches, the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) is more physical-based since the parameterizations explicitly treat the radiative temperature and energy exchanges between soil and vegetation, and soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface. There have been great advances in the application of thermal infrared remote sensing for using the TSEB model to estimate land surface ET and its component of E and T."

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric.

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

In parallel, recent climate change, human activities, and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. Water resources in the alpine region are headwaters that need to be regulated to sustain downstream ecosystems. However, perturbations induced by nature/climate change and human activities in recent years have significantly reformed hydrological processes and eco-functions. Accurate estimation and prediction of hydrological processes and their key impact factors has since become crucial.",
        "Unfortunately, the scarcity of observation data in the alpine region, due to the difficulties of access and technological barriers, has hindered alpine hydrological modeling and associated research yet motivated the development of next-generation ecosystem observation networks and experiments. In comparison with the observations, using remote sensing data combined with data assimilation could improve the prediction of hydrological processes. However, due to the complexities of the earth system, there exist various sources of uncertainties in remote sensing data (especially in the alpine region), which have to be validated and calibrated. In summary, to fill the knowledge gap and promote alpine region hydrology research, an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation dataset is essential and expected to provide accurate forcing data for hydrological modeling, validate remote sensing data, allow the evaluation of distributed models and ultimately improve a predictive understanding of alpine hydrological processes and ecosystem functions. In alpine hydrology, in addition to consistent hydrometeorological data obtained from distributed meteorological stations, snow cover and frozen ground are two important indexes and driving forces that manipulate hydrological processes. The maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) before ablation determines the storage of snowmelt – a major source of freshwater in the alpine region, while freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) and soil moisture within the active layer alter water infiltration and, consequently, surface runoff and groundwater. To promote alpine hydrology research, the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (INARCH) was launched in 2015 by the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), involving 18 catchments around the world. The INARCH has since connected individual observatories into an international network and data-share platform to lead frontier research on alpine region hydrometeorology and snow observation. Another community-based observation network, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, was initiated in the early 1990s to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China and is known for its heterogeneous landscapes, diverse ecosystems, unique geographical characteristics and climate change over recent decades. As a major component of the ecohydrological processes in the arid/semi-arid HRB, the alpine hydrological processes, especially those related to snow cover and frozen ground in the upper reaches, have great impacts on runoff in the mountainous region, which then regulate agricultural development in the middle reaches and the ecosystems of the lower reaches.",
        "In recent years, with climate warming, permafrost degradation has significantly affected runoff and the carbon cycle (Peng et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018). Snow cover is widely distributed with unique characteristics in the study area. In the high-altitude mountainous region (elevation > 3800 m), influenced by the local microclimate and low temperature, snowfall could occur in any season. Temporary snow is the major snow cover type in the region at middle and low elevations because strong solar radiation and high air temperature lead to fast melting and sublimation of the snow. Drifting snow is also commonly observed in the region, which may lead to the redistribution of snowpack in high elevation regions (Essery et al., 1999; Li et al., 2014).",

At the sub-basin scale, small-scale observations and measurements focus on data such as precipitation, soil temperature and moisture, which are used to develop and improve hydrologic models, as well as to validate remote sensing products at medium to coarse resolutions (Jin et al., 2014). At the two superstations for snow cover and frozen ground observations, remote sensing products can be further validated using fine-resolution data. In total, seven AMSs, as well as the frozen ground and snow superstations (also incorporating meteorological observations), were established in the study area during the intensive observation period (IOP: 2013 -2014) to obtain the spatially distributed meteorological variables. After the IOP, four typical AMSs were selected and retained for continuous observation, which is expected to provide long-term datasets.

        "Accurate monitoring of surface fluxes over land surfaces is necessary for global climate change research, ecological environment management, and agricultural and water resource planning. The magnitude of the surface flux is largely determined by vegetation parameters, soil moisture and other states of the land surface. The major methods used for estimating surface fluxes are field measurement, remote-sensing-based methods, and land surface modeling. The variability in field measurements of surface flux has been documented over diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales.",
        "Land surface models have been rapidly developed to predict surface fluxes on continuous spatial and temporal scales with physical constraints. Regardless of their specific model structures, all land surface models require observational data to calibrate their parameters and adjust their states. New techniques such as data assimilation are needed to integrate either field or remotely sensed observations with the models, thus improving model accuracy by correcting the model state variables and parameters. Data assimilation has played an increasingly important role in improving predictions of such land surface state variables as the leaf area index, soil temperature profile, soil moisture profile, and other related variables, e.g., surface fluxes.",
        "Spatially distributed estimates of surface flux can be obtained from remote-sensing-based methods. The surface fluxes also can be obtained based on variational techniques and relatively simple models with the assimilation of field-measured land surface temperatures. In a land surface model, the sensible and latent heat fluxes are diagnostic variables, and they are affected by many factors (e.g., model states and parameters). As a new-generation Chinese polar orbiting meteorological satellite, the FY-3 series consists of two experimental (FY-3A/B) and at least four operational satellites (FY-3C/D/E/F). The FY-3 series is expected to have a service life that lasts until 2020. The FY-3A was launched in the year 2008. Visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR) is one of the 11 sensors mounted on the FY-3A satellite and has a nominal spatial resolution of approximately 1 km×1 km at the nadir. The common land model (CoLM) is a state-of-the-art model developed by many groups and validated with extensive field data sites. In CoLM, soil moisture is important for dividing the net radiation into the ground heat, sensible, and latent heat fluxes.",
        "Inaccurate surface flux predictions are highly correlated with errors in land surface temperature estimates. Generally, the diurnal variation trends of the land surface temperature and surface flux can be predicted correctly using the CoLM. The daily averaged evaporation fraction (EF, ratio between latent heat flux and available energy) can be used to describe the splitting of available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes. The LAS instrument can measure the sensible heat flux at a larger scale than the EC system."

The deviations between the FY3A-VIRR LST data and the ground measurements are determined by many factors. The terrain effect can affect the accuracy of the FY3A-VIRR LST retrievals. The mismatch of the spatial and temporal scales between the FY3A-VIRR and field-measured LST can also cause these biases.",
        "The differences between the sensible heat fluxes measured by the EC and LAS system are primarily caused by the energy imbalance of the EC, the heterogeneity of the underlying surfaces, and the differences between the source areas of the EC and LAS measurements. Because of the short memory of the land surface temperature, it is difficult to assimilate the land surface temperatures. Directly assimilating land surface temperature to optimize soil moisture may cause model simulations that are more unstable."

In a heterogeneous and non-isothermal pixel, however, the radiance observed by the remote sensor at the top of atmosphere (TOA) is the ensemble radiance of several components (i.e., sunlit and shaded soil and vegetation) so the pixel-average temperature cannot reveal the real temperature of each component, particularly in the sparse vegetation-covered arid and semi-arid areas where the soil and vegetation component temperatures are usually significantly different. Additionally, the component temperatures of a mixed pixel encapsulate more physical information than the composite temperature that relate to soil and vegetation heat fluxes and hydrologic states. By deriving component soil and vegetation temperatures, the accuracy of surface fluxes estimated by two-source (soil + vegetation) energy balance models should improve capabilities to monitor crop water stress and drought, estimate surface soil moisture and result in more accurate weather forecasts."

        "Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important components of surface energy budgets and hydrologic cycles. Flux observation networks (e.g., FluxNet) and enhanced experiments (e.g., HiWATER) have been set up to monitor long-term surface heat fluxes over different kinds of land cover. However, in situ measurements are expensive and difficult to extend to continental scales. Thus, models have been developed to map ET over continental scales based on remotely sensed information. Unfortunately, thermal remotely sensed models can only detect a snapshot of ET spatial distributions at the time of satellite overpass. The snapshot of the ET map cannot satisfy practical applications, such as, irrigation judgment, and water resource planning and management. To satisfy such applications, the instantaneous ET needs to be upscaled to daily values for clear-sky days. Moreover, continuous daily ET values should be generated with temporal reconstruction approaches to fulfill long-term hydrologic requirements. The upscaling methods can only be used to estimate daily ET with the instantaneous ET values over clear-sky days. This can be an issue, because it is difficult to obtain cloud-free thermal remote sensing data for every day of the year. It is, therefore, necessary to develop algorithms to reconstruct continuous daily ET variations with discrete clear-sky daily ET estimates."

To reconstruct clear-sky daily ET to continuous daily, data assimilation methods based on the Penman-Monteith equation were developed with two data assimilation techniques (EnKF and SCE_UA). The developed data assimilation methods were also compared with three commonly used temporal reconstruction approaches (surface resistance method, reference evapotranspiration approach, and HANTS package). Finally, the annual remotely sensed ET over Beijing area was estimated with these methods and compared with the water balance ET data."

        "No soil moisture or precipitation data were used in any of the temporal reconstruction approaches. However, soil moisture may increase suddenly due to precipitation and thermal remote sensing is not able to detect this change during rainy days. Thus, errors may be cut down by developing ET temporal reconstruction methods that can assimilate microwave soil moisture (e.g., SMAP), or precipitation observations. Without an input for forcing data (e.g., solar radiation, precipitation), the ET_HANTS method cannot detect a sudden decrease in ET caused by clouds. Thus, the estimated cloudy-sky ET from ET_HANTS is usually larger than in situ measurements."

      "methods": [
        "In this study, a remotely sensed ET model was used to estimate the instantaneous ET during satellite overpass time. Using this model, the instantaneous net radiation (Rn), ground heat flux (G) and sensible heat flux (H) can be calculated with atmospheric interpolated forcing data (wind speed, air temperature/humidity, etc.) and remote sensing data (land surface temperature, albedo, emissivity, NDVI, etc.). With Rn, G, and H, the latent heat flux (LE) can be obtained with the residual method via LE = Rn − G − H. Five methods were selected to upscale instantaneous ET to daily values and are summarized below. The ConEF method treats the evaporative fraction (EF, EF = LE/Rn − G) as a constant during the daytime and that daily ET can be calculated using daily available energy. The ConEF method usually leads to a 5% –10% underestimation of daily ET using EF around noon instead of daily EF. This method adds 10% of EF to correct the error caused by ConEF. The DiEF method introduced three parameters to correct ConEF method, including (1) the difference between instantaneous and daytime EF, βEF; (2) the difference between daytime-averaged and daily-averaged available energy, βA; (3) the difference between daytime and daily ET, βLE. The SolRad method assumes the ratio of latent heat flux and solar radiation is constant at the daily time scale. The ConETrF method assumes the ratio of ET and ETr is constant on the daily time scale. In the developed data assimilation scheme, the Penman-Monteith equation was used as the model operator and the clear-sky daily ET estimates were assimilated into the Penman-Monteith equation to generate the continuous daily ET. The surface resistance method was built, based on the Penman-Monteith equation, to reconstruct ET estimates over cloudy conditions. The ratio of ET and ETr on cloudy-sky days can be interpolated by ETrF on neighboring clear-sky days. The HANTS method is a time series analysis method based on Fourier transforms."
