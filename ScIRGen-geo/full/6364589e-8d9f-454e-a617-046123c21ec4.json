            "description": "In this paper, we review evidence for a major biotic turnover across the Oligocene/Miocene in the Tibetan\nPlateau region. Based on the recent study of six well-preserved fossil sites from the Cenozoic Lunpola and Nima\nbasins in the central Tibetan Plateau, we report a regional changeover from tropical/subtropical ecosystems in\nthe Late Oligocene ecosystem (26–24 Ma) to a cooler, alpine biota of the Early Miocene (23–18 Ma). The Late\nOligocene fossil biota, comprising of fish (climbing perch), insects and plants (palms), shows that the hinterland\nof the Tibetan Plateau was a warm lowland influenced by tropical humidity from the Indian Ocean. In the Early\nMiocene, the regional biota became transformed, with the evolution and diversification of the endemic primitive snow carp. Early Miocene vegetation was dominated by temperate broad-leaved forest with abundant conifers and herbs under a cool climate, and mammals included the hornless rhinoceros, Plesiaceratherium, a warm temperate taxon. This dramatic ecosystem change is due to a cooling linked to the uplift of Tibetan region, from a Late Oligocene paleo-elevation of no greater than 2300 m a.s.l. in the sedimentary basin to a paleo-elevation of about 3000 m a.s.l. Another factor was the Cenozoic global climatic deterioration toward to an ice-house world.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau is the highest and largest plateau on Earth, with an average elevation over 4000 m above sea level (a.s.l.), and supports a typical alpine ecosystem. The Cenozoic uplift of the Tibetan region was one of the most important orogenic events of the last 500 Myrs, which not only greatly changed topography and climate in Asia and more widely, but also strongly influenced the evolution of the biosphere. Since the breakup of Gondwana in the Cretaceous, the Indian Plate drifted northwards at a rapid rate. The Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian continent in the early Cenozoic, and the Tibetan Plateau began to take form gradually. Previously, macrofossils were collected mainly from the middle-late Neogene deposits surrounding the plateau, and the Paleogene data were rare in the central plateau. Recent research on the Cenozoic paleontology and stratigraphy of the Tibetan Plateau demonstrates an outstanding richness of sedimentary and fossil records in Tibet, which testifies to Cenozoic changes in the region, and elucidates many significant changes in the landscape and the ecosystem during the uplift of the Tibetan region."

This might include datasets on global climatic changes, tectonic movements, or biotic shifts from other plateaus.",
