            "description": "In order to comprehensively understand the current status of wild vascular plant resources in Qinghai and provide background information for the protection of plant diversity in Qinghai, based on existing historical data, we comprehensively collected relevant literature on plant research in Qinghai, combined with years of field survey data and specimen information, and compiled and updated the list of wild vascular plants in Qinghai. 85.01% of species and sub species types are accompanied by voucher specimens (including collector, specimen collection number and barcode number), origin, habitat, distribution and other information. There are a total of 2916 species (including subspecies and varieties) of wild vascular plants belonging to 602 genera in 109 families distributed in Qinghai, including 55 species of 20 genera in 12 families of lycophytes and ferns; 36 species of gymnosperms belonging to 6 genera and 3 families; There are 2825 species of angiosperms belonging to 576 genera in 94 families, an increase of 500 species compared to the \"Qinghai Plant List\". The statistical results show that the top 10 dominant families in the number of wild vascular plants in Qinghai Province are Asteraceae (346 species), Poaceae (343 species), Leguminosae (222 species), Ranunculaceae (160 species), Rosaceae (146 species), Brassicaceae (113 species), Leuciscinae (96 species), Gentianaceae (90 species), Cyperaceae (86 species), and Caryophyllaceae (84 species), with a total of 1686 species, accounting for 57.82% of the total number of wild vascular plants in Qinghai Province; The top 5 dominant genera are Astragalus (95 species), Pedicularis (83 species), Saussurea (76 species), Artemisia (66 species), and Carex (65 species); The composition of families is mainly composed of less than 20 species, while the composition of genera is mainly composed of less than 5 species. At the same time, this directory includes a total of 47 species of nationally protected wild plants (all of which are second-class), belonging to 17 families and 25 genera. This directory will provide reliable theoretical basis for the investigation of plant background resources, field monitoring, collection and preservation of germplasm resources, and biodiversity conservation in Qinghai.",

Verification can be enhanced by cross-referencing historical literature, conducting multiple field investigations, and utilizing specimen data to update and maintain accurate species lists. The integration of habitat and distribution information is also crucial to ensure comprehensive documentation.",
