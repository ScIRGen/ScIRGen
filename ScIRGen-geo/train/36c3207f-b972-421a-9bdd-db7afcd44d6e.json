            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Envisat ASAR was obtained in No. 1 and 2 quadrates of the E'bao foci experimental area on Oct. 17, 2007 during the pre-observation period\n     The data were in AP mode and VV/VH polarization combinations, and the overpass time was approximately at 23:04 BJT. Both the quadrates were divided into 3×3 subsites, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. 25 sampling points were chosen, including centers and corners.\n     Simultaneous with the satellite overpass, numerous ground data were collected, soil volumetric moisture, soil conductivity, the soil temperature, and the real part of soil complex permittivity by the WET soil moisture tachometer; the surface radiative temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer; soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density by drying soil samples from the cutting ring. Meanwhile, vegetation parameters as height, coverage and water content were also observed. Meanwhile, vegetation parameters as height, coverage and water content were also observed. \n     Those provide reliable ground data for retrieval and verification of soil moisture, soil freeze/thaw status and the microwave radiative transfer model from active remote sensing approaches.",

Accurate synchronization ensures that the ground data accurately reflects the conditions during the satellite overpass, which is critical for developing reliable models and validating remote sensing techniques.",
