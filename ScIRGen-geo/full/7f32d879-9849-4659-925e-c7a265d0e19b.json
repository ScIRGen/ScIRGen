            "description": "The dataset of airborne Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometers (PLMR) was acquired on 30 June, 2012, located in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The aircraft took off at 13:10 pm (UTC+8) from Zhangye airport and landed at 18:40 pm, with the flight time of 5.5 hours. The flight was performed in the altitude of about 2500 m and at the speed of about 220-250 km during the observation, corresponding to an expected ground resolution of about 750 m.\nThe PLMR instrument flown on a small aircraft operates at 1.413 GHz (L-band), with both H- and V-polarizations at incidence angles of ±7.5°, ±21.5° and ±38.5°. PLMR ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ calibrations were performed before and after each flight. The processed PLMR data include 2 DAT files (v-pol and h-pol separately) and 1 KMZ file for each flying day. The DAT file contains all the TB values together with their corresponding beam ID, incidence angle, location, time stamp (in UTC) and other flight attitude information as per headings. The KMZ file shows the gridded 1-km TB values corrected to 38.5 degrees together with flight lines. Cautions should be taken when using these data, as the RFI contaminations are often higher than expected at v-polarization.",

It is susceptible to electromagnetic interference, especially affecting the V polarization TB values more strongly than the H polarization. The method involves flying at an altitude of around 2500m at speeds between 220-250km/hr, with 'hot' and 'cold' radiation calibration performed at the start and end of flights. These characteristics can be compared to other remote sensing techniques by evaluating the electromagnetic interference impact, calibration requirements, and the resolution of data obtained.",

The radiometer collects data on V and H polarization at a frequency of 1.4 GHz with zenith angle observations. The flight path is mapped using KMZ files to provide a 1 km grid distribution of TB values at a 38.5-degree incidence angle. During the flight, 'hot' and 'cold' radiation calibrations are performed at the beginning and end. The data collected includes TB values, scan beam ID, incidence angle, position, time stamp (UTC), and other flight attitude information. The collected data must account for electromagnetic interference, which affects V polarization TB values more than H polarization. The raw data is divided into microwave radiometer data and geographic location data for further analysis and processing.",

The technology allows for data collection at various polarizations and includes position and time-stamped metadata, facilitated by precise flight path control at a height of around 2500m and a speed of 220-250km/hr over the target area.",
