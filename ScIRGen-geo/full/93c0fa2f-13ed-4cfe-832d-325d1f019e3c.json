            "description": "Glacial lake inventory from 1977-2017, based on Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI imagery, uses a semi-automatic water body classification method to distinguish between water body and non-water body information, then extracts the lake boundaries and visually checks and manually edits them by comparison with the original Landsat images. The MSS sensor data was used in 1977 with a resolution of 60 m. Image data used after 1987 had a resolution of 30 m.The relationship between glacial meltwater and glacial lake recharge was determined from RGI 6.0 and Google Earth.",

                "The Himalaya and its adjacent Tibetan regions host a large distribution of glacial lakes. The rapid retreat and thinning of glaciers in the Himalaya, together with the changes in glacial lakes, are the expected responses to climate change. The glacial lakes in the Himalaya possess spatial and temporal heterogeneity and have experienced an overall increase in quantity, volume, and surface area expansion rate. The increase in the area of glacial lakes adds to the risk of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOFs) events. The Himalayan range in Nepal is characterized by large valley glaciers with their tongues mostly covered with moraine and debris—conditions that favor the formation of glacial lakes. The formation and development of glacial lakes have continuously accelerated since the second half of the 20th century across the 800 km long Himalayan range of Nepal. Hence, glacial lakes in the Nepal Himalaya have garnered worldwide attention, especially from the scientific community, as outburst floods from glacial lakes represent a significant hazard to the communities and infrastructure of this mountainous region. A recent study ranked Nepal among the countries with the highest damage from GLOFs and with great socioeconomic consequences. The Nepal Himalaya, located in Central Himalaya, is highly susceptible to GLOFs that originate in its own territory and transboundary region."

                    "Answer": "The use of Landsat imagery combined with the NDWI method for glacial lake boundary delineation is effective due to the availability of multi-temporal data and the semiautomated nature of NDWI, which facilitates the differentiation of water bodies from surrounding landscapes. However, the approach requires post-correction through visual checks and manual editing to address challenges like snow/ice cover and shadows, indicating that while effective, the method requires human intervention for accuracy.",

These challenges can affect data accuracy by introducing uncertainties in delineation and classification processes, necessitating careful visual inspection and editing to ensure reliability.",
