            "description": "The geochronological data set of Dahutang w-cu-mo deposit in South China includes age data of different rock minerals and ore minerals. One biotite, five muscovite and 22 molybdenite samples were selected for dating by single mineral separation. The geochronological data of rocks and ores are mainly obtained by AR Ar dating of biotite and muscovite and Re Os dating of molybdenite. According to the geochronological data obtained, two major magmatic and mineralization periods are constrained. The study shows that the Dahutang w-cu-mo deposit is the result of multi-stage mineralization of 20 million years.",

                    "Answer": "Geological geochronology in the context of studying mineral deposits refers to the determination of the age of rocks, minerals, and mineral deposits. This involves using specific dating methods such as Ar-Ar dating for minerals like biotite and muscovite, and Re-Os dating for molybdenite, to establish the timing of magmatic activities and mineralization periods, which in the case of the Dahuotong tungsten-copper-molybdenum deposit, indicates a multi-phase mineralization process over 20 million years.",

                    "Answer": "The geological age data collected using Ar-Ar dating on biotite and muscovite, along with Re-Os dating on molybdenite, suggest that the 华南地区大湖塘钨铜钼矿床 underwent multiple episodes of magmatic activity and mineralization spanning over a period of 20 million years. This indicates a complex and prolonged geological evolution characterized by multi-phase ore-forming processes.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of dating methods like Ar-Ar for micas and Re-Os for molybdenite in geological age determination is influenced by the type of minerals available (e.g., biotite, muscovite, molybdenite), the precision and reliability of these methods for the minerals in question, and the need to accurately constrain the timing of magmatic and mineralization events, which in the case of the Dahu-Tang W-Cu-Mo deposit, were part of a multiphase mineralization process spanning 20 million years.",

                    "Answer": "Using different geochronological methods, such as Ar-Ar dating for mica and Re-Os dating for molybdenite, can provide a comprehensive understanding of the chronological sequence of mineralization events. This approach allows researchers to identify and constrain the timing of major magmatic and mineralization periods, revealing that the mineralization process in the region is a result of multiple episodes occurring over a span of 20 million years.",
