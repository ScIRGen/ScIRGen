            "description": "This dataset includes the observation data from 01 Jan. 2019 through 31 Dec. 2019, collected by lysimeters, which are located at 115.788E, 40.349N and 480 m above sea level, near the Huailai Station in East Garden Town, Huailai County, Hebei Province. The land cover around the station was maize crop. \nThe weighable lysimeter was built by UMS GmbH (Germany), with a surface area of 1m2, and a soil column of 1.5 m high. The original data sampling frequency was 1 Hz, and then averaged to 10min for distribution. The precision of the weighing data is 10g (equivalent to 0.01mm). During the crop growth period, a lysimeter is covered by bare soil and another one is covered by planted maize. The soil moisture, temperature and soil water potential sensors are installed both inside and outside of the lysimeter to ensure that the water cycle in the soil column is consistent with that of the field. Different sensors are located at different depths: 5, 50, 100 cm for soil temperature sensors, and 5, 10, 30, 50, 100 cm for soil moisture sensors, and 30 and 140cm for soil water potential sensors (the tensionmeter here can also measure soil temperature at 30, 140 cm). The soil heat flux plates in both lysimeters are buried at 10cm depth.\nThe data processes and quality control according to: 1) ensuring there were 144 data every day, the lost data were replaced by -6999; 2) deleting the abnormal data; 3) deleting the outlier data; 4) keeping the consistent date and time format (e.g. 2019-01-01 10:30).\nThe distributed data include the following variables: Date-Time, Weight (I.L_1_WAG_L_000(Kg), I.L_2_WAG_L_000(Kg)), Drainage Weight (I.L_1_WAG_D_000(Kg), I.L_2_WAG_D_000(Kg)), Soil Heat Flux (Gs_1_10cm, Gs_2_10cm) (W/m2), Soil Moisture (Ms_1_5cm, Ms_1_10cm, Ms_1_30cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_100cm, Ms_2_5cm, Ms_2_10cm, Ms_2_30cm, Ms_2_50cm, Ms_2_100cm) (%), Soil Temperature (Ts_1_5cm , Ts_1_30cm, Ts_1_50cm, Ts_1_100cm, Ts_1_140cm, Ts_2_5cm , Ts_2_30cm, Ts_2_50cm, Ts_2_100cm, Ts_2_140cm) (C), Soil Water Potential (TS_1_30(hPa), TS_1_140(hPa), TS_2_30(hPa), TS_2_140(hPa)). The format of datasets was *.xls.",

                    "Answer": "A lysimeter is an instrument used to measure the amount of water that is lost from the soil, specifically through processes such as evaporation and plant transpiration, collectively known as evapotranspiration. It typically consists of a container filled with soil and planted with vegetation, which is weighed to determine changes in mass due to water loss. In the mentioned field, the lysimeter is a cylindrical structure with a surface area of 1m² and a soil column depth of 1.5m, equipped with sensors for soil temperature, moisture, and heat flux, among others, to provide precise measurements of evapotranspiration.",

                    "Answer": "Using high-frequency data collection methods, such as 1Hz sampling in lysimeters, improves the accuracy of evapotranspiration measurements by capturing rapid changes in soil and atmospheric conditions, reducing the likelihood of missing transient events and providing a detailed temporal resolution that allows for precise daily and seasonal calculations of water fluxes in agricultural settings like corn fields.",
