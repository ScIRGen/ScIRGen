            "description": "The data set contains the observation data of the evapotranspiration apparatus on January 1, 2016, solstice, December 31, 2016.The site is located in huailai county, hebei province, east garden town, the underlying surface for corn.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 115.7880E, 40.3491N, and the altitude is 480m.\nThe collection frequency of the evapotranspiration permeameter is 1 time/min, and the released data is 10min output data.The evapotranspiration meter is a cylindrical structure with a surface area of 1m2 and a buried depth of 1.5m. The observation accuracy of evapotranspiration is 0.01mm.Two evapotranspiration seeptometers were installed, one kept bare soil (lysimeter_1), the other for the corn underlay (lysimeter_2) during the growing season (May 10 - September 15).Soil temperature and humidity probe, soil water potential probe and soil heat flow plate are also installed in the evapotranspiration apparatus.The buried depth of the soil temperature sensor is 5cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm and 140cm.The buried depth of the soil water sensor is 2cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm.The soil heat flux plate is buried 10cm underground;The buried depth of the soil water potential sensor was 30cm and 140cm.Processing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) delete the data of observation anomalies caused during maintenance;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the format of date and time is unified, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2016-6-10-10:30.\nThe observation data released by the evapotranspiration permeameter include:Date/Time, weighing mass (i.l._1_wag_l_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_l_000 (Kg)), seepage mass (i.l._1_wag_d_000 (Kg), i.l._2_wag_d_000 (Kg)), soil heat flux (Gs_1_10cm, Gs_2_10cm) (W/m2),Multi-layer soil moisture (Ms_1_5cm, Ms_1_10cm, Ms_1_30cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_50cm, Ms_1_100cm, Ms_2_5cm, Ms_2_10cm, Ms_2_30cm, Ms_2_50cm, Ms_2_100cm) (%),Multi-layer soil temperature (Ts_1_5cm, Ts_1_30cm, Ts_1_50cm, Ts_1_100cm, Ts_1_140cm, Ts_2_140cm, ts_2_2_5cm, ts_2_2_50cm, Ts_2_100cm, Ts_2_140cm) (℃), soil water potential (TS_1_30 (hPa), TS_1_140 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_30 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa), TS_2_140 (hPa));The data is stored in *.xls format.",

The data may reveal how surface conditions impact deeper soil layers, the response of soil moisture to precipitation or irrigation events, and how temperature fluctuations affect the soil profile. Understanding these dynamics can inform predictions about evapotranspiration rates, root zone water availability, and the thermal regime of the soil, which are critical for agricultural management and hydrological modeling.",

                    "Answer": "To ensure the accuracy and consistency of multi-layer soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil water potential data collected from lysimeters in an agricultural setting, several procedural steps are necessary: (1) Ensure the collection of 144 data points per day at a 10-minute interval, marking any missing data with -6999. (2) Remove anomalous data caused by maintenance activities. (3) Eliminate data that are physically unreasonable or exceed instrument range. (4) Unify the format of date and time, recording them in a single column. These steps help maintain data integrity and facilitate subsequent analysis.",
