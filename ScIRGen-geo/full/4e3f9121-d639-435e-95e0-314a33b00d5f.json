            "description": "The 30 m / month synthetic photosynthetic effective radiation absorption ratio (fAPAR) data set of Heihe River basin provides the monthly Lai synthetic products from 2011 to 2014. This data uses the characteristics of HJ / CCD data of China's domestic satellite, which has both high time resolution (2 days after Networking) and spatial resolution (30 m), to construct multi angle observation data set, considering different vegetation types, based on land cover classification map, combined with 30 m /Monthly synthetic leaf area index (LAI) products were produced by fapar-p model based on energy conservation. Based on the principle of energy conservation, the algorithm considers the multiple bounces between vegetation, soil and vegetation, as well as the influence of various factors such as sky scattered light. By analyzing the process of the interaction between photons and canopy, from the point of view that the movement of photons in the canopy is equal to the probability of re collision when multiple scattering occurs, a uniform and continuous vegetation fAPAR model is established. In addition, the effects of various factors on the fAPAR model were analyzed, including soil and leaf reflectance, aggregation index, and G function. The algorithm is highly dynamic, and can get better results for different soil background, vegetation type, radiation conditions, light and observation geometry, weather conditions. Compared with the data of corn canopy par measurement in Yingke irrigation area of Zhangye City, Gansu Province on July 8, 2012, the 30 m / month fAPAR product has a high consistency with the ground observation data, and the error with the observation value is less than 5%. In a word, the 30 m / month synthetic photosynthetic effective radiation absorption ratio (fAPAR) data set of Heihe River Basin comprehensively uses the multi temporal and multi angle observation data to improve the estimation accuracy and time resolution of parameter products, and better serves the application of remote sensing data products.",

Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

This includes using different instruments and observation techniques to gather data that can vary in resolution and scope, ultimately aiming to provide comprehensive insights into the eco-hydrological dynamics of an area.",

                    "Answer": "The 'energy conservation principle' in the development of FAPAR models is significant because it serves as the foundational basis for calculating the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). This principle considers the multiple reflections and scattering of light within the vegetation canopy, ensuring that the model accurately accounts for the energy exchanges between soil, vegetation, and the atmosphere. This leads to more precise estimates of FAPAR across different environmental conditions and vegetation types.",

This involves setting up various observational systems, such as eddy covariance towers and automatic meteorological stations, at different scales and locations to capture diverse eco-hydrological processes. This method allows researchers to understand interactions across scales, from small plots to larger landscapes, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the ecosystem.",
