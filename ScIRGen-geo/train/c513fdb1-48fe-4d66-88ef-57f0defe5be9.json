            "description": "The content of the document includes the microscopic temperature measurement data of fluid inclusions in Hengdong cobalt deposit, Hunan Province. The experimental methods are as follows: the micro temperature measurement was carried out on the Linkam MDS 600 heating and freezing system of the Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry. Before measurement, the platform was calibrated using synthetic fluid inclusions containing pure H2O (ice melting and critical homogenization) and H2O-CO2 inclusions (CO2 triple point). The accuracy of temperature measurement is - 100% ° C and 25 ° C is between ±  zero point one ° C. At 25 ° C and 400 ° C is between ±  one ° C。 In the process of fluid inclusion testing, the heating rate is generally 0.2-5 ℃ / min, but it decreases to 0.1 ℃ / min near the freezing point and 0.2-0.5 ℃ / min near the homogenization temperature, so as to record the phase transformation accurately. In order to avoid inclusion burst, the freezing experiment was carried out. In addition, fluid inclusions in quartz captured along the same growth zone or cluster are interpreted to represent the major ore-forming fluids (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The vapor and solid compositions of individual fluid inclusions were measured by LabRAM hr800 laser Raman microscopy. An Ar + ion laser operating at 44 MW is used to generate 532 nm line excitation wavelength. The scanning range of the spectrum is set between 100 and 4000 cm-1, and the cumulative time of each scanning is 10 seconds. The spectral resolution is 0.65 cm-1. Before the analysis, the Raman shift of the silicon wafer is 520.7 cm-1. The data can be used for geochemical analysis of Hengdong cobalt deposit in Hunan and similar deposits in Northeast Hunan.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored as a word document.",

Factors such as the potential for inclusions to burst if not properly frozen and the need to calibrate measurement equipment using synthetic fluid inclusions further necessitate this precision. Accurate temperature control ensures reliable data for geochemical analysis, particularly in studies involving mineral deposits like the cobalt deposits in Hunan's Hengdong region.",
