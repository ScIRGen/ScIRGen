            "description": "Based on multiple data sources such as  MOD13Q1, human footprint, and elevation, we extracted variables, such as vegetation growth characteristics, local texture information, human activities, and terrain property. Utilizing machine learning and change detection methods, we generated the annual global forest maps from a forest management perspective. Forest management types were defined into six categories: natural regeneration forests (both unmanaged and managed), plantation forests (rotation >15 years and ≤15 years), oil palm plantations, and agroforestry. Point-scale validation results indicated an overall accuracy ranging from 75.55% to 96.26%. The annual forest management type data holds significant importance in understanding the fine composition of forests.",
