            "description": "Antarctic digital elevation model (DEM) is essential for human fieldwork, ice topography monitoring and ice mass change estimation. A new-generation satellite laser altimeter ICESat-2 is used to generate a new and specific time-stamped Antarctic DEM for both ice sheet and ice shelves. Approximately 4.69 × 109 ICESat-2 measurement points from November 2019 to November 2020 are used to estimate surface elevations at resolutions of 500 m and 1 km based on a spatiotemporal fitting method, which posts this DEM at a modal resolution of 500 m. About 74% of Antarctica are observed and the remaining observation gaps are interpolated using the ordinary kriging method. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne data are used to evaluate the generated Antarctic DEM (hereafter call it ICESat-2 DEM). Overall, a median bias of -0.19 m and root-mean-square deviation of 10.83 m are found from appropriately 5.2 × 106  spatiotemporal matched measurement points. The accuracy and uncertainty of ICESat-2 DEM vary in relation to the surface slope and roughness, more reliable estimates can be found in the flat ice sheet interior. ICESat-2 DEM is comparable to previous DEMs derived from satellite altimeters, stereo-photogrammetry and interferometry. The high accuracy and a specific time stamp make ICESat-2 DEM an essential addition to the existing Antarctic DEM groups and can be further used for other scientific applications.",

This model includes surface elevation information over the ice sheet and ice shelf areas, providing valuable data for human activities, monitoring ice morphologies, and estimating mass balance. The DEM is generated using approximately 4.7 billion ICESat-2 observations collected between November 2018 and November 2019, with a spatial resolution of 500 meters and temporal accuracy due to its clear timestamp.",

                    "Answer": "The digital surface elevation model generated using ICESat-2 has a high precision and clear timestamp, which supplements existing Antarctic DEM datasets. It covers the ice sheet and ice shelf areas and uses about 4.7 billion ICESat-2 observation points from November 2018 to November 2019. The method estimates the surface elevation of 74% of Antarctica at a spatial resolution of 500 meters, with the remaining elevation information obtained through kriging interpolation. The accuracy of ICESat-2 DEM is validated using airborne flight data from NASA's Operation IceBridge. The ICESat-2 DEM shows an average bias of approximately -0.19 meters and a root mean square deviation of about 10.83 meters from 5 million spatiotemporally matched observation points. Its accuracy and uncertainty are influenced by surface slope and roughness, providing more reliable observations over the inland ice sheet. This makes it comparable to existing DEMs generated from satellite altimetry, optical imagery, and radar interferometry.",
