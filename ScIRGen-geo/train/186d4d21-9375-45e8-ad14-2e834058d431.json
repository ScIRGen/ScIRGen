            "description": "The dataset includes FPAR, GPP, NPP, evapotranspiration product and LAI product. FPAR product is and LAI product are obtained from the MODIS Terra MOD15A2H dataset, GPP and NPP product are obtained from the MOD15A2H dataset and evapotranspiration product is obtained from MODIS Terra MOD16A2 dataset of 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau,which is downloaded from USGS, and their formats are converted from .hdf to .tif by GDAL.The quality assessment files are also included for aboved products,and they are stored in an efficient bit-encoded manner.The MODIS products play an important role in forest, agriculture, ecology. ",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: Different products are stored in different folders named by product short name, the name rule of each file is \"obtained MODIS dataset_date_product short name_500m.tif\",for example, MOD15A2H_2001017_Fpar_500m.tif, 2001 represents the year, 017 means the Julian date, and it means the \"best\" pixel available from all the acquisitions of the Terra sensor from within the 8-day period during 2001017 and 2001024 . 2)How to use the dataset: the dataset can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the Fpar data are multiplied 0.01 when used, and the background filling value is 249-255;the GPP and NPP are multiplied 0.0001, and the backgroud filling value is 32461-32767, LAI need to be multiplied 0.1, and the backgroud filling value is 249-255 and ET need to be multiplied 0.1 and the background filling value is 32671-32767.",
