            "description": "The dataset is the Landsat enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products from 2021 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the EVI equation which is added backgroud adjusted parameters C1 and C2, and atmospheric adjusted parameter L based on NDVI equation.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow. Compared with NDVI, EVI has stronger ability to resist atmospheric interference and noise,so it is more suitable for weather conditions with high aerosol content and lush vegetation areas.",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the EVI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the EVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-EVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-EVI;the EVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-EVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-EVI.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on,  the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",
