                    "Answer": "Temperature proxy data refers to indirect measures of past climate conditions, such as tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments, and historical documents, which can be used to infer temperature changes over time. These proxies are often utilized when direct temperature measurements are unavailable, and they provide valuable insights into climate variations over the past millennium, especially in regions like the Northern Hemisphere.",

                    "Answer": "Tree rings and ice cores are both used as proxy data for reconstructing past temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. Tree rings provide annual resolution data and are the most prevalent source with 370 entries, offering a high degree of precision in temperature reconstruction. In contrast, ice cores, with 15 entries, may provide longer-term climate signals but typically with lower temporal resolution. Both methods have undergone strict quality checks and temperature signal validation, ensuring their effectiveness for temperature reconstruction.",

                    "Answer": "In the process of temperature assimilation for the past millennium (1000-2000 AD) in the Northern Hemisphere, only annually resolved proxy data was retained to ensure the data's quality and reliability. This selection process was likely aimed at maintaining consistency in temporal resolution across the dataset, allowing for more accurate and comparable temperature reconstructions at both hemispheric and regional scales. Additionally, annually resolved data had undergone rigorous quality checks and temperature signal verification, further justifying their selection.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goals are to reconstruct hemispheric and regional temperature variations over the past millennium to understand historical climate changes. The data collection involves multiple proxies, including tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments, and historical documents, which have been quality-checked and validated for temperature signals. This helps in improving the accuracy of temperature assimilation processes and informing climate models.",
