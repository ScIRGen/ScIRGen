            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Zhangye-Yingke-Huazhaizi flight zone on Jun. 29, 2008.\n     Intra-band data available for general users include Level-2C data (after geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections), Level-1B browse image (after intra-band matching) and Level-2B browse image (after registration). The raw data, Level-1A, and data processing parameters were filed; applications would be evaluated prior to access. Data processing started in Aug. 2008 and ended in Apr. 2009, and in Nov. 2009, CCD data were reprocessed to adjust radiometric calibration. \n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id\n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 3#15 || 1500m || 10:54:47 || 11:10:55  || 123 || processed; complete || good\n|- \n| 2 || 3#13 || 1500m || 11:15:39 || 11:15:11  || 114 || processed; complete || good\n|-  \n| 3 || 3#10 || 1500m || 13:55:47 || 14:11:27  || 116 || processed; complete || good || the resort, Yingke weather station maize field and Yingke wheat field\n|-  \n| 4 || 3#9 || 1500m || 14:08:35 || 14:16:11 || 115 || processed; complete || good || the wetland park,Zhangye city,Yingke weather station maize field, Yingke wheat field, and Huazhaizi desert maize field \n|-\n| 5 || 3#7 || 1500m || 14:22:07 || 14:29:47 || 116 || processed; complete || good \n|-\n| 6 || 3#5 || 1500m || 14:34:15 || 14:41:43 || 113 || processed; complete || good || Huazhaizi desert plot 1\n|- \n| 7 || 3#3 || 1500m || 14:47:11 || 14:54:47 || 115 || processed; complete || good || Huazhaizi desert plot 2\n|- \n| 8 || 3#1 || 1500m || 14:57:51 || 15:13:03 || 109 || processed; complete || good\n|}",
