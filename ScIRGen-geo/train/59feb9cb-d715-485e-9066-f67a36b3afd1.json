            "description": "The West Kunlun region forms the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and sedimentation in this region contributed to plateau formation and its northwards expansion, as well as the development of central Asian aridification. However, the stratigraphic dating framework in this region has been ambiguous, hampering the understanding of both tectonic and environmental evolution. Here, palynological analysis was performed on the Xialafudie Formation in the West Kunlun region. Together with the palynological assemblage and megafossils found in the study section, as well as regional stratigraphic comparison, we conclude that the Xialafudie Formation was deposited during the Pliocene, and not Early Cretaceous as previously reported. The palynological assemblage of the section is mainly composed of drought-tolerant herbs and shrubs, and the percentage of conifers and broadleaved trees is very low, indicating that a dry and cold environment prevailed in the West Kunlun region during the Pliocene. Comprehensively analysed palynological data from the Tarim Basin and its surroundings show that aridification intensified in this part of central Asia during the Pliocene, as a result of long-term global cooling and regional tectonism.",

However, the stratigraphic dating framework in this region has been ambiguous, hampering the understanding of both tectonic and environmental evolution. Located in the continent interior, and bounded to the south by the Tibetan Plateau and to the north by the central Asian mountains, northwest China has become one of the hyper-arid regions in the world, and contains one of the world’s largest deserts. It provides a major dust source for the global aerosol system, affects biogeochemical cycles and water resources and plays an important role in dust-climate feedbacks. However, the timing of the formation and subsequent evolution of this arid environment are still debated. Estimates for when aridification began range from the Eocene to the Pliocene. The rain shadow of the Tibetan Plateau, Pamir, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountains, long-term global cooling, and retreat of the Paratethys are all envisaged to have enhanced the aridification of the Asian interior and the formation of the Taklamakan Desert. Few researchers have paid attention to the environmental changes in the West Kunlun region because of the chaotic stratigraphic age constraints, hampering the understanding of the evolution of aridification in the Asian interior. Researchers can use palynomorphs to determine the relative stratigraphic age, especially when other dating methods such as radiometric isotopes in volcanic ash, palaeomagnetism and mammalian stratigraphy can be or cannot be applied. Palynological analysis is also a good proxy to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment."

Field work was conducted in the Waqia area, Tashkurgan County, in 2018. At the same time, 60 palynological samples were collected at 0.5 m intervals. Four modern top-soil pollen samples were also collected near the section for comparison. All pollen samples were prepared using the standard pollen preparation method, including 10% HCl, 10% NaOH and 40% HF. Then, a 10-μm mesh was used to remove the fine fraction and concentrate pollen by ultrasonic sieving. Identifications were based on atlases of pollen and spores, as well as modern reference slides from the collection of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). All samples were counted to a terrestrial pollen sum of 300 pollen grains. Pollen and spore percentages were calculated based on the sum of terrestrial pollen. Palynological diagrams were illustrated using the software packages TILIA and TILIAGRAPH and pollen assemblage zones were constructed using CONISS."

This is in contrast to regions with clearer stratigraphic frameworks where dating may be more straightforward. The chaotic stratigraphic age constraints in the West Kunlun region make it difficult to correlate layers and require reliance on palynological analysis as a proxy, whereas other regions might utilize more direct dating methods like radiometric dating or palaeomagnetism without such constraints.",

                    "Answer": "Establishing a clear stratigraphic dating framework is important because the ambiguous stratigraphic dating has hampered the understanding of both tectonic and environmental evolution in the region, and it is crucial for understanding the evolution of aridification in the Asian interior.",

                    "Answer": "One major challenge is the ambiguous stratigraphic dating framework in the region, which complicates the understanding of environmental evolution. To address this, palynological analysis is used as a proxy to determine relative stratigraphic age, especially when other dating methods like radiometric isotopes, palaeomagnetism, and mammalian stratigraphy cannot be applied. Comprehensive regional stratigraphic comparisons and the use of palynological assemblage are employed to improve age determination.",

However, these expectations may not always be met due to factors like insufficient fossil preservation, limited sample size, or complex depositional environments that obscure clear signals in the pollen record.",

This ambiguity has led to difficulties in determining the timing of aridification processes in the Asian interior, particularly in the West Kunlun region, due to inconsistent age reporting of formations like the Xialafudie Formation. Reliance on palynomorphs for relative stratigraphic dating and the limited application of other dating methods add to these challenges.",
