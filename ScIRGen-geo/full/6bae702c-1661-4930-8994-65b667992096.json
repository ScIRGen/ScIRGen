            "description": "In South China, standard Carboniferous δ13Ccarb curves have been established, but the isotopic patterns and values in different sections and regions can be quite different. Before the use of δ13Ccarb records to reveal global marine carbon cycling, it is necessary to conduct sedimentary facies and diagenesis analyses and compare numerous isotopic records on a global scale, in order to learn the global versus local contribution in a δ13C record. 201 geochemical samples were collected from the Yueyahu Formation for carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses, in order to reveal carbon cycling process(the TICE event) in northern Qiangtang/or Songpan-Ganzi and evaluate alternation of carbon isotopic records during diagenesis. This dataset includes 201 carbon and oxygen isotopic records.",
            "instructions": "The file name is \"Carbon and oxygen isotopic features of marine carbonate rocks from the Shuangdiandaban section in Ali area, Tibet\", which is composed of research site (Ali area, Tibet) + section name (the Shuangdiandaban section) + data type (inorganic carbon and oxygen isotope geochemical data). The data is stored in XLS format and can be opened and read by Microsoft Office Excel software.",
