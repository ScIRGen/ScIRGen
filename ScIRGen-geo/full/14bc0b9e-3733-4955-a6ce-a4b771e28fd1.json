            "description": "This data set collects carbonate Sr, Mg and Ca compositions of bedrock (silicate and carbonate) and sediment (topsoils, sand, fluvial sediments, and aeolian sediments) on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau published before 2015. In the data processing method, after removing the soluble salt with water and dissolving by dilute acetic acid, the contents of Sr, Mg and Ca in supernatant are measured by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry). The data are obtained according to laboratory standards, and the relative standard deviation of Sr, Mg and Ca tests is less than 2%. \nThe data set consists of six forms, which are silicate rocks, carbonate rocks, topsoils, sand, fluvial sediments and aeolian sediments.\nThere are 7 fields in the data sheets.\nField 1: \"Ca\", carbonate Ca content in bedrock and sediment,\nField 2: \"Mg\", carbonate Mg content in bedrock and sediment\nField 3: \"Sr\", carbonate Sr content in bedrock and sediment\nField 4: \"Mg/Ca\", carbonate Mg/Ca in bedrock and sediment \nField 5: \"Sr/Ca\", carbonate Sr/Ca ratio in bedrock and sediment\nField 6: \"Type\", bedrock type\nField 7: \"Source\", data source\nDimensions (units of measurement):\n“Ca”: ppm，“Mg”： ppm; “Sr”： ppm， “Mg/Ca”： mmol/mol， “Sr/Ca”： mmol/mol",

                    "Answer": "Variability in carbonate composition measurements could arise from factors such as sample heterogeneity, differences in data collection methods like the effectiveness of soluble salt removal with water, the precision of the ICP-OES measurement process, and the inherent variability in the carbonate content of different rock and sediment types. Additionally, discrepancies in lab standards and potential human error during data processing might contribute to this variability.",
