            "description": "The dataset of snow density measurements was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental area on Dec. 6 and Dec. 10, 2007 during the pre-observation period, to survey the snow layer and acquire the snow density for retrieval and modeling from remote sensing approaches. \n     Observation items included:\n     (1) Snow layer density: measured by snow shovel weighing method. Each 10cm was a unit.  \n     (2) Snow density, snow depth, snow temperature, snow-soil interface temperature, and snow grain size in BG-A. \n     Measured were carried out in BG-A on Dec. 6, 2007, and in BG-B, BG-C and BG-D on Dec. 10, 2007. The dataset includes raw data and processed data plus GPS and calibration data for the snow shovel.",

In this method, snow is collected using a snow shovel and its weight is measured to assess the density. During the pre-experiment, layered density measurements are conducted at 10 cm intervals. For layers less than 10 cm thick, one measurement is taken, while for layers greater than 10 cm, density measurements are taken in multiple layers.",
