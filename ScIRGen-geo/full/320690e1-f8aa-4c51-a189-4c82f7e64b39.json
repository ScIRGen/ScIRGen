            "description": "The Landuse/Landcover data of the Heihe River Basin in 2000 ( newly compiled in 2012), was finished by the Remote Sensing Laboratory of Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using satellite remote sensing, based on the LandsaTM and ETM remote sensing data around 2000, combing field investigation and verification, thus leading to the establishment of the Heihe River Basin 1:10. 10,000 land use/land cover imagery and vector database. The main contents are: 1:100,000 land use graphic data and attribute data in the Heihe River Basin.\nThe Heihe River Basin 1:100,000 (2011) land cover data and the previous land cover data use the same layered land cover classification system, the whole basin is divided into six first-class categories (cultivated land, woodland, grassland, waters, urban and rural residents, industrial and mining land and unused land), 25 secondary classes; data types are vector polygons, stored as Shape format. Land cover classification attributes:\nPrimary type, secondary type, attribute coding, spatial distribution position\n\nCultivated land:\n Plain dry land, 123, is mainly distributed in basin, Piedmont zone, river alluvial, diluvial plain or lacustrine plain (lack of water, irrigation condition is poor).\nHilly dry land, 122, is mainly distributed in Hilly areas. Generally speaking, land blocks distribute on gentle slopes, ridges and mats of hills.\nMountainous dry land, 121, is mainly distributed in mountainous areas, with the elevation below 4000 meters (gentle slope, mountainside, steep slope platform, etc.) and the Piedmont zones.\n\nWoodland: \nThere is woodland (arbor), 21, is mainly distributed in the mountains (below 4000 meters ) or on the slopes of the mountains, valleys, hills, plains and so on.\nShrub land, 22, is mainly distributed in higher mountain areas (below 4500 meters), most of which distribute in hillsides, valleys and sandy land.\nSparse forest land, 23, is mainly distributed in the mountains, hills, plains and sandy land, and on the edge of the Gobi (loam, gravel).\nOther woodlands, 24, are mainly distributed in the oasis field, around rivers, roadsides and rural settlements.\n\nGrassland:\n Highly covered grassland, 31, is mainly distributed in mountainous areas (slow slopes), hills (steep slopes) and inter-river beaches, Gobi, sand dunes, etc.\n Mid-covered grassland, 32, is mainly distributed in relatively dry areas (Gobi, low-lying land and sandy land,sand dunes, etc.).\nThe low-cover grassland, 33, grows mainly in drier areas (on the loess hills and on the edge of the sand).\n\nWaters: \nChannel, 41 is mainly distributed in plains, inter-river cultivated land and inter-mountain valleys.\n\nLake, 42, is mainly distributed in low-lying areas.\nReservoir pit, 43, is mainly distributed in plains and valleys between rivers, surrounded by residential areas and cultivated land.\nGlacier and permanent snow cover, 44, mainly distribute at the top of (over 4000) alpine regions.\nFlood land, 46, is mainly distributed in the high and low hillside gullies, the piedmont, the plain lowlands, and the edge of the river and lake basins.\n\nResidents land: \nUrban land, 51, is mainly distributed in plains, mountain basins, slopes and valleys.\nRural residential land, 52, are mainly distributed in oases, cultivated land and roadsides, on the tablelands and the slopes.\nIndustrial land and traffic land, 53, are generally distributed in the periphery of towns, areas with fairly developed transportation and industrial mining areas.\n\nUnutilized land: \nSandy land, 61, is mostly distributed in the basin, on both sides of the river, in the river bay and on the periphery of the Piedmont and Gobi.\nGobi, 62, is mainly distributed in the Piedmont belt with strong wind erosion and sediment transport.\nSaline and alkaline land, 63, is mainly distributed in dry lakes, lakeside and areas relatively low with easy water accumulation. \nSwamp, 64, is mainly distributed in relatively low areas with easy water accumulation.\nBare soil, 65, is mainly distributed in arid areas (steep hillsides, hills and gobi), with vegetation coverage less than 5%.\nBare rock, 66, is mainly distributed in extremely arid rocky mountainous areas (windy and rainless).\nThe other, 67 mainly distributes in bare rocks formed by freezing and thawing above 4000 meters, also known as alpine tundra.",

This system divides the land into categories such as cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water bodies, residential areas, and unused land. Each category is further divided into subcategories, which are assigned specific attribute codes and are typically represented in vector polygon format for spatial analysis.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection techniques for creating a land use/land cover dataset using satellite remote sensing involve the use of satellite data such as Landsat TM and ETM, which provide a comprehensive spatial coverage and allow for a classification system that divides the entire Heihe River Basin into six primary categories and twenty-five secondary categories. These techniques offer high spatial resolution at a scale of 1:100,000. In contrast, traditional field surveys often involve manual data collection methods that can provide detailed ground-truth data but may lack the broad spatial coverage and efficiency of satellite remote sensing. Therefore, while satellite remote sensing provides extensive spatial data efficiently, field surveys can enhance accuracy through ground verification.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity arises from the diverse landscape features and land use types within the Heihe River Basin. The classification system divides the region into various categories like farmland, forests, grasslands, water bodies, residential areas, and unused land, each with subcategories. The spatial distribution of these types, from plains and hills to mountainous areas, poses challenges in distinguishing between them accurately using satellite imagery. Furthermore, the varying conditions such as elevation, vegetation density, and human activities could affect the accuracy of classification.",

The data is complemented by field surveys for validation. The land cover classification system divides the region into six primary categories (arable land, forest land, grassland, water bodies, residential and industrial land, and unused land) and 25 secondary categories. The data is stored in vector polygon format using the Shape file format. Classification attributes include primary and secondary types, attribute codes, and spatial distribution locations.",
