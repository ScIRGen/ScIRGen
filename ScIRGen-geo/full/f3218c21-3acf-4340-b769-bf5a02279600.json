            "description": "This dataset includes data recorded by the Heihe integrated observatory network obtained from the automatic weather station (AWS) at the observation system of Meteorological elements gradient of Dashalong station from January 1 to December 31, 2023. The site (98.941° E, 38.840° N) was located on a swamp meadow surface in the Longshatan, which is near west of Qilian county, Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3739 m. The installation heights and orientations of different sensors and measured quantities were as follows: air temperature and humidity profile (HMP45C; 5 m, north), wind speed and direction profile (windsonic; 10 m, north), air pressure (PTB110; in the tamper box on the ground), rain gauge (TE525M; 10 m), four-component radiometer (CNR1; 6 m, south), two infrared temperature sensors (SI-111; 6 m, south, vertically downward), soil heat flux (HFP01; 3 duplicates, -0.06 m), soil temperature profile (109ss-L; 0, -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m), and soil moisture profile (CS616; -0.04, -0.1, -0.2, -0.4, -0.8, -1.2, and -1.6 m).\nThe observations included the following: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5 m; RH_5 m) (℃ and %, respectively), wind speed (Ws_10 m) (m/s), wind direction (WD_10 m) (°), air pressure (press) (hpa), precipitation (rain) (mm), four-component radiation (DR, incoming shortwave radiation; UR, outgoing shortwave radiation; DLR_Cor, incoming longwave radiation; ULR_Cor, outgoing longwave radiation; Rn, net radiation) (W/m^2), infrared temperature (IRT_1 and IRT_2) (℃), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2 and Gs_3) (W/m^2), soil temperature (Ts_0 cm, Ts_4 cm, Ts_10 cm, Ts_20 cm, Ts_40 cm, Ts_80 cm, Ts_120 cm, and Ts_160 cm) (℃), and soil moisture (Ms_4 cm, Ms_10 cm, Ms_20 cm, Ms_40 cm, Ms_80 cm, Ms_120 cm, and Ms_160 cm) (%, volumetric water content).\nThe data processing and quality control steps were as follows: (1) The AWS data were averaged over intervals of 10 min for a total of 144 records per day. The missing data were denoted by -6999. (2) Data in duplicate records were rejected. (3) Unphysical data were rejected. (4) The data marked in red are problematic data. (5) The format of the date and time was unified, and the date and time were collected in the same column, for example, date and time: 2023-9-10 10:30. (6) Finally, the naming convention was AWS+ site no. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) and Che et al. (2019).",

The eddy covariance (EC) method has been widely applied to measure the exchange of energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere. Currently, this technique is considered a standard method for measuring surface fluxes. Nevertheless, the EC method has limitations. Reliable measurements are restricted by many factors, such as complex conditions (e.g., topography and unfavorable weather), and corrections need to be applied when processing the turbulence data. Additionally, one of the most important problems is the “energy imbalance” in applying the EC data to the energy budget.

The surface characteristics in the source areas changed with the season at each site, and there were characteristic seasonal variations in the energy balance components at all of the sites. The sensible heat flux was the main term of the energy budget during the dormant season. During the growing season, however, the latent heat flux dominated the energy budget, and an obvious “oasis effect” was observed at YK. The sensible heat fluxes measured by LAS at AR were larger than those measured by EC at the same site.

The TSEB model uses composite land surface temperature as input and applies a simplified Priestley–Taylor formulation to partition this temperature into soil and vegetation component temperatures and then computes subsequent component energy fluxes. Accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) have a wide range of applications in hydrology, climate, weather and crop yield forecasting, drought monitoring, and water resource management. Ground-based measurements from lysimeters or from eddy covariance flux tower observations can provide representative values of ET at field scale and with high frequency eddy covariance data it’s partitioning into E and T under certain environmental conditions. To address the need for large scale spatially distributed ET, several remote sensing based approaches using the satellite-based thermal infrared (TIR) and visible and near infrared (VNIR) imagery have been developed and refined in recent years. Compared with the OSM-contextual based approaches, the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) is more physical-based since the parameterizations explicitly treat the radiative temperature and energy exchanges between soil and vegetation, and soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface. There have been great advances in the application of thermal infrared remote sensing for using the TSEB model to estimate land surface ET and its component of E and T."

Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer.

                "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

The estimated E/ET% and E/ET% values agreed well with the values observed using the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes technique during the early, middle, and late growing seasons.

In parallel, recent climate change, human activities, and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. Water resources in the alpine region are headwaters that need to be regulated to sustain downstream ecosystems. However, perturbations induced by nature/climate change and human activities in recent years have significantly reformed hydrological processes and eco-functions. Accurate estimation and prediction of hydrological processes and their key impact factors has since become crucial.",
                "Unfortunately, the scarcity of observation data in the alpine region, due to the difficulties of access and technological barriers, has hindered alpine hydrological modeling and associated research yet motivated the development of next-generation ecosystem observation networks and experiments. In comparison with the observations, using remote sensing data combined with data assimilation could improve the prediction of hydrological processes. However, due to the complexities of the earth system, there exist various sources of uncertainties in remote sensing data (especially in the alpine region), which have to be validated and calibrated. In summary, to fill the knowledge gap and promote alpine region hydrology research, an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation dataset is essential and expected to provide accurate forcing data for hydrological modeling, validate remote sensing data, allow the evaluation of distributed models and ultimately improve a predictive understanding of alpine hydrological processes and ecosystem functions. In alpine hydrology, in addition to consistent hydrometeorological data obtained from distributed meteorological stations, snow cover and frozen ground are two important indexes and driving forces that manipulate hydrological processes. The maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) before ablation determines the storage of snowmelt – a major source of freshwater in the alpine region, while freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) and soil moisture within the active layer alter water infiltration and, consequently, surface runoff and groundwater. To promote alpine hydrology research, the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (INARCH) was launched in 2015 by the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), involving 18 catchments around the world. The INARCH has since connected individual observatories into an international network and data-share platform to lead frontier research on alpine region hydrometeorology and snow observation. Another community-based observation network, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, was initiated in the early 1990s to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China and is known for its heterogeneous landscapes, diverse ecosystems, unique geographical characteristics and climate change over recent decades. As a major component of the ecohydrological processes in the arid/semi-arid HRB, the alpine hydrological processes, especially those related to snow cover and frozen ground in the upper reaches, have great impacts on runoff in the mountainous region, which then regulate agricultural development in the middle reaches and the ecosystems of the lower reaches.",
                "In recent years, with climate warming, permafrost degradation has significantly affected runoff and the carbon cycle (Peng et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018). Snow cover is widely distributed with unique characteristics in the study area. In the high-altitude mountainous region (elevation > 3800 m), influenced by the local microclimate and low temperature, snowfall could occur in any season. Temporary snow is the major snow cover type in the region at middle and low elevations because strong solar radiation and high air temperature lead to fast melting and sublimation of the snow. Drifting snow is also commonly observed in the region, which may lead to the redistribution of snowpack in high elevation regions (Essery et al., 1999; Li et al., 2014).",
