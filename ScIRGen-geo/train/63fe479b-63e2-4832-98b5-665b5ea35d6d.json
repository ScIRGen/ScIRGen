            "description": "Three different data sources are used, including maps of the early Republic of China in 1920s, digital topographic maps in 1960 and Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI images from 1970 to 2020. In 1920s, the maps were scanned, geometrically corrected and georeferenced. In the 1960s, 1:250000 topographic maps were used. All maps are georeferenced by Albers Equivalent Conical Projection, and the root mean square (RMS) error is less than 1.5 pixels. For the early maps, visual interpretation and manual digitization were chosen to vectorize the lake boundaries. Since 1990, the semi-automatic water body classification method has been used to distinguish water body and non water body information from Landsat images, and then the lake boundary has been extracted, and visual inspection and manual editing have been carried out by comparing with the original Landsat images.",

                    "Answer": "The creation of a time-series dataset of lake areas over the past 100 years involves utilizing multiple data sources including 1920s maps, 1960s digital topographic maps, and 1970-2020 Landsat images. The process begins with scanning, geometrically correcting, and geographically referencing the 1920s maps. The 1960s data involves using 1:250,000 scale topographic maps, all geographically referenced using Albers conic projection with a root mean square error of less than 1.5 pixels. Early maps require manual vectorization by visual interpretation and digitization of lake boundaries. From 1990 onwards, a semi-automatic water classification method is applied to Landsat images to distinguish water from non-water areas, followed by extraction of lake boundaries. These are then visually checked and manually edited by comparing with the original Landsat images.",
