            "description": "As one of the most complete archaic human fossils, the Harbin cranium provides critical evidence for studying the diversification of the Homo genus and the origin of Homo sapiens. However, the unsystematic recovery of this cranium and a long and confused history since the discovery impede its accurate dating. Here, we carried out a series of geochemical analyses, including non-destructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF), rare earth elements (REE), and the Sr isotopes, to test the reported provenance of the Harbin cranium and get better stratigraphic constraints. The results show that the Harbin cranium has very similar XRF element distribution patterns, REE concentration patterns, and Sr isotopic compositions to those of the Middle Pleistocene-Holocene mammalian and human fossils recently recovered from the Harbin area. The sediments adhered in the nasal cavity of the Harbin cranium have a 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.711898, falling in the variation range measured in a core drilled near the Dongjiang Bridge, where the cranium was discovered during its reconstruction.  The regional stratigraphic correlations indicate that the Harbin cranium was probably from the upper part of the Upper Huangshan Formation of the Harbin area, which has an optically stimulated luminescence dating constraint between 138 and 309 ka. \nU-series disequilibrium dating (n = 10) directly on the cranium suggests that the cranium is older than 146 ka. The multiple lines of evidence from our experiments consistently support the theory that the Harbin cranium is from the late Middle Pleistocene of the Harbin area. Our study also shows that geochemical approaches can provide reliable evidence for locating and dating unsystematically recovered human fossils, and potentially can be applied to other human fossils without clear provenance and stratigraphy records.",

                    "Answer": "Geochemical analysis methods such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), rare earth elements (REE), and strontium isotopes (Sr) can be used to determine the stratigraphic origin and dating of hominin fossils. These methods help detect and limit the stratigraphic information by analyzing the elemental distribution patterns, enrichment modes of rare earth elements, and compositions of Sr isotopes in the fossil and surrounding sediments. In the case of the Harbin hominin fossil, such analyses indicated similarities in these geochemical signatures with those found in the Middle to Upper Pleistocene mammalian and human fossils in the Harbin area. Specifically, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the sediments attached to the skull matched the range of the core measurements near the discovery site, suggesting the fossil originated from the Upper Huangshan Formation of the Harbin region. This multilayered evidence supports the theory of the fossil's Middle Pleistocene origin, demonstrating how geochemical methods can provide reliable evidence for the localization and dating of unsystematically recovered hominin fossils, potentially applicable to other fossils without clear provenance and stratigraphic records.",
