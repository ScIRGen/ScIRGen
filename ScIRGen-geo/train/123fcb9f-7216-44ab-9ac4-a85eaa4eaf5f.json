            "description": "1) Population attribute function (PAF) and excess death (ED) values corresponding to the administrative districts along the Mekong River in Cambodia and southern Vietnam are calculated, where PAF reflects the comprehensive health risk of using high arsenic groundwater, and ED is the estimated number of additional deaths caused by drinking high arsenic groundwater in each administrative district every year.\n2) The sources of water arsenic data points used to calculate PAF and ED values are resource development international water quality database, UNICEF administered well database (Cambodia) and the Department of water resources management (Vietnam). The population data are derived from the census reports of the two countries in 2019. The data author is one of the authors of the article.\n3) The data calculation uses 95421 water arsenic data points covering 241 administrative regions and the latest census data, which provides sufficient reference for risk assessment of high arsenic drinking water for each administrative district.\n4) Taking the administrative region as the unit, this study comprehensively calculates and evaluates the health risk of high arsenic groundwater along the Mekong River in Cambodia and southern Vietnam, and provides an important reference for disease prevention and control and treatment policies in the two places in the future.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methods employed by the Resource Development International water quality database in Cambodia and the Department of Water Resources Management in Vietnam likely differ in terms of coverage and data granularity, as they cater to different national contexts and administrative requirements. The Resource Development International database, along with the UNICEF administered well database, provides data specifically tailored for Cambodia, while the Department of Water Resources Management focuses on Vietnamese data. These methods contribute to calculating the Population Attribute Function (PAF) and Excess Death (ED) numbers, which assess the health risks and estimated additional deaths due to high arsenic groundwater use in the respective regions.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating multiple national databases allows for a comprehensive assessment of health risks by providing a larger and more diverse set of water arsenic data points. This integration can result in more accurate Population Attribute Function (PAF) and Excess Death (ED) calculations, offering a detailed understanding of the health risks across different administrative regions in Cambodia and Vietnam. By using data from sources such as the Resource Development International water quality database, the UNICEF administered well database, and the Department of Water Resources Management, researchers can ensure a robust analysis that informs disease prevention and policy-making in regions affected by high arsenic groundwater.",

These data points cover 241 administrative districts with a total of 95,421 water arsenic data points. The population data for these regions are sourced from the 2019 national census reports of Cambodia and Vietnam. This comprehensive data collection approach provides a robust foundation for calculating Population Attribute Function (PAF) and Excess death (ED) values, which in turn inform the health risk assessments for arsenic exposure.",
