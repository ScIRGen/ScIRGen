            "description": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS whole rock geochemical composition, and TIMS Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition show that the monzonitic granites in Muhuguan and mangling intrusions on the northern margin of the North Qinling terrane have high SiO2 content (69.3 – 77.0 wt.), low Mg value (0.21 – 0.38), rich LREE, th, u and Pb, and depleted HFSE, And there is a negative Eu anomaly. According to the monzogranite of mangling pluton has higher Sr / y, (dy / Yb) n and (LA / Yb) N ratios, lower SiO2 content and no obvious negative Eu anomaly, it is speculated that the monzogranite of mangling pluton originated deeper than that of Muhuguan pluton. SR Nd isotopic characteristics show that the granites of the Muhuguan and mangling plutons have similar magma sources, and both of them are derived from heterogeneous magma sources. Zircon U-Pb dating results can be divided into two types: (1) magmatic zircon (153-140 MA)（ 2) The inherited zircons can be divided into five groups: Neoarchean Paleoproterozoic, Paleoproterozoic Mesoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic, Paleozoic and late Paleozoic early Mesozoic. Geochemical characteristics of the granites in the Muhuguan and mangling plutons indicate that they originated from the mixing of Neoproterozoic lower crust and ancient basement materials in the North Qinling Mountains. The lower radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions of the Muhuguan and mangling plutons also support the participation of basement materials in the southern margin of North China. The data comes from the scientific research project \"national key research and development plan\" deep process and resource effect of Yanshanian major geological events \"(2016YFC0600404)\".",

                    "Answer": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating provides precise age determinations, particularly useful for understanding the temporal framework of magmatic events, while XRF and ICP-MS methods focus on the overall geochemical composition, offering insights into elemental abundances and isotopic characteristics. Each method has its specific applicability: LA-ICP-MS is crucial for age dating, whereas XRF and ICP-MS are essential for comprehensive geochemical analysis.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of analytical techniques like LA-ICP-MS, XRF, and ICP-MS is influenced by the need to accurately measure the geochemical composition of granitic rocks, including SiO2 content, Mg# values, and the presence of elements like LREE, Th, U, and Pb. These methods allow for detailed analysis of both whole-rock geochemical compositions and isotopic compositions, which are essential for understanding the magmatic source and processes, as well as the depth of origin of granitic bodies like those in the North Qinling terrane.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of analyzing granitoid bodies like those in the North Qinling terrane, LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) is used for zircon U-Pb dating by first selecting zircon crystals from the rock samples. These crystals are then mounted, polished, and ablated using a laser to generate aerosols. These aerosols are then ionized in the plasma and analyzed by mass spectrometry to obtain isotopic ratios, which are used to calculate the U-Pb ages of the zircons, providing insights into the crystallization age of the rock bodies.",
