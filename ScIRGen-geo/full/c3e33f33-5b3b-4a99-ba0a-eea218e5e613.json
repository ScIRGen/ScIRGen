            "description": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate the activity of target genes by participating in the organization of chromatin architecture.   We have devised a “chromatin-RNA in situ reverse transcription sequencing” (CRIST-seq) approach to profile the lncRNA interaction network in gene regulatory elements by combining the simplicity of RNA biotin labeling with the specificity of the CRISPR Cas9 system.  Using gene-specific gRNAs, we describe a pluripotency-specific lncRNA interacting network in the promoters of Sox2 and Pou5f1, two critical stem cell factors that are required for the maintenance of pluripo\u0002tency.       The promoter-interacting lncRNAs were specifically activated during reprogramming into pluripotency.       Knockdown of these lncRNAs caused the stem cells to exit from pluripotency.      In contrast, overexpression of the pluripotency-associated lncRNA activated the promoters of core stem cell factor genes and enhanced fibroblast reprogramming into pluripotency.    These CRIST-seq data suggest that the Sox2 and Pou5f1 promoters are organized within a unique lncRNA interaction network that determines the fate of pluripotency during reprogramming.       This CRIST approach may be broadly used to map lncRNA interaction networks at target loci across the genome.",
