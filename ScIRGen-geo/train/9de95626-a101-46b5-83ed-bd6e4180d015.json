            "description": "The separation of zircon was completed by heavy liquid and magnetic separation in the laboratory of Hebei geological team. Cathodoluminescence images are used to observe the internal structure of zircon particles, and appropriate points are selected for analysis and research. U. Th and Pb were determined in La ⁃ ICP ⁃ ms of Qinghai Tibet Plateau Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences. For detailed analysis methods, see Li et al. (2009). Zircon standard sample and zircon sample are determined alternately in the ratio of 1 ∶ 3. The U ⁃ th ⁃ Pb isotope ratio was corrected with the standard zircon pl é sovice (337 Ma, SL á Ma et al., 2008), and the standard sample Qinghu (159.5 Ma, Li et al., 2009) was used as the accuracy of the monitoring data of the unknown sample. The isotopic ratio and age error are all 1 σ。 The data results are processed by isoplot software (Ludwig, 2001). On the basis of zircon u ⁃ Pb dating, select the age point with good harmony, and delineate the Hf isotope point in the micro area consistent with the ring trend of the age point. Zircon Hf isotope analysis is carried out on Neptune Plusma II multi receiver plasma mass spectrometer and nwr193uc 193 nm laser sampling system. See Liu et al. (2008) for detailed steps of the instrument. The diameter of laser ablation spot beam is generally 60 μ m. Each measuring point includes 10 s pre denudation, 45 s denudation and 30 s cleaning time. During the sample test, 91500 is taken as the standard sample, and its 176hf / 177hf = 0.282 286 ± 12 (2 σ， n = 21）。",

                    "Answer": "The zircon samples are separated using heavy liquid and magnetic separation methods at the Hebei Provincial Geological Team Laboratory. Cathodoluminescence imaging is used to observe the internal structure of zircon grains and to select appropriate points for analysis. U, Th, and Pb determinations are conducted at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using LA-ICP-MS. Zircon standards and samples are alternately measured at a ratio of 1:3, with standard zircon Plésovice used for U-Th-Pb isotopic ratio calibration and Qinghu as an unknown sample for monitoring data accuracy. Isotope ratios and age errors are 1σ. Data processing uses ISOPLOT software. For Hf isotopic analysis, points with good concordance are selected based on U-Pb dating. Hf isotope analysis is performed using the Neptune Plusma II multi-collector plasma mass spectrometer and the NWR193UC 193 nm laser sampling system, with detailed procedures in Liu et al. (2008). The laser ablation spot size is generally 60 μm, with each measurement point including 10 s of pre-ablation, 45 s of ablation, and 30 s of cleaning time. The sample test uses 91500 as the standard, with 176Hf/177Hf = 0.282 286±12 (2σ, n = 21).",
