                "Land surface albedo is an important parameter to describe the radiant forcing in the climate system. A long-time series of global albedo products is needed to understand the mechanism of climate change. As the effects of global warming become more and more drastic, there comes an urgent demand to understand the global climate system as well as its influence on and reaction to environmental change or human activities. Land surface albedo is one of the major radiant forcing factors in the climate system because the albedo determines how much solar radiation will be absorbed at the land surface. Therefore, satellite remote sensing is the most effective technique to map the spatial and temporal distribution of the global land surface albedo. As a result of the advances in quantitative remote sensing research, many global or regional land surface albedo products have been released. The MODIS MCD43 series of BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) and albedo products, generated by NASAâ€™s MODLAND team, provide a global albedo map in a continuous time series from 2000 to the present. The MCD43 series of products are the most complete and widely recognized data-set for the global albedo, and their algorithm has a profound influence on other albedo inversion algorithms. Global change studies demand spatially complete and long-term global albedo products. To fill this gap, several international research projects have been devoted to the generation of long-term global albedo products by combining remote sensing data from different sensors/satellites."

It is critical to assess the quality of the GLASS product when it is released to the public. The work presented in this article provides the basic description of GLASS albedo product and gives a first-chance evaluation of its quality in the sense of integrity, robustness, and accuracy."

Although these algorithms are optimized in a statistical way, they certainly cannot account for all the situations of the complex real world. The a-priori database, which is critical in the STF algorithm, is derived from the MCD43B3 product; thus, this database inherits the limitations of the MCD43B3 product, such as insufficient samples in the tropical rain forest areas. The A VHRR data have limitations in the band number, calibration accuracy, and geometric processing accuracy. The evaluation work presented in this paper is also limited in data source as well as methodology."

To check the consistency of the GLASS albedo product with the MCD43 product, we choose the GLASS02A06 product and MCD43B3 product which have exactly the same spatial coordinates and resolution, as well as similar temporal composition window."
