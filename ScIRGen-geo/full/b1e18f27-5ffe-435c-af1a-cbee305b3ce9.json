            "description": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role in maintaining the function and sustainability of grassland ecosystem, we investigated AMF communities richness and composition in 144 root samples from 48 plant species in a Tibetan alpine grassland using Illumina-MiSeq sequencing of 18S rRNA gene. The results showed that 129 AMF molecular species (6 families, 9 genera) were obtained from 48 common plant roots, meaning the alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau is rich in AMF species resources. Different plant roots have different AMF diversity and community structure, among which the number of Glomus sequences and the abundance of OTU are the largest. The construction of alpine grassland plant AMF diversity data provides support for understanding the pattern of coexistence of alpine grassland plants and AMF, the mechanism of community construction and the dynamic law of community, and is of great significance for understanding the alpine grassland community structure, species evolution and biodiversity.",

                "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are an ancient root symbiotic group, whose origin is consistent with the first appearance of terrestrial plants, and generally considered to be the result of coevolution of fungi and plants. As a key component of the underground biological community, AMF can form a symbiotic relationship with most terrestrial plant species and can increase the absorption of phosphorus and nitrogen for plants. The combination of AMF and plants improves the adaptability of plants and AMF symbionts. Furthermore, the plant-AMF symbioses are not formed stochastically but are dependent on their functional traits. Due to the simultaneous processes of coevolution, niche differentiation, and niche conservatism, the closely related plants tend to interact with similar AMF species (i.e., phylogenetic signal in the interaction). Many studies have shown that phylogenetic relatedness affects the mycorrhizal symbiotic network structure, which could answer the question of how coevolution explained species assemblages. The network is increasingly used to study co-occurrence patterns in plant and AMF symbioses, providing insights for biological interactions. Most of the studies on the plant-fungus symbiotic network focused on temperate and tropical ecosystems, and the research objects were mainly woody plant-AMF symbiotic interactions. However, herbaceous plant-AMF network characteristics in the alpine ecosystems remain poorly understood. As the Third Pole on the earth, the Tibetan Plateau is a unique geographic unit with great biodiversity and critical ecosystem functions and is experiencing striking climate warming. The importance of AMF in plant succession on the Tibetan plateau has been well documented. However, most of the studies focused on the effects of altitude gradients, precipitation, and vegetation types on AMF community composition. The selectivity of the interactions between the plant and AMF and their network properties in Tibetan alpine meadows remains unclear."

                "In mid-August 2018, 23 representative plant species were selected based on a vegetation survey in the alpine meadow of Naqu county. Notably, 23 sampling sites were randomly chosen for plant sampling around the Kaima Station, which was at least 50 m away from each other to avoid interactions among plant species. Then, three 0.5 × 0.5 m² quadrats were randomly selected in each sampling site, and three plant individuals in each quadrat were collected and pooled as one composite sample. Plant roots were carefully separated from aboveground parts and soil, packaged in plastic bags, refrigerated and transported to the laboratory, and stored at −2°C for colonization determination and DNA extraction. Total DNA was extracted from a 0.05 g (freeze-dried) subsample of fine roots using a PowerPlant DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, United States) following the instructions of manufacturer. A two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The primers used in the first PCR were NS31 and AML2 and the second PCR amplification with the primers AMV4.5NF and AMDGR. The PCR products were purified with an agarose gel DNA purification kit and quantified using a NanoDrop 8000. The purified products were pooled in equimolar amounts and then sequenced on the Illumina-MiSeq platform. We used the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and the UPARSE pipeline to treat raw sequences as described previously. Sequence quality control was conducted with QIIME, and the obtained high-quality sequences were imported into a Usearch (vision 11). The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered at 97% similarity. The representative sequences of OTUs were uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and MarrjAM database for taxonomy identification."

The high connected and nested plant-AMF network potentially promoted the interdependence and stability of the plant-AMF symbioses in Tibetan alpine meadows."

The roots were separated from soil, packaged, refrigerated, and stored for DNA extraction. Illumina-MiSeq sequencing was used to analyze AMF communities living in plant roots. DNA was extracted from freeze-dried root subsamples following specific protocols, amplified by PCR, and sequenced. Quality control and OTU clustering were conducted using QIIME and UPARSE pipelines.",
