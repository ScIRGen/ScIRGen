            "description": "In order to better understand the mechanism of the interaction between the global climate and the Fimbu and Jelbart ice shelves, it is important to obtain the long-term ice velocity changes in this region. 1960-1980s Ice Flow Velocity Field Data Product Set of the Fimbul and Jelbart Ice Shelves, East Antarctica: Using the early Argon, Landsat MSS and TM satellite images, based on pre-processing the early remote sensing images to obtain the orthophoto images with precise geometric status, a layered matching method under the constraint strategy of artificial point feature point grid point was proposed, and the historical ice flow velocity field data product of the Fimbul Jelbart Ice Shelf, East Antarctica was extracted. This study is of great significance for studying the historical ice velocity of the Fimbul Jelbart Ice Shelf in East Antarctica from 1963 to 1987, and can provide basic data for studying the response of the ice sheet to global climate change.",

This can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between global climate and ice shelves, providing foundational data for studying the ice sheet's response to global climate change.
