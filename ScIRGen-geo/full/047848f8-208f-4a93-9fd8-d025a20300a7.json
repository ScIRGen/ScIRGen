Oliver in 1973, the temperature-humidity index of thethe Green Silk Road Countries(GSRCs) is calculated based on the annual average temperature and relative humidity. The climate suitability assessment of human settlements of the  GSRCs  is carried out on the basis of the temperature-humidity index. the climate suitability of human settlements in different areas of GSRCs can be divided into five categories: Non-suitable area,Critically suitable area, Low suitable area, Moderately suitable area and High suitable area, based on the distribution characteristics of temperature-humidity index and its correlation with population distribution, according to the regional characteristics and differences of temperature and relative humidity, and referring to the physiological climate evaluation standard of temperature-humidity index.",

Oliver's formula from 1973, allows for a nuanced evaluation of climate suitability along the Silk Road by factoring in both annual average temperature and relative humidity. This approach categorizes the habitability of environments into five levels: unsuitable, marginally suitable, generally suitable, relatively suitable, and highly suitable. This method provides a specific focus on the physiological climate, which differs from other indices that may not integrate the same balance of temperature and humidity, potentially offering a more tailored assessment of human comfort in these regions.",

By calculating the temperature and humidity index, based on the formula proposed by J.E. Oliver in 1973, researchers can evaluate the climate suitability of these regions. The distribution patterns of this index and its correlation with population distribution also play a role in determining the suitability levels, which are categorized into five classes: unsuitable, critically suitable, generally suitable, relatively suitable, and highly suitable.",

This long-term data can provide insights into changes in environmental conditions and their correlation with population distributions, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of human habitation potential in different areas along the Silk Road countries.",
