The  glacial lake extent in 1964, was obtained using manual outlining methods based on geo-corrected KH-4 data; the glacial lake extent during 1976-2017, based on Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI imagery, used a semi-automatic water body classification method to distinguish between water body and non-water body information, and then extracted lake boundaries, and visually checked and manually edited by comparison with the original Landsat images.The relationship between glacial meltwater and glacial lake recharge was determined from RGI 6.0 glacier catalogues and Google Earth.",

This method involves automated processes to classify water features, followed by visual inspection and manual editing to ensure accuracy in delineating lake boundaries.",

                    "Answer": "Using semi-automated water body classification methods, based on Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI imagery, can lead to improved efficiency and consistency in identifying water bodies compared to manual digitization. However, it may also introduce errors due to the limitations of automated processes in distinguishing between water and non-water features, which necessitates visual inspection and manual editing for accuracy. The reliance on different satellite data over time might also affect consistency and precision, as each sensor has varying resolution and spectral capabilities.",

                    "Answer": "A semi-automatic water body classification method involves using Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI imagery to differentiate between water and non-water areas. This is achieved by initially applying a classification algorithm to identify water bodies and then extracting the lake boundaries. The results are visually inspected and manually edited by comparing them with the original Landsat images to ensure accuracy and precision in ice lake cataloging.",
