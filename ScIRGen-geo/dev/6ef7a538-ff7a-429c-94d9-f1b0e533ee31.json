            "description": "The integrity and authenticity of the ecosystem are the core values and management objectives of building national parks in China, among which the integrity of the ecosystem includes the structural and functional integrity of the ecosystem. This dataset selects three key service functions: water conservation, soil conservation, and wind and sand fixation as the core indicators to measure the ecosystem service functions of the Three Rivers Source National Park. Among them, water conservation reflects the comprehensive function generated by the interaction between vegetation, water, and soil, and is one of the key service functions of the terrestrial ecosystem in the Three Rivers Source Area. The precipitation storage method is used to calculate water conservation, which is measured by the hydrological regulation effect of the ecosystem; Soil conservation reflects the ability of the ecosystem to reduce soil erosion, and is one of the important regulatory functions of the ecosystem. It is calculated using the Modified General Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE); Windbreak and sand fixation reflect the ability of regional soil conservation and desertification prevention, and are one of the important service functions of ecosystems in arid and semi-arid areas. They are calculated using the modified wind erosion equation RWEQ model. This dataset calculates the indicator values before and after the pilot implementation of the Sanjiangyuan National Park system (2016) (2010-2015 and 2016-2020), standardizes them, and finally merges them into the Sanjiangyuan National Park Ecosystem Service Function Index dataset.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of ecosystem services assessment in national parks, 'water conservation capacity' refers to the comprehensive function generated by the interaction between vegetation, water, and soil. It is considered a key service function of terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in areas like Sanjiangyuan National Park. The calculation of water conservation capacity is based on the precipitation storage method, which measures the hydrological regulation effects of the ecosystem.",

                    "Answer": "The calculation of soil retention using the modified RUSLE method involves understanding the ecosystem's ability to reduce soil erosion, which requires data on factors such as rainfall, soil type, topography, and vegetation cover. Conversely, the assessment of water conservation functions using the precipitation storage method focuses on the interaction between vegetation, water, and soil to reflect hydrological regulation, requiring data on precipitation and ecosystem hydrodynamics. Both methods have their complexities: the RUSLE method requires detailed data on erosion factors, while the precipitation storage method necessitates accurate hydrological data. The accuracy of each method depends on the quality and resolution of the data collected, with potential challenges in standardizing and integrating such diverse data sources.",

Soil conservation is selected for its ability to reflect the ecosystem's capacity to reduce soil erosion, an important regulatory function, calculated using a modified version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Wind erosion control is included for its ability to reflect regional soil retention and desertification prevention, crucial in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, calculated using a modified wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model.",

                    "Answer": "The dataset employs specific methods such as the precipitation storage method for water source conservation, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) for soil retention, and the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model for wind erosion prevention. Variations in these data collection methods could significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the ecosystem service functionality indices. For example, selecting different hydrological models might change the assessment of water source conservation, potentially altering management decisions in the park. Similarly, using alternative soil erosion models could lead to different soil retention capacity outcomes, impacting how park ecosystems are perceived in terms of their role in preventing land degradation.",

Key indicators like water conservation, soil retention, and sand stabilization capture essential ecological functions, providing insights into the interaction between vegetation, water, and soil.

Water conservation is calculated using the precipitation storage method, which assesses the hydrological regulation effect of the ecosystem. Soil retention is measured through a modified version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), evaluating the ecosystem's ability to reduce soil erosion. Wind erosion prevention is assessed using a modified Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) model, reflecting the ecosystem's capacity to maintain soil and prevent desertification. These individual function values are standardized and combined to form a comprehensive ecosystem service function index.",
