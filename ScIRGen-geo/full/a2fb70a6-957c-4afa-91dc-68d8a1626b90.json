            "description": "Highly accurate spatiotemporal continuous fractional snow cover data sets are of great importance for surface water and energy balance research, climate change and disaster monitoring, etc. However, a large number of clouds cause serious data gaps in optical remote sensing of fractional snow cover. This dataset is based on the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis algorithm based on automatic endmember extraction (MESMA-AGE), which retrieves the fractional snow cover of the Terra and Aqua MODIS data and high-frequency observations from the new generation geostationary satellite FY-4A, and blend fractional snow cover retrieval results from multi-source sensors to obtain the fractional snow cover less affected by clouds. Based on the multistep spatiotemporal interpolation algorithm (MSTI), the cloud-free fractional snow cover is obtained by using the fractional snow cover information of the surrounding cloud-free pixels. The data set is the daily fractional snow cover in the Asia Water Tower region with a spatial resolution of 2 km, and the overall accuracy can reach 97.84%.",

The widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover dataset uses an eight-day composite approach to remove cloud effects, but it cannot meet the requirement of monitoring snow cover, a parameter with high temporal and spatial variability. Daily cloud-free fractional snow cover product is an important input variable in the study of surface radiation energy budget, water cycle and cryosphere.

Then, the daily multi-temporal retrieval results of FY-4A and Himawari-8 are synthesized respectively to obtain the daily results, which are used to fill the cloud obscured pixels in MODIS inversion results. Finally, the daily cloud-free fractional snow cover product is obtained by PCHIP interpolation. On this basis, the product is evaluated by using high-resolution landsat8 30m data. In this study, the visible band and 1.6μm short-wave infrared (SWIR) band are used for snow retrieval. In this paper, MODIS cloud mask data is obtained from the cloud identity of MO/YD09GA product. In this study, the MESMA algorithm is used to retrieve the FSC from the 30m surface reflectance data (visible and 1.6μm band) of Landsat8, and the results are used as the \"truth value\" to verify the accuracy of other results. Only the reflectivity data between UTC 0:00 and 10:00 is selected for FSC retrieval. In this study, the cloud mask products of both are derived from the official cloud recognition products. In this study, Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI) and visible band reflectivity data are used to extract snow and non-snow endmembers to establish typical endmembers database, and then the MESMA algorithm is used to calculate the FSC. The production process of daily cloud-free FSC is as follows: 1) Retrieval of FSC from MODIS/FY-4A/ Himawari-8 reflectivity data using MESMA algorithm; 2) The minimum zenith Angle synthesis method is used to synthesize the daily multi-temporal FSC."
