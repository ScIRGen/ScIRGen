            "description": "Global Tropical cyclone (TC) best track data already exist as individual storm tracks at other agencies. The intent of the IBTrACS project is to overcome data availability issues. This was achieved by working directly with all the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and other international centers and individuals to create a global best track dataset, merging storm information from multiple centers into one product and archiving the data for public use. The World Meteorological Organization  Tropical Cyclone Programme has endorsed IBTrACS as an official archiving and distribution resource for tropical cyclone best track data. The IBTrACS project: contains the most complete global set of historical tropical cyclones available, combines information from numerous tropical cyclone datasets, simplifies inter-agency comparisons by providing storm data from multiple sources in one place, provides data in popular formats to facilitate analysis and checks the quality of storm inventories, positions, pressures, and wind speeds, passing the information on to the user. The primary intent of IBTrACS is to support scientific research efforts.",

                "Given the significant impact of tropical cyclones (TCs) on human life, property, and ecology, it is understandable that much research has gone into understanding their distribution, frequency, and intensity around the world and how climate change might affect these parameters. Many storm characteristics help to define how an individual storm impacts life and property, such as maximum sustained wind (MSW), the distance at which various wind speeds extend outward from the storm center, rainfall patterns, minimum sea level pressure (MSLP), and storm translation speed. Despite the many facets of a storm, much of the tropical cyclone data worldwide consists of the best estimates of storm position and intensity at 6-hourly intervals only, which are termed best-track data. Optimally, best-track data are the result of postseason reanalysis of a storm’s position and intensity from all available data—for example, ship, surface, and satellite observations. However, with advances in observing system technologies, operational procedures, and scientific knowledge, the historical record of best tracks is inhomogeneous by construction. In recent decades, best-track data were used to assess the interannual and interdecadal variability of tropical cyclones and their relation to global climate change. In conjunction with other datasets, global best-track data are crucial for understanding the characteristics and impacts of tropical cyclones. Therefore, NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), in concert with the World Data Center for Meteorology—Asheville, has developed a comprehensive dataset through the collection of global tropical cyclone best-track data."
