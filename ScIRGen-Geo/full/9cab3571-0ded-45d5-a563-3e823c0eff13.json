      "description": "Near surface atmospheric forcing data were produced by using Wether Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over  the Heihe River Basin at  hourly 0.05 * 0.05 DEG resolution, including the following variables: 2m temperature, surface pressure, water vapor mixing ratio, downward shortwave & upward longwave radiation, 10m wind field and the accumulated precipitation. The forcing data were validated by observational data collected by 15 daily Chinese Meteorological Bureau conventional automatic weather station (CMA),  a few of Heihe River eco-hydrological process comprehensive remote sensing observation (WATER and HiWATER) site hourly observations were verified in different time scales, draws the following conclusion: 2m surface temperature, surface pressure and 2m relative humidity are more reliable, especially 2m surface temperature and surface pressure, the average errors are very small and the correlation coefficients are above 0.96; correlation between downward shortwave radiation and WATER site observation data is more than 0.9; The precipitation agreed well with observational data by being verified based on  rain and snow precipitation  two phases  at yearly, monthly, daily time scales . the correlation coefficient between rainfall and the observation data at monthly and yearly time scales were up to 0.94 and 0.84; the correlation between snowfall and observation data at monthly scale reached 0.78, the spatial distribution of snowfall  agreed well with the snow fractional coverage rate of MODIS remote sensing product. Verification of liquid and solid precipitation shows that WRF model can be used for downscaling analysis in complex and arid terrain of Heihe River Basin, and the simulated data can meet the requirements of watershed scale hydrological modeling and water resources balance.\nThe data for 2000-2012 was provided in 2013.\nThe data for 2013-2015 was updated in 2016.\nThe data for 2016-2018 was updated in 2019.\nThe data for 2019-2021 was updated in 2021.",

        "The near-surface atmospheric elements including air temperature, pressure, relative humility, wind, precipitation and radiation are called forcing data to drive hydrological, land surface, and ecological models. Coupling or use of the General Circulation Model (GCM) output to drive the land surface model is an important source of forcing data for large-scale land surface models, however the spatial and temporal resolution can not meet the requirements of a regional scale land surface model and its coarse resolution ignored regional environmental impact assessment. Thus, a regional scale land surface model or land surface data assimilation system needs forcing data with a higher temporal-spatial resolution. Therefore, downscaling GCM output is necessary in order to prepare for a long series of high spatial and temporal resolution forcing data for regional scale or basin-scale land surface, hydrological and ecological simulation and assimilation. Downscaling is a method of obtaining high-resolution climate or climate change information from relatively coarse-resolution GCMs. Dynamic downscaling uses large scale climatic background information to establish higher resolution meteorological distribution fields by GCMs. Regional climate model is considered to be an effective dynamic downscaling method to derive high-resolution local climate information. The model’s physical meaning is clear, it is built on the nonlinear interaction between large scale and regional scale, and can distinguish local features characterized by local topography, vegetation cover and soil hydrological processes, and can be used anywhere independent of observation data with an improved description of local features."

        "Precipitation plays an important role in meteorology, climatology, and hydrology, and is a crucial link between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. However, obtaining high resolution and reliable precipitation forcing in complex terrain, particularly mountainous regions, to drive land surface models is still a challenging work. General Circulation Models (GCMs) have the ability to treat the complex interactions of atmospheric physics and planetary-scale dynamics fairly well, but coarse horizontal resolution in GCMs restricts realistic simulation of climatic details on spatial variability. The emerging of Regional Climate Models (RCMs) as a dynamical downscaling technique has been considered to bridge the gap between regional scale estimates and the current limited resolution in GCMs. Precipitation is the most difficult variable to simulate in numerical models because of our limited understanding of precipitation phenomena, its high spatial and temporal variability, and its nonlinear nature, especially over complex terrain at small spatial scales. Precipitation is also difficult to evaluate because rain gauges are often unevenly and sparsely distributed. The microphysical process parameterization for the interactive and dynamic processes, radiation, and aerosol/chemical reactions, play a key role in cloud, climate, and weather patterns in inland regions. Sensitive analyses over the HRB are seldom and indicated that precipitation yielded better by a combination of various parameterized schemes rather than by a single parameterized scheme in the HRB. Daily precipitation simulated with the Grell cumulus convective parameterized scheme was closer to the rain gauge data than that with other schemes. However, the sensitivity of the cumulus convection parameterized scheme has little effect on the center of rainfall area and the intensity of the precipitation center over Qilian Mountain."

Furthermore, one set of physical configurations is difficult to perform well through the whole year. It is strongly recommended to use different physical schemes for simulating precipitation in summer and winter respectively. However, the resolution of TRMM 3B42V6 is 0.25°, which is considered to be too coarse to be used for hydrological analysis in the complex HRB [34]. Due to the limited amount of observation data at the hourly scale, there are few studies based on hourly precipitation events in the HRB. However, for hydrological analysis decision support systems, hourly precipitation data are urgently needed."

        "The HiWATER project provides sufficient rain gauge data to estimate the high spatio-temporal precipitation data developed by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the HRB. The HRB is the second largest inland river in China. Precipitation ranges between 550 and 50 mm from upstream to downstream, and is around 100–200 mm in the midstream, according to in situ observations. To evaluate the precipitation simulated by the WRF model, 18 rain gauges were set up to obtain the precipitation volume at 10 min intervals during the HiWATER project. Eight gauges were placed upstream, five were placed midstream, and five were placed downstream. In addition to this data, 16 conventional meteorological stations maintained by the CMA were used to evaluate WRF simulations at a daily scale."

Results are systematically validated using the in situ observations in this region and it was found that precipitation simulated by the WRF model using suitable physical configuration agrees well with the observation over the HRB at hourly, daily, monthly and yearly scales, as well as at spatial pattern. We also conclude that the dynamic downscaling using the WRF model is capable of producing high-resolution and reliable precipitation over complex mountainous areas and extremely arid environments.

        "AnswerEn": "The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model proves to be effective for downscaling meteorological data in the complex terrain of the Heihe River Basin. The model's simulations of 2-m surface temperature, surface pressure, and relative humidity are considered reliable, with high correlation coefficients. The model also effectively simulates downward shortwave radiation. However, challenges remain in simulating wind speed and rainfall accurately, indicating that while WRF is powerful, it requires careful configuration and validation to enhance precision in all meteorological parameters.",

These challenges can be addressed by deploying more rain gauges strategically across different altitudes and locations, using advanced models like the WRF with appropriate microphysical parameterizations, and employing dynamic downscaling techniques to enhance the spatial resolution and reliability of precipitation data.",
