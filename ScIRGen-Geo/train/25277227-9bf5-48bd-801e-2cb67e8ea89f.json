      "description": "Nanfeng region is a vast area with a sparse population, diverse land types and abundant natural resources. It is an important part of the natural forest region in Southwest China, and also one of the grain bases and emerging industrial bases in Tibet Autonomous Region. As it is located in the southwest border of the motherland, the mountains in the territory are high and the valleys are deep, the transportation is extremely inconvenient, the large area of natural forests have not been fully utilized, and the degree of land use is very low. In recent years, although the national economic construction and industrial and agricultural production in Nanfeng region have increased significantly, the economic foundation is still quite weak, the production technology and management level are backward, the developed and utilized land has not fully brought into play, and the per mu yield of grain crops is far lower than the national average. Moreover, soil erosion and debris flow activities have been strengthened and expanded, land resources have been damaged, biological production has been reduced, and pasture has been degraded, resulting in the deterioration of human ecological environment, which has affected social and economic development to a certain extent. Therefore, we should deeply investigate and study the land resources and the natural attributes of various types of land in the Nanfeng area, fully consider the socio-economic and technical conditions and management levels, follow the objective laws of natural environment development, propose measures and ways to rationally use and protect land resources according to local conditions, give full play to the potential of land production, In order to seek the best economic, ecological and social benefits, it is of practical significance to improve the economic outlook of the Nanfeng region and promote the development of the national economy of the Tibet Autonomous Region.\nAccording to the analysis of investigation data, the macro structure of land in Nanfeng area is obviously restricted by geomorphic factors, and geomorphic conditions control the redistribution of heat and water, resulting in regional differentiation of plant community appearance and soil physical and chemical properties, forming various land types with different production potentials. In addition, the Nanfeng area is vast and sparsely populated, and the degree of land development is extremely low. The natural attributes of most of the land have not been significantly changed by human activities. Therefore, the classification of land types in Nanfeng area should be based on landform as the dominant factor, with reference to climate characteristics and natural vegetation.\nAccording to this principle, the Nanfeng area can be divided into two land types, humid mountain type and semi humid mountain type, and 24 land types. The data includes the area, distribution range, main characteristics and main utilization direction of each land type. The original data of this data set is digitized from the book \"natural geography and natural resources of the namgyabawa peak area\".",
      "descriptionCn": "南峰地区地广人稀，土地类型多样,自然资源亦较丰富,是我国西南天然林区的重要组成部分﹐也是西藏自治区的粮食基地和新兴的工业基地之一。由于地处祖国西南边陲，境内山高谷深,交通运输极不方便,大面积天然森林尚未充分利用,土地利用程度甚低。近年来,南峰地区国民经济建设与工农业生产虽有显著增长,但经济基础仍然相当薄弱,生产技术和管理水平落后,已开发利用的土地并未充分发挥生产潜力,粮食作物亩产远低于全国平均水平。而且,水土流失、泥石流活动等已有所增强和扩展,土地资源遭受损毁,生物产量降低,牧场退化,致使人类生态环境开始恶化,在一定程度上影响社会经济的发展。因此,深入调查研究南峰地区的土地资源及各类土地的自然属性,针对当前土地利用所存在的问题,充分考虑社会经济技术条件和管理水平,遵循自然环境发展的客观规律,因地制宜提出合理利用和保护土地资源的措施和途径,充分发挥土地生产潜力,以谋求最优的经济效益﹑生态效益和社会效益﹐这对改善南峰地区的经济面貌,促进西藏自治区国民经济发展,均有实际的重要意义。\n根据考察资料分析,南峰地区土地的宏观结构明显地受地貌要素所制约,而且地貌条件控制着热量和水分的再分配,导致植物群落面貌和土壤理化性状的地域分异,形成具有不同生产潜力的各种土地类型。另外﹐南峰地区地广人稀,土地开发程度极低,绝大部分土地的自然属性尚未受人类活动影响而发生显著和改变。因此,南峰地区土地类型的划分应以地貌为主导因素,参照气候特征及天然植被状况为原则。\n据此原则,南峰地区可划分出湿润山地类和半湿润山地类两个土地类和24个土地型。数据中包含了各土地型面积、分布范围、主要特征和主要利用方向。该数据集原始数据数字化自《南迦巴瓦峰地区自然地理与自然资源》一书。",
