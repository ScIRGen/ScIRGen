            "description": "We generated a global dataset of ammonia emission factors (EFs) specific to crop management at a resolution of 5 arcmin (about 10 km) with the assistance of artificial intelligence. We used 2,775-site-year field observations of ammonia emission rates collected worldwide to develop machine learning models to predict high-resolution EFs based on various factors, such as climate, soil characteristics, crop types, irrigation water and fertilization and tillage practices. With this new EF dataset, we obtained an updated estimate of global NH3 emissions intensity from cultivated areas of rice, wheat and maize. . The EFs varied from 1.8% to 13.2% for rice, 1.3% to 11.9% for wheat and 1.3% to 14.7% for maize. ",
            "instructions": "The naming convention for data is: data content+data type+unit, such as EF-Rice_%, EF represents ammonia emission factor, Rice represents crop type, and% represents unit in%; EFI-Rice_kgNha-1yr-1, where EFI represents emission intensity, Rice represents crop type, and kgNha-1yr-1 represents the unit in kg N ha-1 yr-1. The data is stored in GeoTIFF format and can be read using software such as ArcGIS and QGIS.",

The model uses six major categories of variables as inputs: climate factors, soil properties, crop types, fertilization characteristics, irrigation amount, and tillage practices. The process involves integrating large datasets on global soil (HWSD v1.2 and ISRIC-WISE), climate (CRU v4.05), irrigation (National Tibetan Plateau Data Center), and fertilization (HaNi dataset and EarthStat dataset) to drive the model.
