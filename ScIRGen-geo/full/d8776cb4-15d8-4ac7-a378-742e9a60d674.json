            "description": "The past frozen soil map of the Tibetan Plateau was based on a small number of temperature station observations and used a classification system based on continuity. This data set used the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) to synthesize MODIS surface temperature, leaf area index, snow cover ratio and multimodel soil moisture forecast products of the National Meteorological Information Center through spatiotemporal reconstruction. In addition, precipitation observations of more than 40 meteorological stations, the precipitation products of FY2 satellite observations and the multiyear average temperature observation data of 152 meteorological stations from 2000 to 2010 were integrated to simulate the average temperature data of the Tibetan Plateau, and the permafrost thermal condition classification system was used to classify permafrost into several types: Very cold, Cold, Cool, Warm, Very warm, and Likely thawing. The map shows that, after deducting lakes and glaciers, the total area of permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau is approximately 1,071,900 square kilometers. Verification shows that this map has higher accuracy. It can provide support for future planning and design of frozen soil projects and environmental management.",

                    "Answer": "The geographically weighted regression model is a statistical technique used to account for spatial variations in data. In the context of permafrost thermal condition classification, it combines spatially and temporally reconstructed MODIS land surface temperature, leaf area index, snow cover ratio, and soil moisture forecast products from multiple models with precipitation products derived from over 40,000 meteorological stations and FY2 satellite observations, along with the many-year average temperature observations from 152 meteorological stations between 2000-2010. This model helps simulate the past 1-kilometer resolution multi-year average temperature data of the Tibetan Plateau, which is then used to classify permafrost into various thermal condition types such as Very Cold, Cold, Cool, Warm, Very Warm, and Likely Thawing.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of MODIS land surface temperature data with ground-based meteorological station observations allows for a higher resolution and more comprehensive dataset by utilizing a geographic weighted regression model. This approach incorporates spatiotemporal reconstruction and combines various remote sensing and ground-based data, resulting in a 1-kilometer resolution map with potentially higher accuracy than using only sparse meteorological station observations.",

This approach allows for a comprehensive analysis using a geographic weighted regression model, resulting in a more precise simulation of past permafrost conditions at a 1-kilometer resolution. Such integration helps in refining the classification into various thermal categories, thereby potentially providing more reliable data for planning and environmental management.",
