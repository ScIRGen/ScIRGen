            "description": "This data includes the main trace geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotope data of the whole rock. The samples were collected from four rock bodies in the West Kunlun Pamir area. The main geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, the trace elements are obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, and the Sr-Nd isotopic data of the whole rock are obtained by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Through the obtained data, the magma source areas are defined as the mixing of Mesoproterozoic ancient basement rocks and juvenile crustal materials, the mixing of meta-igneous rocks, and meta-sedimentary rocks, and Mesoproterozoic ancient basement rocks, which help understand regional magmatism and tectonic evolution.",

                    "Answer": "The need for using these advanced analytical techniques arises from the complexity and heterogeneity of granitoid rocks in the Western Kunlun region. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry is utilized to accurately determine the major elemental composition, while inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is essential for obtaining precise trace element data. Multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is critical for precise Sr-Nd isotopic analysis, which helps in understanding the magma source and mixing processes involving ancient basement rocks and new crustal materials. These methods provide detailed insights into the magmatic activities and tectonic evolution of the region.",
