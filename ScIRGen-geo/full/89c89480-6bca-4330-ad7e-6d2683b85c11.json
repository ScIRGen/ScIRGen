            "description": "As the theoretical upper bound of evapotranspiration (ET), potential ET (PET) has always taken the focus attentions from a variety of disciplines, such as climatology, ecology, hydrology and agronomy. However, substantial uncertainties exist in the current PET datasets and the popular models (e.g., various empiric models and FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model), because of unrealistic configurations of land surface and unreasonable parameterizations. Therefore, this study comprehensively considered interspecific differences various vegetation-related parameters (e.g., plant stomatal resistance and CO2 effects on stomatal resistance) to calibrate and parametrize the Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW) model for forests, shrubland, grassland and cropland, using the identified daily ET observations with no water stress (i.e., PET) at 96 eddy covariance (EC) sites across the globe. Overall, the calibrated SW model could well simulated PET in both the site-calibration and cross-validation modes.  Based on four popular meteorological datasets, relatively realistic canopy height, and time-varying land use/land cover, Leaf Area Index and gridded CO2 concentration dataset, we utilized the calibrated model to generate a global (60oS–85oN, 180oW–180oE) 5 km monthly PET, potential transpiration (PT) and potential soil evaporation (PE) dataset during 1982–2015. In short, such product has three major advantages: (1) it provides more realistic PET estimates, (2) it includes not only PET estimates but also PT and PE, and moreover (3) it can reflect impacts of elevated CO2 on PET. The new dataset provides a great opportunity for academic communities and various agencies for scientific studies (e.g., climatological analyses, hydrological modelling, and calculations of drought indices) and applications (e.g., agricultural water management).",

                    "Answer": "The uncertainties in potential evapotranspiration (PET) datasets and models are primarily due to non-realistic surface settings and unreasonable model parameterization. These issues arise from insufficient consideration of vegetation parameters, such as vegetation stomatal conductance and the effects of CO2 on stomatal conductance. To address these uncertainties, a research approach involves calibrating and parameterizing the Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW) dual-source model using PET data from 96 flux tower observations worldwide, which are not affected by water stress.",

By accounting for the physiological effects of CO2 on vegetation, the dataset may provide a more accurate representation of PET, which is crucial for global climate change research, hydrological modeling, drought index calculation, and agricultural water use estimation. This approach helps address uncertainties in traditional PET models by considering the species-specific differences in vegetation parameters.",

                    "Answer": "To calibrate a global potential evapotranspiration model accurately, it is necessary to have a dataset that includes global flux tower observations of potential evapotranspiration, which are not subject to water stress. Additionally, it requires the use of four sets of meteorological data, reprocessed global vegetation canopy height, land use/cover datasets, leaf area index data, and gridded global CO2 concentration data. These resources enable the model to consider the interspecific differences in vegetation parameters and the physiological effects of CO2 on the process of potential evapotranspiration.",
