            "description": "The data set includes the whole rock major and trace elements, Sr Nd isotopes, zircon U-Pb ages and trace elements, single mineral electron microprobe and plagioclase ar ages of the basic rocks in the ophiolite of the middle part of the Bangonghu Nujiang suture zone, Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The sampling time was 2014-2016, and the locations were the South Bank of ponco and the West Bank of Namco. The rock samples include 7 high magnesian andesites, 3 vitrinite dikes, 4 gabbros and 14 basalts on the South Bank of pengcuo. The data provide support for the study of the material composition, chronology and geochemistry of the central Tibet ocean floor plateau and the Cenozoic oceanic inner arc fragments, and are of great significance for understanding the formation and evolution of the Bangong central Tethys ocean floor plateau and the Cenozoic oceanic inner arc. The main and trace elements of the whole rock were measured by XRF and ICP-MS, respectively. The zircon U-Pb dating and trace elements were measured by la-icp-ms. the main elements of single mineral were analyzed by EPMA. The whole rock SR Nd isotope was measured by ion exchange resin separation and ICP-MS, The AR ar age of plagioclase is obtained by laser heating and isotopic analysis after the sample is irradiated by nuclear reactor, and the data are true and reliable. The testing units include State Key Laboratory of metallogenic mechanism of endogenetic metallic deposits in Nanjing University, modern analysis and testing center of Nanjing University, State Key Laboratory of continental dynamics in Northwest University, AR, u-th-he geochronology Laboratory of Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and EPMA Laboratory of School of resources and environmental engineering, Hefei University of technology. The article of the data set has been published in the well-known journal \"Gondwana research\". According to Google academic statistics, it has been cited 18 times.",

Zircon U-Pb dating and trace element testing are conducted using laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS). Single mineral major element analysis is performed with electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), while whole-rock Sr-Nd isotope testing employs ion exchange resin separation and ICP-MS. Ar-Ar dating of plagioclase is achieved by irradiating samples in a nuclear reactor followed by laser heating and isotopic analysis. These methods are carried out by research labs such as Nanjing University, Northwest University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Hefei University of Technology, ensuring the data's reliability for understanding the geological processes within the region.",
