Radiometric correction is done using the moment match method to eliminate non-uniformity, strip noise, and smile phenomenon. Radiometric calibration uses pre-flight laboratory-measured calibration coefficients, with units in W/(m^2·sr·um). Geometric coarse correction reconstructs the flight path images using POS data acquired synchronously with the images. The resulting images need further geometric fine correction using control points to align with other georeferenced data.",

Radiometric calibration utilizes calibration coefficients measured in pre-flight laboratory experiments, with units standardized to W/(m^2·sr·um).
