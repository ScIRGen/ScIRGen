            "description": "In June 2017, we found Jianzui site (36.95%) ° N,99.61 ° E; The altitude is 3350m), and 1m above the surface × According to its structural characteristics, it can be roughly divided into four layers: the first layer (0 ~ 30cm), which is the present representative soil layer, developed with modern alpine meadow soil; the second layer (0 ~ 30cm), which is composed of three layers: the first layer (0 ~ 30cm), developed with modern alpine meadow soil; The second layer (30 ~ 85CM) is gray black silty clay layer\nMixed with a large number of charcoal chips, there are pottery pieces, animal bones, stone tools and other cultural relics unearthed, of which the bones are mostly broken pieces, and some are suspected to be bone artifacts; The pottery and bones (part) have obvious traces of fire. The stone tools are made of stone tools with rough technology, and their lithology is consistent with the nearby exposed bedrock, which indicates that they are made from local materials; The third layer (85 ~ 130cm) is sandy loess with loose soil. A thin layer of light red paleosol (about 2 ~ 3cm thick) is developed at the bottom of the layer, which belongs to primary sedimentary strata and has little interference from human activities; The fourth layer (below 130cm) is bedrock without any cultural relics. In this study, the reference specimens are mainly from the laboratory of animal archaeology, scientific and technological archaeology center, Institute of archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Institute of Paleovertebrates and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Please refer to the manual of Chinese vertebrate fossils, After the identification and collection of animal bones, charcoal scraps and other cultural relics, four dating samples (a45b, a75c, a75b and a87c, respectively) were selected from the 45cm, 75cm, 75cm and 87cm layers of the profile strata, It was sent to the beta Laboratory of the United States for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C dating. The 14C dating obtained was corrected to calendar year by using the intcali13 tree ring correction curve in calibrev702",

Each layer, characterized by its distinct composition and contents, provides information about the period of deposition and human activities.

                    "Answer": "The presence of these materials across different layers suggests a pattern of human activity involving the utilization of animal resources and the use of fire, possibly for cooking or tool making, as indicated by burnt pottery and bone fragments. Different stratigraphic layers may reflect changes in cultural practices or environmental conditions, such as shifts in resource availability or technological advancements, over time.",

This methodology allows for the identification of temporal patterns in resource utilization and cultural practices, as well as the potential correlation with environmental changes documented in the stratigraphic record.",

                    "Answer": "The stone tools, characterized by their crude manufacturing and local material sourcing, suggest an adaptation to available resources and possibly a lack of advanced tool-making techniques. The pottery fragments, some of which show evidence of burning, might indicate cooking or storage practices. Together, these artifacts provide insights into the technological and subsistence strategies employed by past human populations in the region.",
