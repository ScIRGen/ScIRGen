        "The prevailing mid-latitude westerly winds, known as the Westerlies, are a fundamental component of the Earth's climate system and they play a crucial role in driving the surface ocean circulation and modulating the flux and momentum of gases, including water vapor, across land and sea, with significant impacts on the climate of its region of influence. Numerous geological studies and numerical simulations have shown that the Westerlies were responsible for the transmission of a North Atlantic climate signal to arid Central Asia, East Asia, the North Pacific Ocean, and even to northern high-latitude Greenland. Therefore, the changes in the position and intensity of the Westerlies are highly significant for the climatic evolution of mid-latitude Asia. Both geological and modeling results have shown that during intervals of low ice volume, the Westerlies circulation was strengthened, leading to the increased transport of water vapor to Central Asia and thus a moister environment. However, much less is known about the spatio-temporal climatic evolution of Central Asia during periods of high ice volume, mainly due to the lack of paleoclimate records, which hinders our understanding of the long-term evolution of the Westerlies. The millennial-scale abrupt climate oscillations during the Last Glacial were major hemispheric-scale climatic events that have attracted much attention from the paleoclimate community."

      "research objective": [
        "Accordingly, we conducted grain size analyses of high accumulation rate loess sections in Central Asia to explore the characteristics of the Westerlies during H2, when the global ice volume was high. Our results provide significant information about the spatio-temporal pattern of the Westerlies in Central Asia and the paleoclimatic history of mid-latitude Asia."

      "challenges": [
        "It was difficult to obtain the original grain size frequency distribution data for the other loess sections, and therefore EM analysis could not be conducted for these sections."

      "methods": [
        "Therefore, we remeasured the grain-size distributions of the Hoalin section to verify the reliability of the data, following the procedures of Lu and An (1998), as follows. All samples were pretreated to remove organic matter and calcium carbonate by heating to 100 °C in 10% H2O2 and then with 10% HCL on a furnace at 180 °C, respectively, until the reactions were complete. Then, 10 mL of 0.05 mol/L (NaPO3)6 were added and the samples were ultrasonicated for 5 min aid dispersion. Grain size distributions were measured using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser grain size analyzer, with the measurement range of 0.02 – 2000 μm. Geochemical analysis was conducted on 5 g powder samples at 2-cm intervals, using a Netherlands PW2403 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer at the operating temperature of 20 ± 0.05 °C. All analyses were conducted at the Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University, China."

The thickness of the section is ~4 m, and it consists of homogeneous windblown silt. In a previous study, 9 OSL samples were collected from the Hoalin section to provide a geochronology, and the results showed that the loess mainly accumulated from the LGM onwards. In addition, to provide a spatio-temporal record of loess characteristics, we also investigated several loess sections from south to north on the western slopes of the Tienshan Mountains and Pamirs Plateau. These sections include the DK section in the Tajik Basin, the Osh section in the Fergana Basin, the ZKT and TLD sections in the Yili Basin, and the TC section in the Tacheng Basin."

      "findings": [
        "During Heinrich event 2 (H2), the Westerlies strengthened in southern Central Asia, as indicated by the high accumulation rate of dust transported by the Westerlies, while it decreased in northern Central Asia. Our grain size record, combined with climate modeling results, suggest that the main axis of the Westerlies strengthened and moved southward to southern Central Asia during Heinrich events, especially H2. Comparison with other climate records from East Asia indicates that a southward shift of the Westerlies may influence the extension of the downstream East Asian Summer monsoon rain belt into north and northwest China."
