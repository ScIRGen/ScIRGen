            "description": "This dataset contains multiple isotopes (i.e., H, O, C, Sr) of river water from the north and east of the Qilian Mountains and loess profile in Huanxian in the southeastern Tibetan Platea. 52 river water samples were collected from the north and east of the Qilian Mountains. 141 powder samples were collected from different depths of the loess profile in Huanxian, Gansu Province. The sampling interval is 5 cm, including the lower part of the L1 layer, the entire S1 layer and the upper part of the L2 layer, corresponding to MIS 4~MIS 6 stage. The temperature, pH, conductivity (Ec) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the water sample were measured by a water quality parameter detector on-site during sampling. The samples were filtered within 24 hours after collection and stored at room temperature. Microcodium was picked out from >75μm fractions using a binoscope, then dissolved in 0.075N HNO3 for a test of Mg, Ca, Sr and 87Sr/86Sr. The related experiments were carried out at Tianjin University and Nanjing University with detailed information in the data documents. This dataset provides significant materials for finding out the various mechanisms of all kinds of isotopes and elements in the surficial processes, and quantifying the status of modern weathering and denudation with different lithologies in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau.",
            "instructions": "The data files are stored in tabular format and named \" Dataset of H and O isotope of modern processes in the northern and eastern basins of the Qilian Mountain\", “Dataset of stable C isotope of modern processes in the northern and eastern basins of the Qilian Mountain” and “A dataset of strontium isotopes of microcodium on the Chinese Loess Plateau”. They were stored as .xlsx files and can be opened and read by the Excel program directly. ",

                    "Answer": "The process involves collecting river water samples from the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, specifically from the Qilian Mountains, and gathering powdered samples at various depths from a loess profile in Huan County, Gansu Province. River water samples are measured for temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (Ec), and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) on-site using a water quality parameter detector. After collection, samples are filtered, sealed, and stored at room temperature within 24 hours. For loess profile samples, micro-calcite bodies are extracted using a binocular microscope from samples larger than 75μm particle size, dissolved in 0.075N HNO3, and analyzed for Mg, Ca, Sr content, and 87Sr/86Sr. These procedures are carried out in laboratories at Tianjin University and Nanjing University, providing crucial data for understanding isotopic and elemental changes in the surface processes of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and weathering and erosion characteristics in its surrounding regions.",

The isotopic data can help infer processes like chemical weathering, precipitation contributions, and element cycling in the region's unique geological and climatic context. The methodology of collecting and analyzing these isotopes supports a detailed understanding of the surface processes affecting the plateau over time.",
