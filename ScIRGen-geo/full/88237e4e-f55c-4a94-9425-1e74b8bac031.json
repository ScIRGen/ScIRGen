There are three files in total, namely file 1, text version of grassland Degradation classification on The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, file type is Word, and file 2, named As Map, with seven maps in total. The type of the image is PNG, and the name of the image is the trend rate of average NDVI change in the growing season of grass, grassland, meadow, grassland, alpine vegetation, desert and swamp on the Tibetan Plateau from 2010 to 2019. File 3. The folder named as data is filled with pictures. There are 7 kinds of pictures with the same names as above.",

This method includes compiling images in various formats such as hdr, tif, xml, ovr, and png, which help in analyzing growth season average NDVI change trend rates for different vegetation types like grass clusters, grasslands, meadows, steppes, alpine vegetation, deserts, and swamps.",

                    "Answer": "The observed patterns in NDVI change trends over the Tibetan Plateau from 2010 to 2019 can suggest various environmental factors such as climate variation, human activities, and ecological processes affecting vegetation growth. Changes in NDVI might indicate shifts in seasonal weather patterns, grazing pressures, or land use changes. The degradation levels of the grassland could be related to alterations in precipitation, temperature, or the impact of human activities such as agriculture or urbanization.",
