      "description": "Supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science (XDA19070100). Tao Che, the director of this program, who comes from Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing of Gansu Province, Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, CAS. They used machine learning methods combined with multi-source gridded snow depth product data to derive a long-time series over the Northern Hemisphere.\nFirstly, the applicability of artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) method in snow depth fusion are compared. It is found that random forest method shows strong advantages in snow depth data fusion. Secondly, using the random forest method, combined with remote sensing snow depth products such as AMSR-E, AMSR-2, NHSD and GlobSnow and reanalysis data such as ERA-Interim and MERRA-2. These gridded snow depth products and environmental factor variables are used as the input independent variables of the model. In situ observations of China Meteorological Station (945), Russia Meteorological Station (620), Russian snow survey data (514), and global historical meteorological network (41261) are used as reference truth to train and verify the model. The daily gridded snow depth dataset of the snow hydrological year from 1980 to 2019 (September 1 of the previous year to May 31 of the current year) is prepared on the cloud platform provided by the CASEarth. Since the passive microwave brightness temperature data from 1980 to 1987 is the data of every other day, there will be a small number of missing trips in the data during this period. Using the ESM-SnowMIP and independent ground observation data for verification, the quality of the fusion data set has been improved. According to the comparison between the ground observation data and the snow depth products before fusion, the determination coefficient (R2) of the fusion data is increased from 0.23 (GlobSnow snow depth product) to 0.81, and the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are also reduced to 7.7 cm and 2.7 cm.",

        "Seasonal snow is a fundamental component of the global energy and water cycles (Barnett et al., 2005; Bormann et al., 2018). Snowpack is highly vulnerable to climate change, but although snow extent is monitored routinely, the fundamental properties of snow depth is measured remarkably poorly (Pritchard., 2021). The IPCC Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) highlighted key strengths and weaknesses in our understanding of the cryosphere and mass and spatial-temporal variability trends in snow depth over the Northern Hemisphere during the 20th century that have still not been accurately assessed (IPCC, 2019). In contrast to snow cover, reliable quantitative knowledge on snow depth and its trend is lacking (Bormann et al., 2018; Pulliainen et al., 2020). Snow depth is more challenging to monitor than snow cover extent at both global (Zhu et al., 2021) and regional scales because of limited surface observations along with inadequate measurements and methods for retrieval from space (Bormann et al., 2018). Hence, confidence in snow depth trends is much lower than that of snow cover extent. Currently, snow depth data can be obtained from manual observations, passive microwave brightness temperature, synthetic aperture radars (Lievens et al., 2019), and reanalysis datasets. In situ observations consist of meteorological station data, snow survey data and automatic snow depth observation equipment set up in the field. These datasets, while accurate, are based on single-point observation. Snow surveys are time-consuming and laborious. Some automatic measurement networks provide snow depth information, but are mostly located in nearly flat terrains and seldom cover the highest elevations (Dozier et al., 2016). Snow depth data retrieved based on passive microwave brightness can reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of large areas. Hereafter, these datasets are referred to as remote sensing snow depth products. At present, frequently used remote sensing snow depth products are from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2), which succeeded AMSR-E, a long time series of the Northern Hemisphere snow depth (NHSD) and the Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow). The accuracy of AMSR-E and AMSR-2 is higher in North America than in Eurasia (Xiao et al., 2020). The accuracy of the NHSD snow depth product is high in China but low in Europe, America and Canada, where snow tends to be deep (Hu et al., 2021). GlobSnow incorporated some ground observations and has been recognized as the most accurate remote sensing."

The original spatial resolution of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset was 0.5° × 0.625°, which was subsequently resampled to 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution by nearest interpolation. This ensured that the original gridded snow depth products used in this study had the same spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and daily temporal resolution from 1980 to 2019. In this study, the time series of these in situ observations were obtained from 1980 to 2019."

The fused snow depth had a decreasing trend based on the spatiotemporal analysis and Mann-Kendall trend test method.

        "季节性雪是全球能量和水循环的一个基本组成部分（Barnett et al., 2005; Bormann et al., 2018）。雪盖对气候变化高度脆弱，但尽管雪的覆盖范围被定期监测，雪深的基本特性却测量得相当不足（Pritchard., 2021）。气候变化中的海洋和冰冻圈特别报告（IPCC SROCC）强调了我们对冰冻圈的理解中的关键优势和劣势，以及20世纪北半球雪深的质量和时空变异趋势，这些仍未得到准确评估（IPCC, 2019）。与雪覆盖相比，关于雪深及其趋势的可靠定量知识仍然缺乏（Bormann et al., 2018; Pulliainen et al., 2020）。在全球（Zhu et al., 2021）和区域尺度上，监测雪深比监测雪覆盖范围更具挑战性，因为表面观测有限，且从太空获取的测量和方法不足（Bormann et al., 2018）。因此，雪深趋势的信心远低于雪覆盖范围。目前，雪深数据可以通过人工观测、被动微波亮温、合成孔径雷达（Lievens et al., 2019）和再分析数据集获得。现场观测包括气象站数据、雪调查数据和在现场设置的自动雪深观测设备。这些数据集虽然准确，但基于单点观测。雪调查耗时且劳动强度大。一些自动测量网络提供雪深信息，但大多位于几乎平坦的地形，且很少覆盖最高海拔地区（Dozier et al., 2016）。基于被动微波亮温获取的雪深数据可以揭示大面积的时空模式。此后，这些数据集被称为遥感雪深产品。目前，常用的遥感雪深产品来自地球观测系统的先进微波扫描辐射计（AMSR-E）、继承AMSR-E的先进微波扫描辐射计-2（AMSR-2）、北半球雪深的长期系列（NHSD）和全球气候研究的雪监测（GlobSnow）。AMSR-E和AMSR-2在北美的准确性高于欧亚大陆（Xiao et al., 2020）。NHSD雪深产品在中国的准确性高，但在欧洲、美国和加拿大的准确性较低，这些地区的雪往往较深（Hu et al., 2021）。GlobSnow结合了一些地面观测，被认为是最准确的遥感产品。"
