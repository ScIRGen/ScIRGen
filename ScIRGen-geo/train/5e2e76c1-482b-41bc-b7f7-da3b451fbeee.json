                "Over the past decades, human-induced climate change has led to a widespread wetting and warming of the Tibetan Plateau, affecting both ecosystems and the carbon cycling therein. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is characterized by strong diurnal and seasonal gradients of radiation, temperature, and moisture availability. Similar to the northern high latitudes, the TP is warming considerably faster than the global average. Since 1970 the air temperature has increased with roughly 0.35 °C per decade (Yao et al., 2019). The rising temperatures have profound influences on the hydrological cycle: Melting glaciers, degradation of permafrost, increasing river discharge, and rising lake levels are among the most prominent effects of global warming. Nearly half of the plateau’s surface is covered with the biggest pastoralist system in the world, comprised of 450,000 km2 of Kobresia pygmaea (syn. Carex parvula) pastures and about 800,000 km2 of alpine steppe ecosystems (Miehe et al., 2011, 2019). The Tibetan grasslands not only provide the livelihood for the (semi-) nomadic Tibetan herders to raise their livestock, they also store up to 3.3 % soil organic carbon, thus being part of the global carbon cycle (Zhou et al., 2019). The TP experiences increasing precipitation throughout most regions and times of the year (X. Wang et al., 2018). The majority of the observed warming trend, at about twice the mean annual trend, occurs during the winter months (Yao et al., 2019). The earlier onset of summer monsoon precipitation was found to play a major role in the increasing the size of lake areas of the endorheic inner TP (Liu et al., 2019), as well as in increasing soil moisture and a widespread greening of the ecosystems during early summer (W. Zhang et al., 2017)."

                "The aim of this study is to disentangle the complex interplay of climatic variations and the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CO2, from daily to monthly and annual to inter-annual time spans. The analyses of long term carbon fluxes, associated meteorological observations and plant cover estimates from a central Tibetan alpine steppe ecosystem allow the investigation of the following research questions: Can the general trend of increasing temperatures and precipitation also be observed in the alpine steppe ecosystem at Nam Co? Is the alpine steppe ecosystem a net sink or a net source of carbon dioxide during recent years? How is the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CO2 characterized on daily to monthly and annual to inter-annual time scales? Do the observed changes in environmental variables promote or hamper plant productivity and soil respiration in the long run?"

                "It remains uncertain if the Tibetan alpine steppe ecosystem is currently a net sink or a net source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and in which way the observed climate changes influence the carbon cycling. The difficult accessibility and harsh environmental conditions provide a challenging environment for conducting (micro-) meteorological measurements. Hence, most studies draw their conclusions only from observations during the growing seasons of a few years at most."

                "Here we present long term observations of carbon fluxes, meteorological variables and remotely sensed plant cover estimations from a central Tibetan alpine steppe ecosystem at Nam Co, the third largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau. Using modified Mann-Kendall trend tests, we found a significant increasing daily net carbon uptake of 0.5 g C m-2 decade-1, which can be explained by a widespread greening at the southern shore of lake Nam Co. The study site is located at the Nam Co Station for Multi-sphere Observation and Research (NAMORS, Chinese Academy of Sciences), about 220 km north of the Tibetan capital Lhasa (30° 46’ N, 90° 57’ E). In 2005, the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research (ITP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) installed (micro-)meteorological measurements at the NAMORS (Y. Ma et al., 2009). A 3 m Eddy Covariance tower measures the 3D wind vector with a CSAT3 ultrasonic anemometer and the carbon and water vapor fluxes using a Li-7500 open path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA). The LUT gap filling procedure relies heavily on the availability of meteorological measurements (mainly air temperature, radiation and vapor pressure deficit). The measured CO2 fluxes represent the Net Ecosystem CO2 Exchange (NEE), which we partitioned into its components gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), representing the photosynthetic uptake of CO2 and the autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration, respectively."

The total NEE data availability is 54.5 %, excluding the year 2013 for which close to no data are available. While four years have data availability > 75 % (2007 - 2009, 2017), there are also four years with data availability < 30 % (2012 - 2014, 2019). After discarding unreliable fluxes, outliers and fluxes originating from disturbed areas, overall NEE data availability dropped to 33.7 %. Filling of data gaps spanning up to 60 continuous days increased the total data availability to 75.7 % with seven complete years."

While these changes differ over the course of the year, they tend to stimulate plant growth more than microbial respiration, leading to an increased carbon uptake during all seasons. This study indicates that during the 14 years study period, a higher amplitude in winter temperatures and an earlier summer monsoon promote carbon uptake in a central Tibetan alpine steppe ecosystem."

                "Plant coverage is a basic indicator of the biomass production in ecosystems. On the Tibetan Plateau, the biomass of grasslands provides major ecosystem services with regard to the predominant transhumance economy. The pastures, however, are threatened by progressive degradation, resulting in a substantial reduction in plant coverage with currently unknown consequences for the hydrological/climate regulation function of the plateau and the major river systems of SE Asia that depend on it and provide water for the adjacent lowlands. Plant coverage is a key proxy used to estimate and monitor important ecosystem parameters and functions by remote sensing, particularly for such expanses as the grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. The Tibetan Plateau hosts the world's largest high-mountain grassland ecosystem, and it significantly influences the hydrology of East and South-East Asia. Despite their great importance, the pastures of the plateau are threatened by environmental change. To date, there is strong evidence that degradation of the grassland due to climate change and overgrazing may alter the phenology of the vegetation, thus adversely affecting ecosystem stability on the plateau. Because of the enormous spatial extent and remoteness of the Tibetan pastures, it is obvious that remote sensing is the only tool for assessing and monitoring the plateau's plant coverage."

These methods are applied at different spatial resolutions and use RGB and hyperspectral field surveys as references. The challenge of low vegetation cover, particularly in arid environments, is addressed by selecting methods that minimize the influence of the soil background signal, with support vector machine regressions showing the best accuracy in these conditions.",
