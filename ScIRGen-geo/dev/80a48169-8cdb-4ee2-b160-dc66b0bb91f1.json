            "description": "The data are zircon U-Pb isotopic dating data and zircon Lu Hf isotopic dating data of quartz diorite porphyrite in Guichi ore concentration area in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The data is true and reliable. Through the data obtained, we can (1) describe and summarize the geological characteristics, magmatic metallogenic age, petrochemistry, deposit geochemistry and fluid characteristics of typical deposits in Guichi area, and summarize the metallogenic model of Guichi area（ 2) Understand the tectonic background of Guichi area and establish the chronological framework of Guichi area（ 3) The relationship between mineralization and late Jurassic Early Cretaceous tectonothermal events is discussed.",

Zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu-Hf isotope composition should be determined using laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). This approach enables the characterization of geological features, magmatic mineralization ages, petrology, and geochemistry to summarize metallogenic models, understand tectonic backgrounds, and explore the relationship with Jurassic-Cretaceous tectonothermal events.",
