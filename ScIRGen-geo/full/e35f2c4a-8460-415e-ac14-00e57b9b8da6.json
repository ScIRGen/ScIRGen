            "description": "This data is the whole rock major and trace zircon U-Pb isotopic dating data, zircon Lu Hf isotopic data and apatite major data of the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous intrusive rocks in the South Anhui gold (antimony) deposit. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The main data of apatite were obtained by EPMA analysis, and the micro data were obtained by LA-ICP-MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the data obtained, the genetic model of magmatism related gold deposits in southern Anhui can be proposed to guide the future prospecting work.",
