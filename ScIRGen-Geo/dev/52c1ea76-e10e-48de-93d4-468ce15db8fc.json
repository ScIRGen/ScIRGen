      "description": "Based on long-term series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products, daily snow cover products without data gaps at 500 m spatial resolution over the Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2022 were generated by employing a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) modeling technique. This HMRF framework optimally integrates spectral, spatiotemporal, and environmental information together, which not only fills data gaps caused by frequent clouds, but also improves the accuracy of the original MODIS snow cover products. In particular, this technology incorporates solar radiation as an environmental contextual information to improve the accuracy of snow identification in mountainous areas. Validation with in situ observations and snow cover derived from Landsat-8 OLI images revealed that these new snow cover products achieved an accuracy of 98.29% and 91.36%, respectively. Specifically, the accuracy of the new snow products is higher during the snow transition period and in complex terrains with higher elevations as well as sunny slopes. These gap-free snow cover products effectively improve the spatiotemporal continuity and the low accuracy in complex terrains of the original MODIS snow products, and is thus the basis for the study of climate change and hydrological cycling in the TP.",

        "Snow cover has the characteristics of low thermal diffusivity, high reflectivity, and strong water storage capacity, which has a profound effect on climate change, radiation budget, hydrological cycle, and human activities. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has abundant snow cover, with the highest elevation and largest snow cover area in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Snow is highly sensitive to climate change, and snowmelt water quantity is closely connected to the supply of soil moisture on the plateau and the runoff of numerous rivers such as the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Long-term and detailed snow cover information is fundamental to investigating climate change and the hydrological cycle of the TP. Remote sensing has allowed extraction of historical and near-real-time snow cover extent over inaccessible areas. Although these satellites have a high spatial resolution, they have a relatively coarse (10 or 16 d) temporal resolution, thereby rendering them insufficient to monitor the temporal variations in snow cover. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has commenced producing snow products at 500 m resolution from 2000, which have been widely utilized as the primary datasets for monitoring snow cover. The accuracy of MODIS snow products is greater than 85 % at the global scale under clear sky. However, these products have many data gaps due to frequent clouds, causing discontinuity in the time and space of the products. In addition, the complex terrain of the TP makes it more challenging for accurate snow cover detection. Previous studies have suggested the low accuracy of MODIS snow products for mountainous areas."

        "Seasonal snow cover and its melt play an important role in regional energy balance, hydrological circulation, and climate variability. More than one-sixth of Earth's population depends on seasonal snow and snow-covered glaciers as the main source of water supplies, and one-fourth of the world's Global Domestic Product (GDP) is generated from snow dominated mountainous areas. In the western United States, snowmelt contributes 70% of total annual runoff in mountainous areas. Recent analyses of historical weather records and climate modeling with and without anthropogenic forcings have clearly shown that anthropogenic warming has increased the drought intensity in California. Warming trends have produced a shift toward more precipitation falling as rain than snow. Spring snowpack has declined at roughly 75% of sites, with the largest declining snowpack in the lower elevations in the western United States. Snow cover extent is a critical snowpack attribute for forecasting operational snowmelt runoff, reconstructing spatial distributions of snow water equivalent, calibrating or validating various hydrological models, and monitoring regional climate change. Traditionally, snow cover mapping is mainly based on the interpolation of snow depth or snow water equivalent measurements from in situ sensors and stations. However, due to their sparse spatial distribution or even absence in remote and inaccessible regions, in situ ground observation networks cannot provide adequate and accurate information of snow cover over wide geographic areas. Satellite remote sensing technology has proven an effective and reliable alternative to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of snow cover at the regional and hemispheric/global scales. Most notably, daily or 8-day composites of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products at a spatial resolution of 500 m have been archived and distributed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) since 2000, which have been widely used for regional hydrological modeling. Under clear-sky condition, the MODIS daily snow cover products have an overall accuracy better than 80%. However, the snow product accuracy is significantly lower for forested areas and topographically complex regions and for the time periods when snow cover is thin and ephemeral. As an optical sensor, MODIS observations are also severely affected by frequent cloud cover, resulting in data gaps, particularly for daily snow products."
