            "description": "These data contain two data files: GLOBELAND30 TILES (raw data) and TIBET_ GLOBELAND30_MOSAIC (mosaic data).\nThe raw data were downloaded from the Global Land Cover Data website (GlobalLand3) (http://www.globallandcover.com) and cover the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas. The raw data were stored in frames, and for the convenience of using the data, we use Erdas software to splice and mosaic the raw data.\nThe Global Land Cover Data (GlobalLand30) is the result of the “Global Land Cover Remote Sensing Mapping and Key Technology Research”, which is a key project of the National 863 Program. Using the American Landsat images (TM5, ETM+) and Chinese Environmental Disaster Reduction Satellite images (HJ-1), the data were extracted by a comprehensive method based on pixel classification-object extraction-knowledge checks. The data include 10 primary land cover types—cultivated land, forest, grassland, shrub, wetland, water body, tundra, man-made cover, bare land, glacier and permanent snow—without extracting secondary types. In terms of accuracy assessment, nine types and more than 150,000 test samples were evaluated. The overall accuracy of the GlobeLand30-2010 data is 80.33%. The Kappa indicator is 0.75.\nThe GlobeLand30 data use the WGS84 coordinate system, UTM projection, and 6-degree banding, and the reference ellipsoid is the WGS 84 ellipsoid. According to different latitudes, the data are organized into two types of framing. In the regions of 60° north and south latitudes, the framing is carried out according to a size of 5° (latitude) × 6° (longitude); in the regions of 60° to 80° north and south latitudes, the framing is carried out according to a size of 5° (latitude) × 12° (longitude). The framing is projected according to the central meridian of the odd 6° band.\nGLOBELAND30 TILES: The original, unprocessed raw data are retained.\nTIBET_ GLOBELAND30_MOSAIC: The Erdas software is used to mosaic the raw data. The parameter settings use the default value of the raw data to retain the original, and the accuracy is consistent with that of the downloading site.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of extracting land cover data, 'pixel classification-object extraction-knowledge verification' refers to a comprehensive method used to derive land cover types from satellite imagery. Pixel classification involves categorizing individual pixels based on their spectral characteristics, object extraction identifies and delineates distinct features or areas from the classified pixels, and knowledge verification applies expert knowledge or rules to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the extracted information.",

                    "Answer": "The classification of surface cover types on the Tibetan Plateau using satellite imagery like TM5, ETM+, and HJ-1 can be challenging due to the diverse and complex landscape of the region, which includes a variety of surface types such as cropland, forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, water, tundra, artificial cover, bare land, glacier, and permanent snow. The method employed, which is pixel classification-object extraction-knowledge verification, must account for these varied terrains. Additionally, factors such as the resolution of the imagery, the temporal coverage, and the inherent limitations of remote sensing technologies can also impact classification accuracy. The overall accuracy of the GlobeLand30-2010 dataset was evaluated to be 80.33%, with a Kappa index of 0.75, indicating reasonable but not perfect accuracy, suggesting room for improvement possibly due to these challenges.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objectives include achieving accurate land cover classification by leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery, which allows for detailed mapping of diverse and complex terrains. The comprehensive method of pixel classification, object extraction, and knowledge verification aims to efficiently identify and categorize various land cover types such as cropland, forest, grassland, and others.
