However, the traditional fully convolution network still has problems in recovering spatial details and discriminating buildings with varying sizes and styles. Precise building footprint data is essential to the researches of the urban environment, energy consumption, urban planning, urban function, building change detection, and urban morphology. Remote sensing data have become the primary sources for building footprint extraction. Due to the diversity of buildings’ type and scale, it is still challenging to extract buildings accurately from remote sensing imagery. Early studies of building extraction relied on the fusion of LIDAR points and multispectral imagery. More recent studies, however, aim at extracting building footprints directly from high-resolution imagery. The methods mentioned above consistently require image transformation to obtain the complex features of building objects. However, the effectiveness of using these features varies substantially from one case to another because of the varying sensors, building types, and ground conditions."
