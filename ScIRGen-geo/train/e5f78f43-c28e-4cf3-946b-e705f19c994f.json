            "description": "The data includes continuous and discontinuous permafrost and seasonally frozen ground distributed in the Qilian Mountains. Based on the field investigation, borehole drillings along the highway as well as previous data collected from the documentations, the lower limits of permafrost and the formula of the lower limits of permafrost in the Qilian Mountains is obtained by regression analysis. The digital elevation model (DEM) data is the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) jointly measured by NASA and NIMA. After the data being transformed into GCS WGS 1984 coordinate system, it is resampled into 100 m spatial resolution. The altitude of 3000 m was used to define the area of the Qilian Mountains. With the aid of ArcGIS platform and the support of DEM data, the permafrost distribution map of the Qilian Mountains with a resolution of 100 m is simulated. The lower limits of permafrost obtained by the regression analysis passed the significance test. According to the 548 existing borehole data points, the verification accuracy of permafrost area is 90.11%. The data can be used to estimate the ground ice content and the amount of water released from permafrost degradation.",

The defined geographic scope is set at an altitude of 3,000 m to delineate the Qilian Mountain area. This process is supported by ArcGIS platform simulations, which produce a 100 m resolution permafrost distribution map. A regression model for the permafrost distribution lower boundary is derived and validated through significance testing. The accuracy of this model is verified using 548 borehole data points, achieving a permafrost area validation accuracy rate of 90.11%.",

This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of permafrost boundaries and characteristics, which can be validated and adjusted based on real-world measurements, such as the 548 borehole data points with a validation accuracy of 90.11%. The integration of DEM data at a 100 m spatial resolution further refines the spatial representation of permafrost, aiding in accurate simulations and potentially improving the models' applicability for estimating underground ice content and assessing permafrost degradation impacts on water release. This multifaceted data collection approach can also support ecological restoration and environmental management efforts by providing reliable data for decision-making.",
