            "description": "Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the important parameters between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. LST is not only a sensitive indicator for measuring climate change factors and an important prerequisite for grasping climate change patterns, but also a direct input parameter for many models, and has a wide range of applications in many fields such as meteorology, environmental ecology, hydrology, and climate. With the deepening of research and refinement of related studies, there is an urgent need for all - weather LST based on satellite remote sensing. The dataset was generated based on enhanced Reanalysis and Thermal infrared remote sensing Merging (E-RTM) method. The primary input data for the method are Terra/Aqua MODIS LST products and GLDAS data, with ancillary data including NDVI and surface albedo. The evaluation results show that the dataset not only has good image quality and seamless spatial accuracy, but also has a high degree of agreement in amplitude and spatial distribution with the 1 km Terra/Aqua MODIS LST product, which is now widely used in academia day by day. The mean bias deviation (MBD) of the data set is 0.09 K and 0.03 K and the standard deviation of bias (STD) is 1.45 K and 1.17 K for daytime and nighttime when using MODIS LST as a reference. There is no significant difference between sky and clear sky conditions. The temporal resolution of this dataset is four observations per day, the spatial resolution is 1 km, and the time span is 2000-2022; the spatial scope includes the main land areas of China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, excluding the South China Sea islands for the time being), and the surrounding areas (72°E-135°E, 19°N-55°N). The abbreviation of this dataset is TRIMS LST (Thermal and Reanalysis Integrating Moderate-resolution Spatial-Seamless LST. In order to reduce the related user data download and processing effort, the TRIMS LST - TP (Daily 1-km all-weather land surface temperature dataset for Western China (TRIMS LST-TP; 2000-2022) V2) synchronous National Tibetan Plateau Data Center.",
            "instructions": "File naming: LST data are in GEOTIFF and NETCDF formats, each file is about 35MB, and the data of different years are stored in folders named \"year\", which are stored in two folders, one for daytime and the other for nighttime. The specific file naming method is \"TRIMS_Aqua/TRIMS_Terra+year+DOY+D/N.tif\", in which DOY stands for Day of the Year, D/N stands for Day/Night, such as TRIMS_Aqua2020001D.tif.\nData format: Integer\nUsage: It can be read and subsequently processed directly by GIS software or matlab, etc. The image value/100=surface temperature value (two decimal places are retained);\nData resolution: 4 times per day, 1 km.\nData time: corresponds to the instantaneous transit time of MODIS pixels, see the data description document for details of the processing.\nKey parameters of the dataset:\n(1) Projection mode: Albers equal area\n(2) Missing values: Uniformly labelled with 0.",
