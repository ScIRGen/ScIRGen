Earth System Models (ESMs) are the key tools for predicting the response of SM to future climate change. Many ESMs provide outputs for SM; however, the estimated SM accuracy from different ESMs varies geographically as each ESM has its advantages and limitations. In recent years, ESMs that considered dynamic, physical, chemical, and biological processes are the key tools for predicting the response of SSM to future climate change. The processes in the earth system are difficult to understand mainly because of their complexity. The traditional fusion method is the ensemble mean, considered a simple and effective data merging technique. Another important issue is that the spatial resolutions of ESMs products are generally low and un-matched."

The novelty of this study is that our final output data is downscaled data with the high resolution 0.25° × 0.25°, and merged data that retains the advantages of different ESMs. Therefore, this study uses historical CMIP6 SSM data to train a DL model with fusion and downscaling functions and obtains high-resolution SSM merged data (CMIP6DL)."

The traditional fusion method is easily affected by extreme values which obscure the differences in data so that the simulation advantages of some models in various regions are erased."

By applying this relationship in the future period, a merged SSM product, which conforms to the characteristics of the ERA5-Land dataset distribution, is developed with improved accuracy and spatial resolution in China for 2015-2100 through data fusion of 25 ESMs. We use the re-gridded 25 ESMs data as input XESM; thus, the input has 25 channels for SSM data. We divide all historical data into three datasets: the training dataset (1950-1999), the validation dataset (2000-2007) and the testing dataset (2008-2014). In training the model, we add a land-ocean mask to focus only on the land SSM. We match the 25 ESMs SSM data and the reference data simultaneously as a group and put the groups into the model for training. We apply 100 epochs in the training phase. We use the Dropout method during training."

Due to improved computing performance in recent years, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has produced more detailed global datasets than ever before. The most advanced dataset is the ERA5-Land dataset, and the ERA5-Land performed strongly in a SM intercomparison of 18 products with many (826) in situ stations. This study uses a monthly SSM dataset with a high horizontal resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° from 1950 to 2014."

By further analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of SM with the merged product in China, we found that northeast China will become wetter whereas South China will become drier. Northwest China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau would change from wetting to drying under a medium emission scenario. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedure for simultaneous data fusion and spatial downscaling to generate improved SM data."
