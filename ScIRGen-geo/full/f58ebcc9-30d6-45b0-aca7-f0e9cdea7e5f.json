            "description": "The data are the radioisotope geochronology data of ore-forming porphyry, the main trace and isotopic data of whole rock, and the mineral trace and isotopic data. The samples were collected from the metallogenic granite porphyry of yuanzhuding porphyry Cu Mo deposit in qinhang belt. Radioisotope geochronology data were obtained from zircon U-Pb isotope analysis by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and molybdenite Re Os isotope analysis by hot electron inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively, The whole rock SR Nd isotope and zircon Hf isotope were obtained by multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the mineral trace was obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The obtained data, combined with the data of other porphyry deposits in the Qinhang belt, can limit the characteristics of magma source area, thus revealing that in the thick \"inland\" crust, different degrees of crust mantle material participation can form different metallogenic types.",
            "instructions": "All data are stored in Excel file. The file name of \"supplement Table 1\" represents zircon U-Pb age data of yuanzhuding porphyry, \"supplement Table 2\" represents Re Os isotope data of Molybdenite of yuanzhuding porphyry, \"supplement Table 3\" represents zircon micro data of yuanzhuding porphyry, and \"supplement Table 4\" represents major and micro data of yuanzhuding porphyry, The file name \"supplementary table 5\" represents SR Nd isotopic data of yuanzhuding porphyry, and the file name \"supplementary table 6\" represents Hf isotopic data of zircon of yuanzhuding porphyry.",
