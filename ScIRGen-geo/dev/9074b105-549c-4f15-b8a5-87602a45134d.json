            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the A’rou superstation eddy covariance system (EC) in the upperstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2018. The site (100.372° E, 38.856° N) was located in the Daban Village, near Qilian County in Qinghai Province. The elevation is 3033 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3.5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500A) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. Data during insufficient power supply, data were missing occasionally.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                    "Answer": "The Eddy Covariance method is a technique used to measure and analyze the exchange of gases, such as CO2 and water vapor, between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. In the context of a mountainous meadow environment, this method involves the use of instruments like an ultrasonic anemometer (CSAT3) and a CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500A) positioned at a certain height above the ground. The method collects data at a high frequency (10Hz) and processes it into 30-minute averages using software like Eddypro. The processing involves steps like despiking, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and density corrections, among others, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the flux measurements. The data collected includes variables such as wind direction, horizontal and lateral wind speeds, virtual temperature, water vapor density, CO2 concentration, friction velocity, Obukhov length, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and CO2 flux, with quality assessments for each flux value.",

                    "Answer": "Data gaps in eddy covariance measurements can occur due to several factors, including insufficient power supply during winter months, which leads to missing data. Additionally, instrument errors and weather conditions such as precipitation can also result in data exclusion. Specifically, data collected during instrument malfunctions, precipitation events, and when the missing rate of original 10Hz data exceeds 10% within a 30-minute period are excluded.",

                    "Answer": "Using Eddy covariance systems with specific processing steps such as coordinate rotation and frequency response correction can enhance the reliability and accuracy of surface flux measurements by correcting for potential errors introduced by instrument misalignment and response time. These steps ensure that the data reflects true atmospheric conditions, allowing for more accurate assessments of sensible heat, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes in high-altitude meadow ecosystems.",

These steps include despiking to remove outliers, time delay correction, coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, correction for sonic virtual temperature, and correction for density (WPL correction). Additionally, quality assessment of flux values is performed, mainly testing atmospheric stationarity (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). The data is further filtered to exclude erroneous instrument data, data from one hour before and after precipitation, and data with a missing rate greater than 10% in every 30-minute segment of the original 10Hz data. The final processed data is averaged over 30-minute periods, resulting in 48 data points per day, with missing data marked as -6999.",
