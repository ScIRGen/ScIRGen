      "description": "The ecological environment in the arid regions of central Asia is fragile and sensitive to global climate change, receiving increasing attention from paleoclimatologists. Previous research has mainly focused on the northwest region of China to the east of the region, while climate proxy records in Central Asia are scarce, especially in the absence of reliable quantitative reconstruction of precipitation. This limits the understanding of regional water and heat allocation and prevents a deeper understanding of the relationship between climate change and the Silk Road civilization. In this study, the collected lake rock cores were divided into samples with a spacing of 1 cm, freeze-dried, and then tested. The samples were placed in a 50 ml test tube, and 1 stone pine spore piece was added as an indicator for calculating pollen concentration. The conventional HCl NaOH HF method is used to remove carbonates, humus, colloids, and silicides from the sample. Add sulfuric acid acetic anhydride, remove the surface protoplasm of pollen, and centrifuge with water until neutral. Introduce a small test tube, drop 2-3 drops of glycerol, seal and store. Under the framework of six AMS14C epochs, spore pollen analysis was conducted on Sasikul Lake in the Pamir Plateau. Based on current representative soil spore pollen data, the WA PLS method was used to quantitatively reconstruct the precipitation change history of the arid region in central Asia over the past 2500 years. The research results show that the herbaceous pollen represented by Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae in the pollen assemblage is absolutely dominant, with a content mostly higher than 80%. The vegetation type is mainly grassland landscape. Among them, during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the drought tolerant Chenopodiaceae pollen reached the highest level in the research section, with an average annual precipitation of 115 mm, which is about 15% lower than modern precipitation, and the climate is relatively dry; During the Little Ice Age (LIA), the pollen content of Artemisia and spruce and fir that prefer cold and humid conditions is relatively high, with an average annual precipitation of 160 mm (up to 210 mm), which is about 20% higher than modern precipitation. The climate is cold and humid. On this basis, combined with high-quality regional temperature records and archaeological data, the possible impact of climate change during historical periods on the evolution of the Silk Road civilization was explored. We believe that the temperature conditions in the water and heat allocation have the most important impact on human activities and the evolution of the Silk Road civilization in the arid regions of central Asia. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, under the warm climate background, the melting water of ice and snow significantly increased, the intensity of human settlement significantly increased, and the Silk Road civilization flourished and developed; In the Ming Dynasty, under cold climate conditions, due to the lack of freshwater input, the intensity of local human settlement was weakened, and the Silk Road civilization significantly declined. So, in the context of global warming and increased precipitation, there are new development opportunities for agriculture and socio-economic development in the arid regions of central Asia.",
      "descriptionCn": "亚洲中部干旱区生态环境脆弱，对全球气候变化响应敏感，越来越受到古气候学家的重视。以往的相关研究主要集中在该区域东侧的中国西北地区，中亚地区的气候代用记录稀少，尤其缺乏可靠的降水定量重建，这限制了对区域水热配置的理解，也无法获取对气候变化与丝路文明关系的深入认识。本研究将采集的湖泊岩芯按照1 cm间距分样，冷冻干燥之后取样测试，将样品放入50 ml试管，并加入 1 粒石松孢子片作为计算花粉浓度的指示剂。采用常规的HCl-NaOH-HF法去除样品中的碳酸盐类、腐殖质和胶体物、硅化物。加入硫酸乙酸酐，去除花粉表层原生质，加水离心至中性。导入小试管，滴入2~3滴甘油，封口保存。在6个AMS14C年代框架下，开展了帕米尔高原Sasikul湖的孢粉分析，进而基于现代表土孢粉数据，利用WA-PLS方法定量重建了亚洲中部干旱区近2500年降水变化历史。研究结果显示，孢粉组合中以蒿属和藜科代表的草本花粉占绝对优势，含量多高于80%，植被类型以草原景观为主。其中，中世纪温暖期（MWP）耐旱的藜科花粉达研究段最高，年降水量平均为115 mm，较现代降水量低15%左右，气候较为干旱；小冰期（LIA）蒿属和喜冷湿的云冷杉花粉含量较高，年降水量平均为160 mm（最高可达210 mm），较现代降水量高20%左右，气候寒冷湿润。在此基础上，结合区域高质量温度记录和考古学资料，探讨了历史时期气候变化对丝路文明演化的可能影响。我们认为水热配置中的温度条件对亚洲中部干旱区人类活动与丝路文明演化的影响最为重要：在隋唐时期，温暖的气候背景下，冰雪融水明显增加，人类定居强度明显提升，丝路文明繁荣发展；而到了明代，寒冷的气候条件下，由于淡水输入的缺乏，从而减弱了当地人类定居强度，丝路文明显著衰退。那么，目前在全球变暖和降水增加的气候背景下，为亚洲中部干旱区农业和社会经济迎来新的发展机会。",

        "The ecological environment of arid central Asia (ACA) is fragile and sensitive to long-term climate change. Recent palaeoclimatological studies have mainly focused on northwestern China, which is located on the eastern side of the region. Holocene palaeoclimate records from the western region of ACA are scarce, thus hindering the exploration of the relationship between climate change and Silk Road civilization. The climate is mainly controlled by the westerly circulation, and the region is characterised by fragile ecosystems and water resources that are sensitive to global climate change. The ACA is a key component of the Silk Road, which is an important pathway for human migration and cultural diffusion between Europe and China. The history of East-West exchanges along the Silk Road can be traced back to prehistoric times. In recent years, pollen-based quantitative palaeoclimatic reconstructions combined with modern pollen databases have significantly improved our understanding regarding past precipitation histories and environmental changes in East Asia."

The core was sampled at 0.5 cm intervals for the top 10 cm and at 1 cm intervals from 10 to 74 cm. The chronology of the core was determined via 210Pb and 137Cs analyses and AMS14C dating. Pollen grains were extracted using the conventional HCl-NaOH-HF treatment, which was conducted at the MOE Key Laboratory of Western China’s Environmental System of Lanzhou University. The pollen grains were identified and counted using a Nikon ECLIPSE-80i optical microscope; at least 400 pollen grains were counted.
