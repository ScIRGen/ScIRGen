            "description": "The data includes the projected annual boundaries of the Tibetan Plateau endorheic lake (closed lake) from 2021 to 2100 under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The study comprehensively considered the key factors of the lake, including precipitation, glacier meltwater, land evapotranspiration, and lake surface evaporation, and projected the changes in the endorheic lake from 2021 to 2100 under SSPs scenario. The lake boundary is generated based on NASADEM (30 meter resolution) and then converted into a vector file. The data format is shpfile (shp). Given the current trend of continuous expansion of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, projecting future changes in lakes on the Tibetan Plateau is of great significance for protecting infrastructure and ecological environment security. This data can be used to analyze the potential impact of lake expansion on the surrounding society and environment.",
