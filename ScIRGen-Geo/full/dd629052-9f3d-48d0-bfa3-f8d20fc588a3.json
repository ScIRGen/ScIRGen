      "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Sidaoqiao Superstation in the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2019. There were BLS900, BLS450 and RR-RSS460 at Sidaoqiao Superstation. The north towers were set up with these instruments’ receivers and the south towers were transmitters. The site (north: 101.137° E, 42.008° N; south: 101.131° E, 41.987 N) was located in Ejinaqi, Inner Mongolia. The underlying surfaces between the two towers were tamarisk, populus, bare land and farmland. The elevation is 873 m. The effective height of the LAS was 25.5 m, and the path length was 2350 m. The data were sampled 1 minute.\nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 exceeded the saturated criterion (BLS900&BLS450：Cn2>7.25E-14，RR-RSS460：Cn2>7.84 E-14). (2) The data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS900&BLS450：Average X Intensity<1000；RR-RSS460：Demod>-20mv). (3) The data were rejected when collected during precipitation. (4) The data were rejected if collected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). In the iteration process, the universal functions of Thiermann and Grassl (1992) and Andreas (1988) were selected for BLS900 and RR-RSS460, respectively. Detailed can refer to Liu et al. (2011, 2013). Due to instrument adjustment and inadequate power supply, the date of missing data for the large aperture scintillator is: 2019.04.14-2019.04.25；2019.11.02-2019.11.12。\nSeveral instructions were included with the released data. (1) The las data are firstly from BLS900, followed by BLS450, and finally the final missing data was marked with-6999. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: Date/time (yyyy/m/d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xlsx format. \nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
        "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
        "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The meteorological parameters were measured every 10 min and included air temperature, wind speed, humidity at 5 m over the ground, four-component radiations (measured at 12 m above the ground using a four-component radiometer), and turbulent fluxes (measured at 4.5 m above the ground using an EC system with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz). The soil heat fluxes were measured using three heat plates located 6 cm under the ground. A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

To calculate the component temperatures, the visible and NIR images were classified into soil and canopy pixels using the maximum-likelihood method. Next, the soil and canopy directional brightness temperatures were exacted from the thermal images. Finally, the thermal infrared temperatures were converted to the radiation temperatures using the incoming long-wave radiation from the sky and the soil and canopy emissivities.

        "The alpine region is important in riverine and watershed ecosystems as a contributor of freshwater, providing and stimulating specific habitats for biodiversity. In parallel, recent climate change, human activities, and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. Water resources in the alpine region are headwaters that need to be regulated to sustain downstream ecosystems. However, perturbations induced by nature/climate change and human activities in recent years have significantly reformed hydrological processes and eco-functions. Accurate estimation and prediction of hydrological processes and their key impact factors has since become crucial.",
        "Unfortunately, the scarcity of observation data in the alpine region, due to the difficulties of access and technological barriers, has hindered alpine hydrological modeling and associated research yet motivated the development of next-generation ecosystem observation networks and experiments. In comparison with the observations, using remote sensing data combined with data assimilation could improve the prediction of hydrological processes. However, due to the complexities of the earth system, there exist various sources of uncertainties in remote sensing data (especially in the alpine region), which have to be validated and calibrated. In summary, to fill the knowledge gap and promote alpine region hydrology research, an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation dataset is essential and expected to provide accurate forcing data for hydrological modeling, validate remote sensing data, allow the evaluation of distributed models and ultimately improve a predictive understanding of alpine hydrological processes and ecosystem functions. In alpine hydrology, in addition to consistent hydrometeorological data obtained from distributed meteorological stations, snow cover and frozen ground are two important indexes and driving forces that manipulate hydrological processes. The maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) before ablation determines the storage of snowmelt – a major source of freshwater in the alpine region, while freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) and soil moisture within the active layer alter water infiltration and, consequently, surface runoff and groundwater. To promote alpine hydrology research, the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (INARCH) was launched in 2015 by the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), involving 18 catchments around the world. The INARCH has since connected individual observatories into an international network and data-share platform to lead frontier research on alpine region hydrometeorology and snow observation. Another community-based observation network, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, was initiated in the early 1990s to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China and is known for its heterogeneous landscapes, diverse ecosystems, unique geographical characteristics and climate change over recent decades. As a major component of the ecohydrological processes in the arid/semi-arid HRB, the alpine hydrological processes, especially those related to snow cover and frozen ground in the upper reaches, have great impacts on runoff in the mountainous region, which then regulate agricultural development in the middle reaches and the ecosystems of the lower reaches.",
        "In recent years, with climate warming, permafrost degradation has significantly affected runoff and the carbon cycle (Peng et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018). Snow cover is widely distributed with unique characteristics in the study area. In the high-altitude mountainous region (elevation > 3800 m), influenced by the local microclimate and low temperature, snowfall could occur in any season. Temporary snow is the major snow cover type in the region at middle and low elevations because strong solar radiation and high air temperature lead to fast melting and sublimation of the snow. Drifting snow is also commonly observed in the region, which may lead to the redistribution of snowpack in high elevation regions (Essery et al., 1999; Li et al., 2014).",

At the basin scale, the observation aims to collect data for investigating the meteorological driving forces and for validation of the alpine hydrological models. At the sub-basin scale, small-scale observations and measurements focus on data such as precipitation, soil temperature and moisture, which are used to develop and improve hydrologic models, as well as to validate remote sensing products at medium to coarse resolutions (Jin et al., 2014). At the two superstations for snow cover and frozen ground observations, remote sensing products can be further validated using fine-resolution data. In total, seven AMSs, as well as the frozen ground and snow superstations (also incorporating meteorological observations), were established in the study area during the intensive observation period (IOP: 2013 -2014) to obtain the spatially distributed meteorological variables. After the IOP, four typical AMSs were selected and retained for continuous observation, which is expected to provide long-term datasets. The observed meteorological variables include wind (speed and direction), air temperature, humidity, infrared temperature, air pressure, four-component radiation, and precipitation. Accumulation and depletion processes were measured automatically at the Yakou snow superstation. The observed components included snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE, measured by GammaMONitor, GMON), albedo of the snow surface and blowing (drifting) snow flux (measured by FlowCapt). Soil temperature and moisture were measured within six layers at each AMS, while evapotranspiration (ET) was observed by eddy covariance (EC) at three AMSs located in permafrost, seasonally frozen ground and a transient zone to observe freeze-thaw (FT) processes. At the sub-basin scale, a wireless sensor network (WSN) with 40 nodes was established to capture seasonal changes in soil temperature and moisture. At the A’rou frozen ground superstation, soil temperature and moisture profiles were intensively measured in eighteen layers to a depth of 3.2 m (in a nested pattern with more layers in the topsoil) to obtain the soil hydrothermal features under freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). In addition, thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil were also measured to observe the dynamic hydrothermal processes within.",
