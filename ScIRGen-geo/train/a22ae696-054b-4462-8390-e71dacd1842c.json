            "description": "Formation of a pluripotency-specific chromatin network is a critical event in reprogramming somatic cells into pluripotent status. To characterize the regulatory components in this process, we used ‘chromatin RNA in situ reverse transcription sequencing’(CRIST-seq) to profile RNA components that interact with the pluripotency master gene Oct4.    Using this approach, we identified a novel nuclear lncRNA Oplr16 that was closely involved in the initiation of reprogramming.    Oplr16 not only interacted with the Oct4 promoter and regulated its activity, but it was also specifically activated during reprogramming to pluripotency.    Active expression of Oplr16 was required for optimal maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.    Oplr16 was also able to enhance reprogramming of fibroblasts into pluripotent cells.    RNA reverse transcription-associated trap sequencing (RAT-seq) indicated that Oplr16 interacted with multiple target genes related to stem cell selfrenewal.    Of note, Oplr16 utilized its 3 -fragment to recruit the chromatin factor SMC1 to orchestrate pluripotency-specific intrachromosomal looping.    After binding to the Oct4 promoter, Oplr16 recruited TET2 to induce DNA demethylation and activate Oct4 in fibroblasts, leading to enhanced reprogramming.   These data suggest that Oplr16 may act as a pivotal chromatin factor to control stem cell fate by modulating chromatin architecture and DNA demethylation.",

These interactions are critical for the initiation of reprogramming into a pluripotent state. Oplr16, in particular, not only influences the Oct4 promoter but also recruits chromatin factors like SMC1 to form pluripotency-specific chromosomal loops, and recruits the demethylase TET2 to induce DNA demethylation, thus enhancing reprogramming efficiency in fibroblasts. These findings suggest that RNA components are essential regulators of chromatin structure and have a significant impact on stem cell fate by modulating the chromatin landscape and DNA methylation status.",
