      "description": "Mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at a depth of zero annual amplitude and permafrost thermal stability type are fundamental importance for engineering planning and design, ecosystem management in permafrost region. This dataset is produced by integrating remotely sensed freezing degree-days and thawing degree-days, snow cover days, leaf area index, soil bulk density, high-accuracy soil moisture data, and in situ MAGT measurements from 237 boreholes for the 2010s (2005-2015) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) by using an ensemble learning method that employs a support vector regression (SVR) model based on distance-blocked resampling training data with 200 repetitions. Validation of the new permafrost map indicates that it is probably the most accurate of all available maps at present. The RMSE of MAGT is approximately 0.75 °C and the bias is approximately 0.01 °C. This map shows that the total area of permafrost on the TP is approximately 115.02 (105.47-129.59) *104 km2. The areas corresponding to the very stable, stable, semi-stable, transitional, and unstable types are 0.86*104 km2, 9.62*104 km2, 38.45*104 km2, 42.29*104 km2, and 23.80*104 km2, respectively. This new dataset is available for evaluate the permafrost change in the future on the TP as a baseline.

        "The Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is also called Earth's \"Third Pole\", is the highest and most extensive plateau in the world. The area of high-elevation permafrost on the TP ranks first in the world among middle- and low-latitude permafrost regions, and the permafrost in this region is very sensitive to the increasing warming rate. Significant degradation of permafrost in most sub-regions of the TP has occurred and continues to occur. The presence of permafrost and its changes alter or modify soil hydrothermal and biological processes, thereby affecting ecosystem service functions and water systems. In particular, the degradation of permafrost may affect the stability of infrastructure by reducing the substrate strength and increasing soil permeability, mass movement frequency, thermokarst activity and greenhouse gas fluxes. Existing maps of permafrost/frozen soil on the TP include the China Map of Snow, Ice, and Frozen Ground (1:4000000), the Tibetan Plateau Permafrost Map (1:3000000), the Circum-Arctic Permafrost and Ground-ice Conditions Map (1:10000000), the China Map of Geocryological Regionalization and Classification (1:10000000), the China Map of Glaciers, Frozen Ground and Deserts (1:4000000), and two recently produced permafrost maps that are both derived from a temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model. These maps indicate different levels of understanding of the permafrost distribution in different periods, and both contribute to the improvement of permafrost mapping on the TP. However, from the perspective of current knowledge and data accumulation, these existing permafrost maps have two weaknesses. First, the classification systems used in these maps are based on the areal continuity of permafrost, which is defined by the areal fraction of permafrost, except that the map of Zou et al. (2017) provides only the permafrost extent. This was mainly influenced by the system used in both the former Soviet Union and North America, where high-latitude permafrost zones predominate. However, permafrost at high elevations differs substantially from permafrost at high latitudes. There is an obvious vertical zonation in the distribution of high-elevation permafrost. The vertical projection of so-called \"continuous permafrost\" on a horizontal plane is usually not continuous but isolated. Therefore, the continuity-based system is not suitable for describing high-elevation permafrost. In addition, continuity is a relative term and depends on the map scale. This ambiguous definition of continuity and differences in mapping scale may lead to confusion and inconsistency in the mapped distribution of permafrost. Moreover, traditional permafrost mapping is limited by data scarcity. Global and regional permafrost mapping traditionally relies on in situ air temperature measurement data, but meteorological stations are sparse and unevenly distributed on the TP, with compromised representativeness. Only a few stations are distributed in the permafrost regions. The scarcity of such data is an obstacle for high-resolution permafrost mapping."

        "青藏高原（TP），也被称为地球的“第三极”，是世界上最高、最广泛的高原。青藏高原上的高海拔永久冻土面积在中低纬度永久冻土区域中排名第一，而该地区的永久冻土对日益增加的变暖速率非常敏感。青藏高原大部分子区域的永久冻土已经发生并持续发生显著退化。永久冻土的存在及其变化改变或修饰土壤的水热和生物过程，从而影响生态系统服务功能和水系统。特别是，永久冻土的退化可能通过降低基底强度和增加土壤渗透性、质量运动频率、热融陷活动和温室气体通量来影响基础设施的稳定性。现有的青藏高原永久冻土/冰冻土图包括中国雪、冰和冰冻土图（1:4000000）、青藏高原永久冻土图（1:3000000）、环北极永久冻土和地面冰条件图（1:10000000）、中国冰冻土地质区域化和分类图（1:10000000）、中国冰川、冰冻土和沙漠图（1:4000000），以及两幅最近制作的永久冻土图，这两幅图均基于永久冻土顶部温度（TTOP）模型。这些地图表明了不同时间段对永久冻土分布的不同理解水平，并且都为改善青藏高原的永久冻土制图做出了贡献。然而，从当前知识和数据积累的角度来看，这些现有的永久冻土地图存在两个弱点。首先，这些地图使用的分类系统基于永久冻土的面积连续性，该连续性是由永久冻土的面积比例定义的，除了Zou等（2017）的地图仅提供永久冻土的范围外。这主要受到前苏联和北美使用的系统的影响，在这些地区高纬度永久冻土区占主导地位。然而，高海拔地区的永久冻土与高纬度地区的永久冻土有显著不同。高海拔永久冻土的分布存在明显的垂直分带。所谓“连续永久冻土”的垂直投影在水平面上通常不是连续的，而是孤立的。因此，基于连续性的系统不适合描述高海拔永久冻土。此外，连续性是一个相对的术语，取决于地图的比例。这种模糊的连续性定义和制图比例的差异可能导致永久冻土分布的混淆和不一致。此外，传统的永久冻土制图受到数据稀缺的限制。全球和区域的永久冻土制图传统上依赖于现场气温测量数据，但气象站在青藏高原上稀疏且分布不均，代表性受到影响。在永久冻土区域仅分布有少数气象站。这种数据的稀缺性是高分辨率永久冻土制图的障碍。"
