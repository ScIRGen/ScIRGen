It includes Latin and Chinese names of families, genera and species, times, places of origin, morphological descriptions, discussions, specimens and references. The species names are assigned according to the original literature. For fossil records revised by later research, the revised records were chosen; The age of the origin (fossil site) is assigned according to the latest literature. The terms and description paradigm of leaf shape description are referred to the book \"Leaf Structure Manual\"; The length, angle, and other measurement data in the description are derived from the original literature. The fossil records of the document are sorted alphabetically by Latin initials of families and genera. The data can provide important clues for studying the coupling relationship between the environmental climate changed and the evolution of vegetation and plant diversity in the Cenozoic Qinghai Tibetan Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "An example of data collection methods in paleobotany involves compiling a catalog of large plant fossils from the Tibetan Plateau, including leaves, seeds, and fruits. This process includes recording the Latin and Chinese names of the plant species, their geological age, locality, morphological descriptions, discussions, specimen details, and reference literature. The fossil names are cross-verified with the original literature and updated based on revisions. The age of fossil localities is based on the latest literature results for those sites. Leaf morphology descriptions follow the terminology and paradigms from the 'Leaf Architecture Manual,' and measurements like length and angle are taken from original literature data and images. This dataset can provide critical insights into the evolutionary coupling between climate changes and plant diversity on the Tibetan Plateau during the Cenozoic by offering comprehensive references to the environmental and vegetative transformations over time.",
