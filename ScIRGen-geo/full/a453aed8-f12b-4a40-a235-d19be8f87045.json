            "description": "The monthly precipitation data set of China's alpine mountains includes the qilian mountains (1960-2013), tianshan mountains (1954-2013) and Yangtze river source (1957-2014).\nThe distributed hydrological model needs high-precision spatial distribution information of precipitation as input.Because of the scarcity of stations, the precipitation interpolation at stations cannot reflect the spatial distribution of precipitation in the alpine mountainous areas.Generation method of this dataset:\n(1) collect precipitation data of national meteorological stations and hydrological stations in various regions, and add precipitation observation data of field stations of Chinese academy of sciences above an altitude of 4000m;\n(2) use the temperature data of each station to correct the collected precipitation data of different precipitation types;\n(3) establish the relationship between precipitation data and altitude, longitude and latitude, and fit monthly to generate monthly precipitation data set of 1km scale.\nThe interpolation year of this data is 1954-2014. The data projection method is Albers projection. The spatial interpolation precision is 1-km, and the time precision is monthly data.The results show that the interpolation precipitation is reliable.\nThe data is stored in ASCII files. The file names of the monthly precipitation data files of tianshan mountain and Yangtze river source are in the form yyyymm.txt. YYYY is the year and MM is the month.The monthly precipitation data of qilian mountain is named as: month_10001.txt, this file is the precipitation data of January 1960, successively month_10002.txt is the precipitation of February 1960, and month_10013.txt is the precipitation data of January 1961,......Month_10648.txt represents the precipitation data for December 2013.Each ASCII file represents the grid precipitation data of the day in mm.",

                    "Answer": "The necessity of correcting precipitation data using temperature records in high-altitude regions arises because the sparse distribution of meteorological and hydrological stations makes it difficult to capture the spatial variability of precipitation. Additionally, different types of precipitation, influenced by temperature variations, require adjustments to ensure accuracy. Collecting temperature data helps in differentiating these precipitation types and correcting the precipitation records accordingly.",

                    "Answer": "Incorporating elevation, longitude, and latitude into spatial interpolation methods can enhance the reliability of monthly precipitation datasets by providing more accurate spatial distribution information. This approach allows for the creation of a 1-km scale dataset that captures the complex terrain influences on precipitation patterns, which is crucial in regions with sparse station data. The resulting datasets, validated through cross-validation and station observation data, demonstrate improved reliability in representing precipitation spatial distribution in high-altitude regions.",

                    "Answer": "The main goal of developing a dataset with monthly precipitation data in high-altitude cold regions such as the Qilian Mountains, Tianshan, and the source of the Yangtze River from 1954 to 2014 is to provide high-precision precipitation spatial distribution information required for distributed hydrological models. This is particularly important because the sparse distribution of stations makes it difficult to capture the spatial distribution of precipitation accurately. The dataset, therefore, aims to overcome this challenge by integrating data from various meteorological and hydrological stations, correcting precipitation data with temperature information, and fitting relationships between precipitation and geographical variables like elevation, longitude, and latitude to produce reliable interpolated precipitation data at a 1 km spatial resolution on a monthly basis.",

                    "Answer": "To generate a high-resolution monthly precipitation dataset for high-altitude mountainous regions, the following procedural steps are involved: (1) Collect and organize precipitation data from national meteorological stations and hydrological stations, including newly added precipitation observation data from Chinese Academy of Sciences field stations located above 4000 meters elevation. (2) Use temperature data from various stations to correct the collected precipitation data for different types of precipitation. (3) Establish relationships between precipitation data and altitude, longitude, and latitude, and fit these relationships monthly to generate a 1km resolution monthly precipitation dataset. The data undergoes cross-validation and station observation data validation to ensure the reliability of the interpolated precipitation.",
