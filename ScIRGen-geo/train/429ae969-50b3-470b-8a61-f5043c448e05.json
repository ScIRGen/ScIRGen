            "titleEn": "WATER: Dataset of airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands) mission in the Biandukou-Linze flight zone on Jul. 4, 2008",
            "description": "This data set was acquired by L & K band airborne microwave radiometer on July 4, 2008, in the Biandukou-Linze flight zone. \nThe frequency of L-band is 1.4GHz, and the backsight is 35 degrees to obtain dual polarization (H and V) information; the frequency of K-band is 18.7ghz, and there is no polarization information. The plane took off from Zhangye airport at 9:48 (Beijing time, the same below) and landed at 14:14. 10: At 16-11:40, the flight altitude was 3100-3500m and the flight speed was about 230-250km / hr. 12: 16-12:18 low flying Linze reservoir line 1-6, relative altitude 100m, flight speed 190km / hr. 12: At 26-13:42, he worked in Linze photography area, with a flight altitude of about 2000m and a flight speed of about 250km / hr. 13: 49-13:51 fly low again to Linze reservoir line 1-6. \nThe original data is divided into two parts: microwave radiometer data and GPS data. The L and K bands of microwave radiometer are non imaging observations. The digital values obtained from the instantaneous observation are recorded in the text file, and the longitude and latitude as well as the aircraft attitude parameters are recorded in the GPS data. When using microwave radiometer to observe data, it is necessary to convert the digital value recorded into the bright temperature value according to the calibration coefficient (the calibration coefficient file is filed with the original observation data). At the same time, through the clock records of microwave radiometer and GPS, we can connect the microwave observation with GPS record and match the geographic coordinate information for the microwave observation. Due to the coarse observation resolution of microwave radiometer, the effects of aircraft yaw, roll and pitch are generally ignored in data processing. According to the target and flight relative altitude (H), after calibration and coordinate matching, the observation information can also be gridded. The resolution (x) of L band and K band is consistent with that of observation footprint. The reference resolution is: L band, x = 0.3H; K band, x = 0.24h. After the above steps, we can get the products that users can use directly.",

                    "Answer": "When utilizing non-imaging L&K band airborne microwave radiometer data in conjunction with GPS data for geolocation, the potential outcomes on accuracy and applicability include increased precision in assigning geographic coordinates to microwave observations, despite the coarse resolution of the radiometer data. This integration allows for the conversion of recorded digital values into brightness temperatures, which can then be spatially matched with geographic positions. The use of calibration coefficients ensures that the data is accurate and can be directly used by end-users. However, due to the coarse resolution of radiometer observations, aircraft yaw, roll, and pitch effects are typically ignored, potentially limiting the precision of the geolocation. The processed data can be rasterized to match the footprint resolution, which for L-band is 0.3 times the relative flight altitude (H), and for K-band is 0.24 times H, leading to the creation of user-ready products that can effectively support various applications in remote sensing.",

Geographic information is integrated into this process by using the timestamps from both the microwave radiometer and GPS data to link microwave observations with GPS records, thereby associating microwave observations with geographical coordinates.
