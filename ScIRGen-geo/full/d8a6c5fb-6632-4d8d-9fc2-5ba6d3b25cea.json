Referring to the newly released Flood Control Standard GB 50201-2014, a policy based data set of China's flood control level was constructed and validated, which was relatively accurate. In 171 random sample counties, the matching rate between the dataset and the design text reached 53.2%. The dataset will be open to access, encouraging relevant users to use and improve.

                "China is one of the most flood-prone countries, and development within floodplains is intensive. Flood protection level (FPL) is the degree to which a flood-prone location is protected against flooding. High FPLs reduce the frequency of floods in flood-prone areas and decrease flood risk. From a cost–benefit view, high FPLs are more economically attractive in areas with a high density of population and economy. China is one of the countries that experience the most serious floods and the fastest urbanization. Between 1990 and 2017, floods in China on average affected 149 million people, led to 2165 deaths, and caused economic damage of USD 34 billion per year. Moreover, flood risk changes rapidly due to socioeconomic dynamics and, in the longer-term, due to climate change. However, little information is available about China’s FPLs, which hampers reliable flood risk assessment and challenges risk management. The existing few studies of China’s FPLs, to our best knowledge, are only about a specific flood control facility and at local scales."

                "Based on the flood-protection prescriptions contained in the national flood policies, this paper develops a dataset of likely FPLs for China and investigates the protection granted to different demographic groups. Therefore, the paper here develops and validates the first FPL dataset for China based on the current Chinese policy on FPLs, the Standard for flood control (standard no. GB 50201-2014), which clearly stated how an area should be protected according to the exposed elements. On this basis, the following questions are addressed. (1) What level of protection against river floods does Chinese policy imply across the country? (2) Since the FPL policy does not consider population demographics, what are the implications for the protection of vulnerable social groups?"
            ],
            "challenges": [
                "However, flood protection levels (FPLs) across the country are mostly unknown, hampering the present assertive efforts on flood risk management. The underestimation of Chinese FPLs can at least partially explain the high level of flood risk in previous studies. The residual flood risk can be higher if the real-world flood protection lags behind the policy requirement and design. Unfortunately, a survey in 2013 found that 44 % (284) of the 642 Chinese cities did not update their flood protection planning according to their socioeconomic growth."

            "methods": [
                "Here a framework is developed using spatial information on these indicators of exposure to infer the policy-prescribed FPLs across China. In the study framework, based on the relevant datasets, the FPL of an urban county (in Chinese: shi or qu) is evaluated by population exposure and GDP-weighted population exposure; the FPL of a rural county (xian) is evaluated by the population exposure and arable-land exposure. The FPLs are assessed for 2237 counties that fully or partially fall within the 100-year floodplain. Local documents of flood protection design are collected to verify the policy-based FPL results. The validation counties are selected based on the date of the flood protection design: the data should represent the flood protection of the year 2015. The spatial pattern of the FPL data is then identified using the LISA (local indicator of spatial association) or local Moran’s I. The local Moran’s I is calculated by applying the queen contiguity matrix in the GeoDa software program (version 1.12). The exposed vulnerable population comprises the exposed children and elders because children and elders are generally considered more vulnerable to flooding, due to limited mobility and physical resistance."

Second, an undefended fluvial flood depth map with a return period of 100 years is provided by the CIMA (Centro Internazionale in Monitoraggio Ambientale) Research Foundation. Third, population density maps for 1990 and 2015 are acquired from the China Temporal Datasets of the Harvard Dataverse, published by the WorldPop program. Fourth, the demographic information of 1990 and 2015 is obtained from China’s national census data. Fifth, the land use data of China for 2015 comes from the Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Besides, the county-level GDP in 2015 is used to calculate the GDP-weighted population exposure."

A considerable proportion (33.1 % or 741) of the evaluated Chinese counties are protected with an FPL of ≥30 years, which is much higher than that in the global FLOPROS database. The FPLs show significant divergence between eastern and western China, reflecting general differences in population exposure and in economic performance. A majority (52.3 % or 38.3 million) of the exposed vulnerable population is concentrated in low-FPL (< 50 years) counties, higher than these counties’ share of the total exposed population (44.9 %). The newly developed FPL dataset reflects how China should be protected against river floods according to the flood protection policy."

The FPL dataset's spatial pattern can be identified using methods like LISA (local indicator of spatial association) or local Moran’s I, ensuring consistency and accuracy with local design documents.",

This is further supported by datasets like administrative boundaries, fluvial flood depth maps, population density maps, national census data, land use data, and county-level GDP.",

                    "Answer": "Flood protection levels across the country are mostly unknown, hampering assertive efforts on flood risk management. The residual flood risk can be higher if the real-world flood protection lags behind the policy requirement and design. Additionally, 44% of Chinese cities did not update their flood protection planning according to their socioeconomic growth.",

                    "Answer": "Since the flood protection level policy does not consider population demographics, there are implications for the protection of vulnerable social groups. A majority of the exposed vulnerable population is concentrated in low-FPL (< 50 years) counties, higher than these counties’ share of the total exposed population.",

                    "Answer": "The use of spatial information indicators to infer flood protection levels across China is a systematic approach to evaluate flood protection levels based on exposure indicators. This method allows for an assessment at a county level, considering the population and economic exposure, which provides a more detailed understanding of local flood protection needs. The validation with local flood protection design documents adds credibility to the inferred data, but challenges remain in ensuring comprehensive data collection and addressing discrepancies between policy-prescribed and actual protection levels.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating demographic and land use data in assessing flood protection levels offers a comprehensive view of how different regions are exposed to flood risks. The benefits include a more accurate representation of vulnerability, especially for rural and urban populations, and the ability to tailor flood protection policies to specific local needs. However, the drawbacks may include the complexity of acquiring and processing diverse datasets, potential data discrepancies, and the need to regularly update data to reflect ongoing changes in land use and demographics.",

                    "Answer": "The assessment considers demographic factors by evaluating the exposure of vulnerable populations, such as children and elders, who are generally more vulnerable to flooding. The findings indicate that a large proportion of the exposed vulnerable population resides in counties with low flood protection levels (FPL < 50 years), highlighting potential risks and the need for targeted protection policies for these groups.",
