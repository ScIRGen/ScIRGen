            "description": "This data set mainly includes the whole rock SR Nd isotopic data of 83 magmatic rocks from the Hoh Xil- basin to Lhasa block in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The samples are mainly distributed in Hoh Xil- lake, Guoganjianian in the South Qiangtang, Dugur, Nasongduo and Saga counties in the Gangdise. Rock samples include olivine leucite, quartz monzonite, diorite and granite. The data mainly come from published articles or articles in the acceptance stage. MC-ICP-MS was used to measure SR Nd isotopes in Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences and other key laboratories. The published articles of the data set have been included in high-level SCI or Ni journals, and the data results are true and reliable. In the future, it can be used to study the lithospheric evolution and magmatic genesis of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",
