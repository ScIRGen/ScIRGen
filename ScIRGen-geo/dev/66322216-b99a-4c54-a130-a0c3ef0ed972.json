            "description": "Agricultural irrigation, which accounts for about 80% of human water consumption, is the most important part of human water resources management and closely related to human survival and development.Irrigation is also an important part of the water cycle. Large-scale irrigation can affect the water cycle and even the local climate by affecting evapotranspiration.Excessive diversion of irrigation water will lead to unsustainable utilization of water resources, and at the same time, will reduce river flow and aquifer water reserves, thus harming the ecological environment.\nTherefore, determining the spatial and temporal distribution and variation of irrigation is critical to studying past human water use, the impact of irrigation on ecological and hydrological processes, the environment and climate, and the development of future irrigation plans.\nBy integrating the irrigation amount of channel diversion water and irrigation amount of groundwater intake from different data sources, and combining the evapotranspiration data of land surface model CLM4.5 simulation and remote sensing inversion, a set of spatio-temporal continuous surface water and groundwater irrigation amount data set with spatial resolution of 30 arcseconds (0.0083 degrees) on the scale of 1981-2013 in heihe river basin was made.\nIt has been verified that this data set has a high reliability from 2000 to 2013, and a lower reliability from 1981 to 1999 than from 2000 to 2013 due to the absence of remote sensing data and the absence of soil utilization changes.\nThe document is described as follows:\nMonthly surfacewater irrigation volume file name: monthly_surfacewater_irrigation gation_1981-2013.nc\nMonthly groundwater_irrigation gation_1981-2013.nc\nThe data is in netcdf format.There are three dimensions, which are month, lat, and lon.\nWhere, month is a month, and the value is 0-395, representing each month from 1981 to 2013. Lat is grid latitude information, and lon is grid longitude information.",

                    "Answer": "Combining multiple data sources and methods, such as river diversion records, groundwater extraction data, and remote sensing for evapotranspiration, can enhance the spatial and temporal continuity of a dataset, thereby improving reliability. However, the reliability may vary over time, as seen in the higher confidence in data from 2000-2013 due to the availability of remote sensing data, compared to 1981-1999, where the absence of remote sensing support and exclusion of land use changes result in lower confidence.",

Irrigation is a significant component of water management and water cycling, affecting evapotranspiration and potentially impacting local climate. Excessive water diversion for irrigation can lead to unsustainable water resource use and harm ecological environments by reducing river flows and aquifer water storage.",

The dataset covers the period from 1981 to 2013 at a 30-arc second spatial resolution.
