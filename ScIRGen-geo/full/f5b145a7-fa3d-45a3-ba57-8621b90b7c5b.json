            "description": "By archaeological investigation and excavation in Tibetan Plateau, we discovered 14 historic period sites, including Meinuo, Sariguo, Rongwaguo, Kaze, Jiha, Yarigei, Bami, Barongbadang, Qingtu, Labu ,Maisong Petroglyph, Gala, Yezere 1 and Yezere 4 . In this dataset, there are some basic informations about these sites, such as location, longitude, latitude, altitude, material culture and so on. On this Basis, we identified animal remains, plant macrofossil, selected some samples for radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. This dataset provide important basic data for understanding when and how prehistoric human lived in the Tibetan Plateau during the historic period.",

During these activities, basic information like site coordinates, elevation, and cultural attributes are collected. In parallel, plant and animal remains found during these surveys are scientifically collected, identified, and analyzed in laboratories. This includes obtaining carbon-14 dating data and animal remains identification data, which are crucial for understanding the historical activities and subsistence patterns of ancient inhabitants on the Tibetan Plateau.",
