            "description": "The lack of long-term and high-quality solar radiation data has been an obstacle for scientific and industrial fields. In this study, a dense station-based long-term and high-accuracy dataset of daily surface solar radiation was developed with two surface radiation models. One is the model developed by Yang et al. (2006) for global radiation estimate, and the other is the model developed by Tang et al. (2018) for direct radiation estimate. The main inputs for developing the dataset are surface pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, horizontal visibility, and sunshine duration, which are the routine meteorological variables observed at the 2743 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) weather stations. Validation against in-situ observations and comparisons with two satellite-based radiation products show that our station-based radiation dataset clearly outperforms the satellite-based radiation products at both daily and monthly scales. In addition, our dataset is available for more than 60 years and includes three radiation components of global, direct and diffuse radiation, which is not possible with satellite products. This station-based radiation dataset will contribute to the climate change research and solar energy engineering applications in the future.",

                "Solar radiation provides energy to everything on Earth; drives the water, energy and carbon cycles of the Earth’s climate system; and largely determines the climatic conditions of human habitats (Wild, 2009). Solar radiation information at the Earth’s surface is crucial in research of agriculture, hydrology, ecology and climate change and in simulations of land surface processes (Wang et al., 2012). Global radiation is an important component of the surface energy budgets (Wild et al., 2015), and accurate global radiation data will contribute to the simulation of land-surface-related processes, such as ecological, hydrological, agricultural and glacial simulations (Tang et al., 2019b). Due to its multi-directional nature, diffuse radiation penetrates the vegetation canopy more than direct radiation, and more diffuse radiation can increase the light energy use efficiency of the canopy (Mercado et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2019). In situ measurements are considered to be the most effective and direct means of obtaining surface solar radiation data. However, the number of radiation observation stations is very low due to high maintenance and calibration costs. Therefore, the lack of long-term and dense solar radiation observations has become a tough challenge. Satellites can provide continuous spatiotemporal observations, and retrieval based on satellite remote sensing is considered to be one of the most effective and commonly used means to fill the gap in ground-based radiation measurements (Lu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Letu et al., 2021)."

This station-based radiation dataset will contribute to the climate change research and solar energy engineering applications in the future. Therefore, these two hybrid models provide us with an opportunity to construct daily surface solar radiation at routine weather stations once the observations of meteorological variables are available. The constructed dataset will contribute to simulations of land surface processes, climate change analysis and solar energy applications. This long-term dataset will contribute to the analysis of long-term variations in surface process simulations and solar energy applications, such as the assessment of solar energy potential, the determination of the optimal angle for solar PV panels and their long-term variation analysis, as well as the assessment of historical extreme events in solar energy systems."

            "challenges": [
                "Another issue is that the radiation observation stations are very unevenly distributed, with most of radiation stations being located in flat and densely populated areas and with a very small number of stations being located in complex-terrain areas and sparsely populated areas. In addition, radiation measurements are considered to be more prone to problems and unreliable data than those of other meteorological variables. For example, erroneous or spurious data were frequently found in the CMA radiation observations (Shi et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2011). Therefore, the lack of long-term and dense solar radiation observations has become a tough challenge. First, the time series of satellite radiation products are generally not long enough to meet the demand for long-time-series data, such as for climate change studies. Second, the updating of satellite sensors and the fusion of multi-source satellites would lead to inconsistent data quality and introduce large uncertainties into the analysis of long-term variations (Feng and Wang, 2021a; Shao et al., 2022). Third, most satellite radiation products only provide global radiation but do not include direct and diffuse radiation because the uncertainty in algorithms for estimating direct and diffuse radiation is much larger than the uncertainty in global radiation."

The methods for estimating daily global, direct and diffuse radiation can be simply described by the following five mathematical formulas: Rg =(Rb,clr +Rd,clr)τc,g, (1) Rb =Rb,clrτc,b, (2) Rd =Rg −Rb, (3) τc,g =0.2505 +1.1468(n/N)−0.3974(n/N)2, (4) τc,b =0.4868(n/N)+0.5132(n/N)2, (5).
