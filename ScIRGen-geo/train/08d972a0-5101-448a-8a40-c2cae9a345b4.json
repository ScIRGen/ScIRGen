            "description": "The database includes the results of field experiments and elevated cross maze experiments conducted from November 2, 2020 to March 15, 2021. Sixty C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group (CON, n=15), diet control group+chronic stress group (CON+CS, n=15), high fat diet+Apoe -/- (HF+Apoe -/-, n=15), and high fat diet+Apoe -/-+chronic stress group (HF+Apoe -/-+CS, n=15). Elevated cross maze and open field tests were conducted to examine the effects of chronic stress. Detect the expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 in the kidney and explore the predictive value of SGLT1/2 expression in renal pathological changes. Edema, reticular fiber rupture, and increased renal glycogen were found to be significant in the HF+Apoe+CS group. Compared with the CON group, the HF+Apoe+CS group showed upregulation of SGLT1/2 expression in the kidneys (P<0.05). There is a positive correlation between renal edema, glycogen, reticular fibers, and SGLT1/2 expression. SGLT1/2 has higher sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing renal edema, reticular fibers, and glycogen. The results of SVM and BP neural network models show that SGLT1 and SGLT2 have better predictive values for renal edema and glycogen.",

These changes are more pronounced in the HF + Apoe-/- + CS group compared to the control group and are positively correlated with renal edema, glycogen, and reticular fiber changes.",
