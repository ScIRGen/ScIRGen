            "description": "The field observation platform of the Tibetan Plateau is the forefront of scientific observation and research on the Tibetan Plateau. The land surface processes and environmental changes based comprehensive observation of the land-boundary layer in the Tibetan Plateau provides valuable data for the study of the mechanism of the land-atmosphere interaction on the Tibetan Plateau and its effects.  This dataset integrates the 2005-2016 hourly atmospheric, soil hydrothermal and turbulent fluxes observations  of Qomolangma Atmospheric and Environmental Observation and Research Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences (QOMS/CAS), Southeast Tibet Observation and Research Station for the Alpine Environment, CAS (SETORS), the BJ site of Nagqu Station of Plateau Climate and Environment, CAS (NPCE-BJ), Nam Co Monitoring and Research Station for Multisphere Interactions, CAS (NAMORS), Ngari Desert Observation and Research Station, CAS (NADORS), Muztagh Ata Westerly Observation and Research Station, CAS (MAWORS).  It contains gradient observation data composed of multi-layer wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, air pressure and precipitation data,  four-component radiation data, multi-layer soil temperature and humidity and soil heat flux  data, and turbulence data composed of sensible heat flux, latent heat flux and carbon dioxide flux. These data can be widely used in the analysis of the characteristics of meteorological elements on the Tibetan Plaetau, the evaluation of remote sensing products and development of the remote sensing retrieval algorithms, and the evaluation and development of numerical models.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau, with the most prominent and complicated terrain on the globe and an elevation averaging more than 4000 m above mean sea level (msl), is often called the “Third Pole” because its geographic significance is akin to that of Antarctica and the Arctic. The thermal effects of the giant plateau on the atmosphere greatly influence circulations over China, eastern Asia and even the globe. The plateau absorbs a large proportion of solar radiation (some of which is redistributed by cryospheric processes) and undergoes dramatic seasonal changes of surface heat and water fluxes. The lack of quantitative understanding of interactions between the land surface and atmosphere makes it difficult to understand and model the complete energy and water cycles over the Tibetan Plateau and their effects on global climate change. Therefore, the number of atmosphere-land interaction studies over the Tibetan Plateau has been increased in recent years."

The diurnal variations of the turbulent fluxes are different during the dry period (pre-monsoon period) and wet period (inside monsoon period). The diurnal variation of momentum flux over the northern Tibetan Plateau area during the dry period is also obvious, increasing in the morning to its maximum in the afternoon, and then decreasing. Sensible heat flux H and latent heat flux LE vary by less than 10% of their magnitude with height over the flat prairie area of Naqu area of the northern Tibetan Plateau. The land surface is a very strong heating source in the day time, it is a weak surface heating sink in the night, but the daily mean is strong surface heating source. The diurnal variation of CO2 flux in summer is obvious over the alpine meadow surface of Mt. Everest area. The plateau ABL can extend to heights of almost 3 km above the ground surface in Naqu area of the northern Tibetan Plateau, and is characterized by a well-mixed layer of potential temperature. The convection over the Tibetan Plateau evolves from dry shallow convection in the morning to wet deep convection in the afternoon. The vertical gradients of potential temperature and humidity in the ABL of the Tibetan Plateau have an obvious sudden change in the middle of June."
