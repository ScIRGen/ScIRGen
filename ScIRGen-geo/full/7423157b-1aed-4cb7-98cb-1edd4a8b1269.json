            "description": "Facing the sustainable development of agriculture in the Central Asia, the risk assessment of the land resources exploitation is carried out with the aim of cultivated land. The evaluation indices of land resources exploitation risk for farmland include topographic factors (such as elevation and slope), precipitation, land use type, soil texture, GDP per capita, grain production per capita, growth rate of agricultural economy, urbanization rate, natural growth rate of population, soil organic matter content, etc. The above indices are normalized dimensionless, and the weight of each index to the risk of land resources exploitation is determined based on the multiple linear regression model between grain production and each index. The datasets include land resources exploitation risk in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 with a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.5°. It is expected to provide basic information for agricultural production and land resources exploitation in five countries in Central Asia.",
