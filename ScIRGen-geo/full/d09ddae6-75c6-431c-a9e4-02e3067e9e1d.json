            "description": "The data set mainly includes the ice observation frequency (ICO) of north temperate lakes in four periods from 1985 to 2020, as well as the location, area and elevation of the lakes. Among them, the four time periods are 1985-1998 (P1), 1999-2006 (P2), 2007-2014 (P3) and 2015-2020 (P4) respectively, in order to improve the \"valid observation\" times in the calculation period and improve the accuracy. The ICO of the four periods is calculated by the ratio of \"icing\" times and \"valid observation\" times counted by all Landsat images in each period. Other lake information corresponds to the HydroLAKEs data set through the \"hylak_id\" column in the table. In addition, the data only retains about 30000 lakes with an area of more than 1 square kilometer, which are valid for P1-P4 observation. The data set can reflect the response of Lake icing to climate change in recent decades.",

                "Half of the world's lakes (approximately 50 million) periodically freeze. The phenology of lake ice (i.e., freeze/thaw dates and duration) not only influences physical conditions (such as heat storage, temperature, mixing) of underlying ecosystems, but also provides important opportunities for transportation, recreation, and fishing for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Recently, widespread reductions in lake ice have been detected at both regional and global scales due to recent climate warming, and this problem is projected to become more severe in the future due to ongoing warming trends and escalating climate extremes. Observations from both field surveys and satellite remote sensing have been widely used to identify historical trends in lake ice cover. Unfortunately, even with the well-maintained in situ data set from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), field records are available for only 631 lakes, and only ∼40 lakes have four decades of continuous records. Furthermore, the in situ lake ice records from NSIDC were spatially biased: few records were collected in Asian lakes or lakes located south of 40°N in the other continents. Although satellite remote sensing offers large-scale and frequent observations, the currently available applications are restricted to individual large lakes or lake districts."

Here, we map ice cover in >33,000 lakes throughout the North Temperate Zone (23.5°–66.5°N) using 0.55 million Landsat images from 1985 to 2020. The high-resolution mapping of lake ice here provides essential baseline information which can be used to elucidate ice loss-induced environmental and societal impacts."

                "However, such efforts are challenging by using Landsat observations alone, where the ice cover conditions may change considerably between subsequent observations (16 days apart), not to mention the potential contamination from cloud coverage. However, the spatial resolution of ERA5-Land data sets is 0.1°, with a native resolution of 9 km. As such, the area of a cell grid size is ∼81 km², which is larger than most examined lakes. Owing to the apparent temperature disparities between water and adjacent land, the extracted gridded temperature may not accurately represent the lake temperature."

                "We mapped lake ice cover over the entire North Temperate Zone using 30-m resolution Landsat satellite observations from 1985 to 2020. We determined lake ice extent for each Landsat image using the Fmask algorithm, which classifies snow/ice pixels using several thresholds (Normalized Difference Snow Index >0.15, Brightness Temperature <0.38, NIR band reflectance <0.11, and green band reflectance >0.1). To estimate the ICO of a lake within a given period, we used the following procedure. First, we counted (a) the number of times when a pixel was labeled snow/ice (Nice) and (b) the number of valid Landsat observations (Nvo) (pixel was not labeled as clouds or cloud shadows) in the first quarter of all years within the period. Second, we normalized Nice against Nvo to calculate the ICO at the pixel level. Pixels with limited valid observations (Nvo <10) were removed from further analysis to avoid meaningless statistics. Third, we estimated the mean value of all pixel-level ICO values within a predefined lake area, representing the ICO of this lake within this period. Validations with in situ records from various lakes distributed globally demonstrated the high reliability of using the Fmask algorithm to classify the status of lake ice from individual images and for ICO calculations at different periods. We estimated the absolute differences in mean temperature between different periods and examined the spatial consistencies of the ICO changes and temperature variability. To explore the impacts of temperature on individual lakes, we performed logistic regression between ICO values of the examined lakes and the corresponding mean temperature."

Lakes in Europe showed the most pronounced ice loss (median ICO decreased from 50% to 24%), and extensive lake ice losses were also detected in the northern US, and central and eastern Asia. An overall increase in ice cover was identified from P2 (1999–2006) to P3 (2007–2014) due to regional decreased temperatures associated with the “global warming hiatus.”"

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves using Landsat satellite observations to map lake ice cover. The Fmask algorithm is applied to classify snow/ice pixels based on several thresholds, such as Normalized Difference Snow Index, Brightness Temperature, and reflectance values in the NIR and green bands. The number of times a pixel is labeled as snow/ice and the number of valid observations without clouds are counted within a defined period. The ICO is calculated by normalizing the snow/ice occurrences against the valid observations. Pixels with fewer than 10 valid observations are excluded to avoid skewed statistics. The mean ICO value for a predefined lake area is estimated for each period.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges are addressed by using a high-resolution mapping technique with Landsat images, which are taken every 16 days. The Fmask algorithm helps classify the ice cover status by using a set of thresholds to ensure reliable pixel classification. Despite cloud coverage and temporal gaps, the procedure ensures enough valid observations are used for ICO estimation by removing pixels with less than 10 valid observations.",

The Fmask algorithm's reliability is assessed by comparing its classifications with these ground-based observations, ensuring accurate representation of lake ice status across different periods. Logistic regression analysis is also performed to explore the relationship between ICO values and mean temperature changes, adding another layer of validation to the findings.",

                    "Answer": "New approaches may be needed because the spatial resolution of datasets like ERA5-Land is relatively coarse compared to most lakes, with a grid size larger than many lakes examined. This discrepancy can lead to inaccuracies in representing lake-specific conditions, emphasizing the need for methods that can better capture the unique environmental conditions of smaller lakes.",

                    "Answer": "Cloud coverage can significantly impact the reliability of satellite-based data collection because clouds can obscure the view of the lake surface in satellite images. In the research approach, the Fmask algorithm was employed to classify snow/ice pixels, and only valid Landsat observations (where pixels were not labeled as clouds or cloud shadows) were used to calculate the ice cover occurrence (ICO). This process helps mitigate the impact of cloud coverage, but it remains a challenge in ensuring consistent data quality.",

Logistic regression is performed between the ICO values of the examined lakes and the corresponding mean temperature to explore the impacts of temperature on individual lakes. This approach helps in understanding the strong relationship between warming terrestrial mean surface temperatures and reductions in median ice cover occurrence.",

The Fmask algorithm is used to determine lake ice extent for each image. The procedure includes calculating the ICO by counting the number of snow/ice occurrences and valid Landsat observations, normalizing these values, and estimating the mean ICO within a predefined lake area. Researchers can then perform logistic regression between ICO values and mean temperature to explore temperature impacts on individual lakes.",
