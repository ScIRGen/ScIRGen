The data includes the following variables: annual average drought duration, annual average severe drought duration, maximum drought duration, period of maximum drought duration, annual average drought frequency, annual average severe drought frequency, annual average drought intensity, annual average severe drought intensity, maximum drought intensity, and period of maximum drought intensity. The spatial range of the dataset is in the central China region, and the data is saved in TIF format. The dataset is used to describe the drought characteristics of the central China region during the research period. The dataset can provide reference for the study of drought characteristics in central China.",

                    "Answer": "The standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index (SPAEI index) refers to a metric used to quantify and analyze drought characteristics. It is calculated based on precipitation and actual evapotranspiration data, capturing the balance between water supply and demand. The SPAEI index can include variables such as average annual drought duration, severe drought duration, maximum drought duration, occurrence period of maximum drought, average drought frequency, severe drought frequency, drought intensity, and severe drought intensity, as well as the timing of maximum drought intensity. This index helps describe the drought characteristics over a specified region and period, providing a reference for researching drought features.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection techniques for deriving the SPAEI involve using CMFD data from 1982-2015 to calculate various drought indices such as annual average drought duration, severity, and frequency within Central China. These techniques focus on spatial analysis and temporal changes over a long period using standardized indices presented in TIF format, which may differ from traditional meteorological data collection that often involves point-based measurements and may not be specifically tailored to capture drought characteristics comprehensively.",

                    "Answer": "The calculation of the standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index (SPAEI) for drought characterization in central China, based on CMFD data, involves capturing various metrics such as annual mean drought duration, severe drought duration, maximum drought duration, and the timing of these events. Challenges may arise from the need to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations across the region, the quality and resolution of input data, and the complexity of modeling evapotranspiration processes. Data is stored in TIF format, which can also present challenges in data handling and processing.",

This information can aid in understanding the temporal and spatial patterns of droughts, helping to improve drought prediction and management strategies.",
