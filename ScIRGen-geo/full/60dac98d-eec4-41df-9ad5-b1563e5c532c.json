            "description": "The data set contains vectorized rooftop area data for 90 cities in China (comprehensively selected according to city administrative level and regional distribution. See Annex 1 for the list of cities). It is mainly based on deep learning semantic segmentation model and multi-source remote sensing images. Firstly, the original image is preprocessed, stratified sampling and visual interpretation are carried out according to the city level and its regional distribution, and the training and test data are made. Then the training data is input into the deep learning semantic segmentation model for training to make it suitable for the building roof extraction task. Based on the test data, the performance of the building roof extraction model is evaluated by using the general index of the result evaluation in the field of deep learning. Finally, this model is applied to the task of building roof extraction in 90 cities in China, and the building roof is automatically extracted and vectorized. The data set can provide important data support for relevant research based on building roofs (such as roof solar potential assessment, urban planning, etc.) in cities and even in the whole country.",

These images were downloaded in October 2020 using Python scripts in the open map service application program interface (Google Earth API) provided by Google. In the present study, we selected 90 cities in China (Table 2), and these were partitioned into four tiers based on the city administration hierarchy established by the government in China. Therefore, standardization procedure for GES imagery is necessary, and in the present study, the Gamma Correction algorithm34 and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization algorithm35 were used to resolve brightness and sharpness issues. Therefore, to obtain representative and balanced positive and negative samples, spatial stratified sampling was employed in the sample acquisition. In the present study, sample images were correspondingly labeled positive and negative manually. During the rooftop extraction model training task, the built-up area covered by the image samples and their corresponding masks was 200 km2, while the confusing area was 160 km2, and thus, the total training samples covering 360 km2. Data augmentation operations used in the present study included the following: random cropping, image rotation, image flipping, image blurring, and noise addition. In the present study, the cross-entropy40 and dice loss functions 41 were integrated to generate a composite loss function that can simultaneously handle the imbalance categories of samples problem and accelerate the convergence of training. Steps implemented in the expansion prediction (Fig. 4) include the following: (1) An n × n sliding window characterized by a step size of n was created. During movement, this window expanded to m × m, and the original remote sensing image was then cropped into small patches. (2) The cropped images were concatenated into a tensor. (3) The ensemble rooftop extraction model was then used to predict the tensor obtained in step 2. (4) The central portion of each n x n tensor element was extracted and split into patches. (5) Patches obtained in step 4 were stitched to produce a large predicted image, which was then cropped based on the original GES image. Four Tesla V100 GPUs were used to train the model using the mixed accuracy method, and the development was based on the Pytorch framework47."
