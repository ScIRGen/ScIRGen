            "description": "The dataset includes the fractional vegetation cover data generated from the stations of crop land, wetland, Gebi desert and desert steppe in Yingke Oasis and biomass data generated from the stations of crop land (corn) and wetland. The observations lasted for a vegetation growth cycle from 19 May, 2012 to 15 September, 2012.\n1.\tFractional vegetation cover observation\n1.1\tObservation time\n1.1.1\tStation of the crop land: The observations lasted from 20 May, 2012 to 15 September, 2012, and in five-day periods for each observation before 31 July and in ten-day periods for each observation after 31 July.\nThe observation time for the station of crop land (corn) are 2013-5-20, 2013-5-25, 2013-5-30, 2013-6-5, 2013-6-10, 2013-6-16, 2013-6-22, 2013-6-27, 2013-7-2, 2013-7-7, 2013-7-12, 2013-7-17, 2013-7-27, 2013-8-3, 2013-8-13, 2013-8-25, 2013-9-5 and 2013-9-15.\n1.1.2\tThe other four stations: The observations lasted from 20 May, 2012 to 15 September, 2012 and in ten-day periods for each observation.\nThe observation time for the crop land are 2013-5-20, 2013-6-5, 2013-6-16, 2013-6-27, 2013-7-7, 2013-7-17, 2013-7-27, 2013-8-3, 2013-8-13, 2013-8-25, 2013-9-5 and 2013-9-15.\n1.2\tmethod\n1.2.1 Instruments and measurement method\nDigital photography measurement is implemented to measure the FVC. Plot positions, photographic method and data processing method are dedicatedly designed. In field measurements, a long stick with the camera mounted on one end is beneficial to conveniently measure various species of vegetation, enabling a larger area to be photographed with a smaller field of view. The stick can be used to change the camera height; a ﬁxed-focus camera can be placed at the end of the instrument platform at the front end of the support bar, and the camera can be operated by remote control.\n1.2.2 Design of the samples\nThree and two plots with the area of 10×10 m^2 were measured for the station of the crop land and wetland, respectively. One plot with the area of 10×10 m^2 was measured for the other three stations. Shoot 9 times along two perpendicularly crossed rectangular-belt transects. The picture generated of each time is used to calculate a FVC value. “True FVC” of the plot is then acquired as the average of these 9 FVC values.\n1.2.3 Photographic method\nThe photographic method used depends on the species of vegetation and planting pattern. A long stick with the camera mounted on one end is used for the stations of crop land and wetland. For the station of the crop land, rows of more than two cycles should be included in the ﬁeld of view (<30), and the side length of the image should be parallel to the row. If there are no more than two complete cycles, then information regarding row spacing and plant spacing are required. The FVC of the entire cycle, that is, the FVC of the quadrat, can be obtained from the number of rows included in the field of view. For other three stations, the photos of FVC were obtained by directly photographing for the lower heights of the vegetation.\n1.2.4 Method for calculating the FVC\nThe FVC calculation was implemented by the Beijing Normal University. The detail method can be found in the reference below. Many methods are available to extract the FVC from digital images, and the degree of automation and the precision of identification are important factors that affect the efficiency of field measurements. This method, which is proposed by the authors, has the advantages of a simple algorithm, a high degree of automation and high precision, as well as ease of operation (see the reference).\n2. Biomass observation\n2.1. Observation time\n2.1.1 Station of the crop land: The observations lasted from 20 May 2012 to 15 September 2012, and in five-day periods for each observation before 31 July and in ten-day periods for each observation after 31 July.\nThe observation time for the crop land are 2013-5-25, 2013-5-30, 2013-6-5, 2013-6-10, 2013-6-16, 2013-6-22, 2013-6-27, 2013-7-2, 2013-7-7, 2013-7-12, 2013-7-17, 2013-7-27, 2013-8-3, 2013-8-13, 2013-8-25, 2013-9-5 and 2013-9-15.\n2.1.2 The station of wetland: The observations lasted from 20 May 2012 to 15 September 2012, and in ten-day periods for each observation.\nThe observation time for the crop land are 2013-6-5, 2013-6-16, 2013-6-27, 2013-7-7, 2013-7-17, 2013-7-27, 2013-8-3, 2013-8-13, 2013-8-25, 2013-9-5 and 2013-9-15.\n2.2. Method\nStation of the crop land: Three plots were selected and three strains of corn for each observation were random selected for each plot to measure the fresh weight (the aboveground biomass and underground biomass) and dry weight. Per unit biomass can be obtained according to the planting structure.\nStation of the wetland: Two plots of reed with the area of 0.5 m × 0.5 m were random selected for each observation. The reed of the two plots was cut to measure the fresh weight (the aboveground biomass) and dry weight.\n2.3. Instruments\nBalance (accuracy 0.01 g); drying oven\n3. Data storage\nAll observation data were stored in excel. Other data including plant spacing, row spacing, seeding time, irrigation time, the time of cutting male parent and the harvest time of the corn for the station of cropland were also stored in the excel.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.
