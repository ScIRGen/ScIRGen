            "description": "The data are the mineralogical and geochemical data of deep-sea REE rich sediments in the central Indian Ocean basin, including core profile photos, smear photos and identification, XRD patterns, SEM photos, major and trace elements of whole sediment, EPMA and La ICP-MS data of single mineral (apatite, micro nodules and calyptosite), organic carbon and nitrogen analysis of whole sediment, and the data of trace elements of whole sediment SR Nd isotopic compositions of whole sediments, REE phase analysis of sediments, REE data of seawater pore water and paleomagnetic data. The analytical samples were collected from the 34th and 42nd voyages of the Chinese ocean, including 6 stations of columnar sediments and 4 stations of seawater. Through the data obtained, we can explore the occurrence minerals and enrichment mechanism of rare earth elements, so as to evaluate and explore the deep-sea rare earth resources in the Indian Ocean.",
