            "description": "The dateset of the ground-based RPG-8CH-DP microwave radiometer observations was obtained in the Biandukou foci experimental area from Mar. 14 to 17, 2008. Observation items included the brightness temperature by the ground-based microwave radiometer (18.7GHz and 36.5GHz), the soil temperature by the thermal resistor, the gravimetric soil moisture by the microwave drying method, and the surface roughness by the grid board.\n     The wheat stubble land (38°15'44.13\"N, 100°55'35.34\"E) was chosen for continuous observations from 11:00 to 24:00 on Mar. 14, with the incidence 20°-70° and the step length 5°. \n     The rape stubble land (38°15'23.17\"N, 100°58'37.84\"E) was chosen for continuous observations from 10:00 to 21:30 on Mar. 16, with the incidence 20°-70° and the step length 5°. \n     The deep plowed land (38°18'8.28\"N, 101° 3'27.22\"E) was chosen for short time observations from 17:26 to 19:20 on Mar. 17, with the azimuth angle 240°-300° and the step length 10°, the incidence 40°-70° and the step length 5°. \n     The brightness temperature was archived as .BRT and .txt files (the ASCII format). Each row in .txt was listed by year, month, date, hour, minute, second, 6.925GHz (h), 6.925GHz (v), 10.65GHz (h), 10.65GHz (v) , 18.7GHz (h), 18.7GHz (v), 36.5GHz (h), 36.5GHz (v), the elevation angle, and the azimuth angle. Values for 6.925GHz and 10.65GHz were zero due to malfunction.\n     The roughness data were obtained by the grid board and the camera and the RMS height (cm) and correlation length (cm) were also calculated and archived, which could be opened by Notepad or Microsoft Office Word. Those provide reliable reference for the roughness of the same land cover type.\n     The gravimetric soil moisture (soil samples from 0-1cm, 1-3cm and 3-5cm) was measured by the microwave drying method. The file can be opened by Microsoft Office Word.\n     The shallow layer soil moisture was measured by hydra prob from 12:00 to 17:00 on 14 and by the Hydra probe (straight downward for 0-5cm) and HH2 (level into the soil surface) on 16. The surface temperature was measured by the thermal resistor. The file can be opened by Microsoft Office Word.\n     Four data files were included, the brightness temperature, the surface temperature, the soil moisture and the surface roughness.",

This data represents the microwave radiative characteristics of the surface at various incidence angles.",

                    "Answer": "The microwave oven drying method involves collecting soil samples from specific depths (0-1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm), drying them in a microwave, and calculating the soil's gravimetric water content. This method provides precise moisture content relevant to the sample depth but can be time-consuming due to sample collection and processing. In contrast, TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) provides a quicker, non-destructive means of measuring soil moisture in situ. On March 14 and 16, TDR was used to measure surface moisture with Hydra Probes and HH2, where the Hydra Probe was inserted vertically, offering direct readings for the top 0-5cm layer. This method is efficient for capturing temporal variability but may have measurement discrepancies, especially with HH2, due to environmental factors such as air exposure during horizontal insertion.",

                    "Answer": "Accurate measurement of soil moisture content using microwave radiometry can be challenging due to various factors including the need to account for different surface types such as wheat stubble and deep-plowed fields, the angle of incidence, and the potential interference from environmental variables like surface roughness and atmospheric conditions. The data collection method involves using a truck-mounted microwave radiometer to measure radiative brightness temperatures at specific frequencies, while soil moisture is also assessed using a microwave oven drying method and TDR devices, which can have varying accuracy based on the surface conditions and measurement techniques.",

                    "Answer": "Soil moisture content is measured using multiple methods, including the drying method with a microwave oven for soil samples taken at different depths (0-1cm, 1-3cm, 3-5cm), and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) with instruments like the hydra probe and HH2. The hydra probe is inserted vertically to measure the surface 0-5cm moisture content, while the HH2 is inserted horizontally, potentially leading to lower measurements due to air exposure.",
