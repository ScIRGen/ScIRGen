            "description": "The drought index used in the development of this dataset is based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), where precipitation data comes from the multi-source fusion of the China Meteorological forcing dataset (CMFD). The data file calculates SPI for four commonly used time scales: monthly SPI (SPI01), 3-month SPI (SPI03), 6-month SPI (SPI06), and 12-month SPI (SPI12). The time resolution is monthly, and the horizontal spatial resolution is 0.1 °. The calculation method of standardized precipitation index at different time scales refers to the national standard of the People's Republic of China \"Meteorological Drought Grades\" (GB/T 20481-2017). This data mainly provides support for studying climate change, especially drought change, on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

In this context, it is calculated using precipitation data from a multi-source fused dataset, specifically the China meteorological forcing dataset (CMFD), to assess drought conditions in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The SPI is computed for four common time scales: monthly (SPI01), 3-month (SPI03), 6-month (SPI06), and 12-month (SPI12) intervals, with a temporal resolution of one month and a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees.
