            "description": "The data product of ice flow velocity field of Rayner Glacier in East Antarctica in 1963 based on ARGON historical remote sensing images. Using two declassified satellite images taken in 1963 with an interval of two months, the early ice flow velocity field of the Reina Glacier in eastern Antarctica is estimated by hierarchical matching based on parallax decomposition. The accuracy of the estimated velocity map can reach 70 m/year. A method for estimating the surface velocity of cooperative glaciers based on the parallax decomposition of optical stereo images. First, the image to be matched generates the core image and the pyramid of the core image; Next, the ice flow area mask is used to divide the image into ice flow area and non ice flow area for matching respectively. In addition to the normal matching steps, the ice flow area also needs to perform parallax demarcation to distinguish the impact of ice flow movement on terrain parallax. Finally, through layer by layer matching, we can get the DTM and ice flow diagram of the object side at the bottom. This data is of great significance for reconstructing the early surface morphology and ice flow velocity of Rayner Glacier in East Antarctica.",

                "Environmental issues resulting from global climate change can considerably influence human society and natural environments. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report (IPCC, 2013), it is highly probable that the increased warming and sustained mass loss of glaciers and ice sheets would further accelerate the rate of global sea level rise. Numerous studies have been performed to investigate the change of the ice sheets, the mechanism of their interaction with the ocean and responses to global climate change. Although some early data collected by in situ measurements in the 1950s or even earlier are available, they only cover regions of a limited scale and cannot be used to support change analysis of ice sheets on a large scale. Fortunately, a remarkable data source, namely, Declassified Intelligence Satellite Photography (known as DISP), collected by a series of film-based reconnaissance satellites (KH series), including ARGON, CORONA, and LANYARD, has been made available. DISP provides a unique opportunity to research early ice sheet configurations, thus greatly extending the time period of the Antarctic surface observations. Geometric processing is required as a critical procedure to utilize these historical scanned satellite films for further scientific applications. Nonetheless, the handling of these film-based data presents a variety of challenges, such as the imperfections of the early imaging mechanisms, artifacts of the films, deformation through long-period storage, and others. Numerous related studies have managed to retrieve the image geometry of historical scanned films with the aid of additional GCPs, but it is not easy to perform the processing steps in Polar Regions where the ground control is difficult to access. Only three ARGON satellite missions (mission numbers 9034A, 9058A, and 9059A) captured the scenes of Antarctica in the 1960s. Most of the studies employed ARGON imagery by registering to other more recent data using GCPs. However, the geometric reconstruction involved was usually not extensively discussed, nor were the various distortions existing in the film-based images."

Moreover, the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA) (15 m resolution) and the ASTER GDEM ver 2 were employed as the reference data to assist in the selection of GCPs and Check Points (CP) so as to validate the accuracy of the geometric modeling and DEM product generated by the ARGON images."
