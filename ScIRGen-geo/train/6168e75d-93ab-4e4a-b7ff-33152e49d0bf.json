It is generated from the big data (e.g., ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations) using artificial intelligence by considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of air pollution. This is the big data-derived seamless (spatial coverage = 100%) daily, monthly, and yearly 1 km (i.e., D1K, M1K, and Y1K) ground-level PM2.5 dataset in China from 2000 to present. This dataset yields a high quality with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.92 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 10.76 µg m-3 on a daily basis. Note that this dataset is continuously updated, and if you want to apply for more data or have any questions, please contact me (Email: weijing_rs@163.com; weijing@umd.edu).\nThe data file contains four codes (Python, Matlab, IDL and R language) nc2geotiff codes for NC to GeoTiff.",

                "Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can significantly harm human health and increase the risk of death. Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. In 2016, more than 92% of the world’s population lived in areas experiencing pollution levels exceeding national acceptable limits. Air pollution has become one of the major environmental risks affecting human health and can raise the risk of death, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. About three million deaths per year are related to exposure to outdoor air pollution. In particular, fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) has become the fifth leading lethal risk around the world. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 has resulted in 4.2 million deaths, accounting for 7.6% of deaths in 2015 globally and 59% of deaths in eastern and southern Asia, especially China. Since the start of the twentieth century, the Chinese government has implemented a large number of policies to both promote the national economy and improve air quality. Over the years, remote sensing technology has been widely applied in estimating spatially continuous near-surface PM2.5 concentrations. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) products generated from multi-source satellites, e.g., the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), and Himawari-8, have been employed as the most critical independent variable to derive PM2.5 concentrations due to their strongly positive relationships."

                "For this purpose, our proposed tree-based ensemble Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model is adopted here to retrieve PM2.5 concentrations. The 1 km MODIS Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product (MCD19A2), newly released in May 2018, is used in this study. Ancillary information on meteorological variables, land use, pollutant emissions, and population are involved in the model to improve PM2.5-AOD relationships. Based on this, we produce for the first time a high-resolution and high-quality PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., China-HighPM2.5), reconstructing the period from 2000 to 2018. We also perform a comprehensive investigation of spatiotemporal PM2.5 variations across China."

In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions combating air pollution in China. While nationwide PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by 0.89 μg/m3/yr (p < 0.001) during the last two decades, the reduction has accelerated to 4.08 μg/m3/yr (p < 0.001) over the last six years, indicating a significant improvement in air quality. Large improvements occurred in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas, while the most polluted region remained the North China Plain, especially in winter."
