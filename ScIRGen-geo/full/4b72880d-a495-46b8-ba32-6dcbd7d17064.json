            "description": "On 29 June 2012, CASI sensor carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a visible near Infrared hyperspectral airborne remote sensing experiment, which is located in the observation experimental area (30×30 km). The land cover pattern product in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin were obtained at a spatial resolution of 1 m, using CASI aerial data with high spatial and spectral resolution．A hierarchical classification structure integrated by pixel-based classification and object-based classification is used to obtain production．According to surveyed reference data about land cover and visual interpretation from high resolution imagery，the accuracy of the classification result of land cover was evaluated，and the result showed that overall accuracy was 84.61 %，Kappa coefficient was 0.8262．",

Changes in land cover can lead to global changes by impacting ecosystems, and its effects on the environment are at least as significant as those caused by climate change. Additionally, land cover is a key biophysical parameter that determines the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems in biogeochemical cycles, hydrological processes, and surface-atmosphere interactions. It is also one of the critical factors that must be considered in land use and land management decisions. Accurate land cover information can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of ecological and hydrological models in heterogeneous regions."

We performed radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and geometric correction on the original CASI data. First, based on the field calibration spectral data provided by HIWATER and the corresponding CE-318 atmospheric parameter data, we calculated the CASI calibration coefficients to obtain the sensor's entrance pupil radiance. Then, we used the FLAASH atmospheric correction model to invert the radiance to surface reflectance. Finally, combining the airborne POS data with the DEM data of the Zhangye area, we used the airborne data preprocessing software ProcManager developed by ITRES Canada to perform geometric correction on the reflectance data."

LSE reflecting the land surface emission feature is widely applied in geological research, mineral mapping and so on. Quantitative remote sensing inversion is an important approach to retrieve LST&E on regional and global scale. As the multi-spectral and hyperspectral thermal infrared sensors appear, deriving the LST&E simultaneously becomes possible. Except for the space-borne sensors such as MODIS and ASTER, various airborne multispectral and hyperspectral thermal infrared sensors play important role on regional survey and scientific research for their flexibility and finer spatial resolution. At the same time, algorithms for extracting LST/LSE information from the data collected by these airborne sensors have been subsequently proposed and yielded satisfactory result. However, the emissivity validation using in situ data has been barely presented. TASI is a new generation of commercial hyperspectral infrared sensors released by ITRES, Canada in 2006, aiming to the detection of land surface temperature and emission characteristics and applications like mineral mapping, land mining and gas exploration."
