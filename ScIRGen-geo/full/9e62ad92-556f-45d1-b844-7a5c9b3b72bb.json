            "description": "At Alengchu, conodont fauna from the Silurian-Devonian transitional interval in Lijiang city, Yunnan (GPS coordinates: 100°31′12.08″E, 27°15′47.56″N) are reported in detail during this study. Lower parts (Bed 9 to Bed 13) of the Shanjiang Formation yield conodonts of great stratigraphic significance, which enable to test the application of established subdivision schemes from peri-Gondwana. The conodont fauna is assignable to 12 taxa belonging to eight genera (Ancyrodelloides, Flajsella, Lanea, Wurmiella, Zieglerodina, Caudicriodus, Pelekysgnathus, and Pseudooneotodus), and two chronostratigraphical intervals could be recognized from the lower part of the Shanjiang Formation. The interval ranging from the uppermost part of Bed 9 to the upper part of Bed 10 belongs to the lower Lochkovian; whereas an interval covering the uppermost part of Bed 11 to the upper part of Bed 13 is correlated with the upper half of the middle Lochkovian. The Silurian-Devonian boundary is probably located within Bed 9, in the basal part of the Shanjiang Formation. However, the scarcity of specimens precludes definitive identification of bases of the lower, middle, and upper Lochkovian as well as other conodont zones recognized in peri-Gondwana. The conodont fauna has great significance for biostratigraphy subdivision ad correlation around the Silurian-Devonian boundary. This dataset include identification lists from the Alengchu section.",

                    "Answer": "The identified conodont species and their stratigraphic distribution suggest that biostratigraphic sequences along the Gondwana periphery can be validated using the conodont assemblages from the Shanjiang Formation. The presence of 12 species across 8 genera allows for the division of the formation into two chronostratigraphic units, reflecting the Lower and Middle Lochkovian stages. This biostratigraphic information could guide future data collection methods by prioritizing the acquisition of standard conodont species to accurately delineate stratigraphic boundaries, thus refining datasets used for comparative studies in paleontology.",

                    "Answer": "The accurate identification of the boundaries of the Lower, Middle, and Upper Lochkovian stages in stratigraphic profiles, such as those found in the Alengchu section, is challenging due to the reliance on standard conodont elements, which are not always readily available or clearly defined in the existing profiles. This necessitates further acquisition of standard conodont elements to improve accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "Identifying additional standard conodont elements could improve the accuracy of biostratigraphic sequences by providing clearer delineation of stratigraphic boundaries, such as those within the Lochkovian stages, and enabling better correlation with Gondwana margin regions. This could facilitate more precise geological dating and enhance the understanding of sedimentary sequences in the field.",

This identification can help delineate stratigraphic units and improve the accuracy of geological timelines, especially in recognizing boundary layers and correlating them across different geographic locations.",
