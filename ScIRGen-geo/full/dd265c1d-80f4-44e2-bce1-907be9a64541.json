            "description": "Hoh Xil area is located in the hinterland of Qinghai Tibet Plateau, south of Kunlun Mountain, north of Tanggula Mountain and west of Qinghai Tibet highway. From May to August 1990, the comprehensive scientific investigation team of Kekexili region, jointly organized by the State Science and Technology Commission, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Qinghai provincial government and the State Environmental Protection Bureau, with the strong support of the Qinghai provincial government, carried out a large-scale comprehensive investigation in the region and obtained rich first-hand precious information. Biologists all over the world have realized more and more clearly that the most urgent task at present is to conduct a comprehensive investigation of some species before they are stable or extinct in the natural ecosystem, and the investigation of species diversity is the most critical, because if we do not correctly understand the species in a certain area and their role in the natural ecosystem, it will be seriously damaged Affect the development of other work. Most of the Hoh Xil area in Qinghai Province is still a no man's land. There is almost no investigation and Research on the biodiversity and resources in this area. Therefore, this scientific research is of great scientific significance.",
            "instructions": "The data set is stored in Excel format and contains 9 workbooks, which are 1. Species diversity and geographical distribution of mammals in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai 2. Faunal composition of mammals in Hoh Xil area of Qinghai 3. Comparison of faunal composition characteristics between Hoh Xil area and surrounding areas 4.

The number statistics of the main species of the three natural ecosystems. 8. The comparison of the species diversity and evenness of different ecosystems. 9. The geographical distribution of mammals in Kekexili area of Qinghai Province. The table introduces the detailed distribution of Kekexili Mammal composition, geographical distribution, characteristic comparison, distribution list, similarity value and other precious data in Dali area.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of data collection in remote regions like the Qinghai Hoh Xil area, 'comprehensive scientific expedition' refers to a large-scale, thorough investigation carried out by a team of researchers from various institutions, aimed at gathering extensive and valuable first-hand information about the biodiversity and ecological conditions of a largely unexplored region. This involves systematic surveys and assessments of species diversity and their roles in the ecosystem, which are crucial for understanding and managing biodiversity.",

                    "Answer": "The survey was driven by the need to conduct a thorough investigation of species before any potential extinction or ecological imbalance occurs. The Qinghai Kekexili region was mostly uncharted in terms of its biodiversity and resource status, making this survey crucial for understanding the species and their roles within the natural ecosystem. The importance of documenting species diversity was recognized as critical for further ecological research and environmental conservation efforts.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goal of conducting comprehensive biodiversity surveys in the Qinghai Kekexili region is to obtain detailed baseline data on species diversity and their roles within natural ecosystems before they become unstable or extinct. This information is crucial for understanding the region's biodiversity and resource status, which is largely unknown due to the area's remoteness and lack of prior research. Such surveys can significantly influence future research and conservation efforts by providing essential data needed to assess and protect the biodiversity of this unique and largely unexplored area.",

The survey was also supported by the logistical and infrastructural support provided by the Qinghai Provincial Government, allowing researchers to conduct extensive fieldwork in this largely uninhabited region.",
