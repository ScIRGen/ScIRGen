Because of a lack of detailed open ground lift data along the coastal area of China, through a systematic literature review, we got the lifting of the surface of China's coastal regions in detail and established China's coastal cities land subsidence database, including China's coastal cities sedimentation rate in the different periods and measurements. The literature mainly comes from CNKI database, Web of Science, and the grey literature, such as reporting, planning, etc. The data can be used in the study of relative sea level change, coastal extreme water level and coastal flooding risk research, and can provide the reference and basis for adaptation measures for coastal land subsidence prevention and control and planning, etc. ",

                "Land subsidence is impacting large populations in coastal Asia via relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Coastal areas are threatened by increased flooding during the 21st century and beyond due to climate-induced sea-level rise (SLR). However, the impact of human-induced subsidence and its effect on relative sea-level rise (RSLR) at broad scales has been less assessed. RSLR comprises the sum of climate-driven SLR, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), tectonic vertical land movements, natural subsidence due to consolidation and human-induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal, drainage and other causes. A number of important coastal cities built completely or partly on deltaic deposits, such as New Orleans, Bangkok, Jakarta, Shanghai and Tokyo, have already experienced several meters of human-induced subsidence through the 20th/early 21st century. Hence, subsidence is a process with major consequences for flood risk and adaptation requirements in coastal areas. South, south-east and east Asia are especially prone to these issues, reflecting the dense coastal population and high subsidence potential of deltas and alluvial plains around these coasts. The mechanisms of land subsidence are complex, resulting from a multitude of natural processes (e.g. natural compaction) and anthropogenic processes (e.g. underground fluid withdrawal). Anthropogenic causes have the potential to greatly accelerate natural subsidence processes to rates often exceeding 1 cm/yr, with more than 10 cm/yr locally observed in Jakarta, Indonesia. Reducing human-induced subsidence (henceforth termed subsidence control) by removing its causes, such as reducing or stopping groundwater withdrawal, has been successfully implemented in several coastal cities, most notably Tokyo. China has the largest coastal population in the world and a high subsidence potential along much of its coast due to the presence of many deltas and alluvial plains. Subsidence now affects more than eight percent of China’s land area (or 790,000 km2), with average cumulative land subsidence of more than 20 cm (in 2009)."

                "From 2015 to 2050, we also analysed RSLR assumptions considering three RCP-derived climate-induced SLR scenarios and assuming the other four components remaining constant using length-weighted averaging (Supplementary Fig. 4). Considering all the RSLR components, including uncontrolled high city subsidence, RSLR is significantly higher (Supplementary Fig. 4), with a range from 17 to 40 cm in 2050, with a mean RSLR rate of 8.8 mm/yr between 2015 and 2050. This is 73% higher than climate-induced SLR alone. If city subsidence is controlled, the RSLR range in 2050 is 10–26 cm with a rate of 4.8 mm/yr, which is similar to the climate-only assumption due to the offsetting effects of GIA and tectonics, which are causing uplift. Subsidence control measures can be effective, in theory, if implemented quickly. By 2050, under climate-induced SLR only (Assumption 1), 53,190 km2 of land, 35 million people and US$ 5,263 billion of assets are exposed to the 100-year coastal flood event (Supplementary Table 4). With all RSLR components, including uncontrolled city subsidence (Assumptions 4 and 5), the 100-year coastal floodplain will expand to 64,000–74,000 km2 in 2050 (an increase of 20–39%). Subsidence control (Assumption 6) is an effective response to reduce growth in exposure to coastal flooding: the increase compared to the climate-induced SLR only assumption is only 7% for exposed land, 6% for exposed population and 7% for exposed assets, respectively."

This subsidence contributes to relative sea-level rise (RSLR) by adding to climate-induced sea-level rise, leading to increased flood risk and impacting adaptation requirements in coastal areas.",

In the context of data collection for coastal subsidence databases, grey literature is used alongside sources like CNKI literature database and Web of Science to compile comprehensive data on land subsidence, providing valuable information that may not be available in traditional academic publications.",

Comprehensive assessments will require more detailed and updated data to refine predictions and effectively plan for adaptation strategies.",
