            "description": "This data set includes whole rock major and trace element geochemical data, whole rock Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data and whole rock Ar-Ar isotopic data of basalt in Langshan area, Inner Mongolia. The major element geochemical data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF test, and the trace element geochemical data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis. The whole rock Sr-Nd isotopic data were obtained by Finnigan Triton TIMS analysis, and the whole rock Pb isotopic data were obtained by multi collector Finnigan MAT-262 mass spectrometer analysis. The whole rock Ar-Ar isotopic data were obtained in two steps. First, the data were preprocessed in Beijing fast neutron reactor, and then tested and analyzed by Argus VI noble gas mass spectrometer in the Key Laboratory of Tectonics and Petroleum Resources Ministry of Education, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). The above data have been published in the international authoritative geological journal Chemical Geology, and the data are authentic. This set of data can effectively constrain the material circulation in the mantle source area of Langshan basalt.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of analytical techniques such as XRF, ICP-MS, TIMS, and Ar-Ar isotopic analysis is driven by their ability to accurately measure different geochemical properties of the basalt samples. XRF is used for major element geochemistry due to its precision and efficiency. ICP-MS is chosen for trace element analysis because of its sensitivity and capability to detect low concentrations. TIMS is utilized for Sr-Nd isotopic data to provide precise isotopic ratios necessary for geochemical studies. Ar-Ar isotopic analysis is selected to date geological events, benefiting from the precision of the Argus VI noble gas mass spectrometer. These methods together offer a comprehensive understanding of the mantle source material cycling in the Langshan basalt region.",
