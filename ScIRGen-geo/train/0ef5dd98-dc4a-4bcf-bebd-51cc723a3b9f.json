X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) was used to test the major elements with an accuracy of less than 2%, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to test the trace elements with an accuracy of less than 5%, and multi-channel inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) was used to test the stable isotopes of Ca, Mg and Fe with an accuracy of more than 0.06 ‰. The above tests were completed from May 14, 2016 to June 19, 2020, The data have been published in many international well-known petrological journals, such as geochimica et cosmochimica Acta, chemical geology, etc. These data are of great significance for understanding the fractionation behavior of metal stable isotopes in magmatic rock systems.",

Our current knowledge on Fe isotope fractionation during crustal melting remains rare. High silica (e.g., SiO2 N 71 wt%) granitic rocks have a highly variable δ56Fe from−0.04‰ to 0.46‰, which has been previously explained by isotope fractionation due to fluid exsolution, fractional crystallization, crustal melting, source heterogeneity and/or diffusion. Migmatites are a mixture of metamorphic rock and igneous rock. They form via incipient partial melting in pre-existing gneisses, which is often induced by the breakdown of hydrous minerals (e.g., biotite) or influx of fluid. Produced partial melts that are siliceous and hence not able to escape re-crystallize to form the igneous part of migmatites, which are generally quartz and feldspar rich and thus light-colored and called leucosomes. The residual part of migmatites are usually rich in dark-colored amphibole and biotite and called the melanosomes."

The leucosomes measured here have Fe3+/ΣFe ratios comparable to their coexisting menalosomes. Fe isotope fractionation during crustal anatexis revealed here thus is not dominantly controlled by distribution of Fe3+ and Fe2+ between the melts and their residua.

                "Significant iron (Fe) isotope fractionation (e.g., d56Fe > 0.5 ‰, ten times larger than the analytical uncertainty) has been observed in terrestrial igneous rocks (e.g., Weyer and Ionov, 2007; Teng et al., 2008; Dauphas et al., 2009a; Williams and Bizimis, 2014; He et al., 2015b ). It remains unclear to what extent these variations reflect magma processes or source composition (e.g., oxidation state, mineralogy, and compositions) (e.g., Dauphas et al., 2014; Williams and Bizimis, 2014; Zambardi et al., 2014; Foden et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015a ); in particular, whether Fe isotopes can help reveal redox conditions of planetary and igneous processes (Dauphas et al., 2014; Williams and Bizimis, 2014) or whether additional factors, such as coordination environment, play a significant role (Sossi and O’Neill, 2017). Fe has two oxidation states (ferrous Fe2+ and ferric Fe3+) in terrestrial silicate phases. The mean force constant of Fe3+ bearing bonds is higher than that of Fe2+ bearing bonds in silicate glasses, which predicts an enrichment of heavy isotopes in the former and highlights the potential of Fe isotopes as a tracer of magma redox conditions (Dauphas et al., 2014). However, predicted isotope fractionation induced by the distribution of Fe3+ and Fe2+ during partial melting of mantle peridotite can only account for one-third of the observed difference between middle ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and the upper mantle (/C24 0.1‰ on d56Fe; Teng et al., 2013; Dauphas et al., 2014). In addition to the distribution of Fe3+ and Fe2+, the difference in the coordination environment of Fe is a complementary but independent mechanism of Fe isotope fractionation (Sossi and O’Neill, 2017). Among Fe2+-enriched silicate minerals, garnet with Fe2+ in VIII-coordination has a Fe isotopic composition substantially lower than coexisting olivine and pyroxenes, in which Fe2+ is mainly in VI-coordination (e.g., D56Fegarnet-cpx in eclogites down to /C0 0.42‰ and on average /C24/C0 0.26‰; Beard and Johnson, 2004; Williams et al., 2009). Accordingly, Fe isotope fractionation during partial melting might be also controlled by source mineralogy. Partial melting of garnet-rich sources (e.g., pyroxenite and recycled eclogite) may produce Fe isotope fractionation larger than peridotite melting and contribute to the high d56Fe end-member of ocean island basalts (Williams and Bizimis, 2014; Sossi and O’Neill, 2017). However, the relative importance of redox and coordination environment is complicated by source heterogeneity and Fe isotope fractionation during magma differentiation (Teng et al., 2008; Williams and Bizimis, 2014; Foden et al., 2015; Sossi and O’Neill, 2017). Observations serving as evidence to constrain to what extent source mineralogy can affect Fe isotope fractionation during partial melting, however, remain scarce. Adakitic rocks may help to provide these constraints, as they are derived by partial melting of eclogitic rocks with variably abundant residual garnet (Defant and Drummond, 1990; Rapp and Watson, 1995; He et al., 2011), and thus may provide a test on the role of source mineralogy in fractionating Fe isotopes during partial melting processes."

Thirteen non-adakitic granitoid samples from the Dabie orogen, with SiO2 spanning from 56 to 77 wt.%, are also measured to better understand Fe isotope fractionation during differentiation of intermediate and felsic magmas and to constrain the extent of magma compositional control."

Approximately 5–20 mg whole rock powders were dissolved in Teflon beakers in a mixture of HF-HNO3-HClO4, and then refluxed with aqua regia (HCl: HNO3 = 3:1) and excess HNO3 aqua regia (HCl: HNO3 = 2:1) successively at 130 /C176C. The solutions were subsequently evaporated to dryness at 100 /C176C. Finally, residues were dissolved in 6 N HCl for chromatographic purification. Iron was separated from matrix elements and potential isobars with AG1X-8 resin (200–400 mesh) in a HCl medium. Whole procedure blank is 610 ng and can be considered negligible, considering P100 lg sample Fe was processed. Isotopic ratios were analyzed by the sample-standard bracketing method using a Thermo-Finnigan Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS on high resolution modes. The isotopic measurement sequence was repeated nine times for each sample Fe solution to get better accuracy, and the data are reported in the traditional d values relative to IRMM-014 (diFe = [(iFe/54Fe)sample/(iFe/54-Fe)IRMM-014 /C0 1] /C2 1000, where i can be 56 or 57). Two standard errors of the mean are reported after Dauphas et al. (2009b) and He et al. (2015a), with consideration of those arising both from chemical procedures and from the MC-ICPMS measurement.

Modelling suggests that Mg isotope fractionation factor between the melt and clinopyroxene (Δ26Mgmelt-cpx) is limited to be around −0.02‰. Compared to highly variable δ26Mg (−5.57‰ to +0.92‰) of supracrustal materials, isotope fractionation during partial melting of basaltic sources is either insignificant (< 0.14‰) in a thickened crust scenario or can be easily erased by melt-mantle interaction in a slab melting scenario.
