            "titleEn": "Early Oligocene plant functional types of southeastern Tibetan Plateau inferred from palynology",
            "description": "This dataset is derived from the paper: Tang, H. et al. (2020). Early Oligocene vegetation and climate of southwestern China inferred from palynology. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 560, 109988. doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109988\nThis data is part of Supplementary data of the paper, maily contains: Supplementary table 1) Pollen percentages, which were calculated using the collected pollen samples. Supplementary table 2) Plant functional types (PFTs) for the reconstructed paleovegetation of three sites : Wenshan (Early Oligocene), Jianchuan (Early Oligocene) and Lühe (Late Eocene).\nRecently, in the town of Lühe, central Yunnan, SW China, a new fossil-bearing section was found and dated as early Oligocene (~33–32 Ma) according to U-Pb isotope of volcanic tuff. The fossil-bearing section totals about 18 m in thickness. Fifty-five pollen samples were collected vertically throughout this Lühe town section. For each sample, 2–2.5 g of sediment were treated with KOH (10%,) HCl (10%) and HF (39%), then sample residues were sieved through a 5 μm nylon mesh in an ultrasonic tank. Spore and pollen grains were identified using both a light microscope (LM, Leica DM1000 microscope) and a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Single grains were picked up by a capillary tube and then transferred to a copper stub, coated with gold and observed with a Zeiss EVO LS10 SEM. At least 300 pollen grains were counted for each sample under the LM at ×400 magnification. Then the pollen percentages were calculated using the sum of total terrestrial pollen.\nThe paleovegetation was reconstructed following the method described by Prentice et al., 1996, Prentice and Jolly, 2000 and Ni et al. (2010). The paleobiomes were reconstructed by comparing the similarity of the palaeoflora with modern plant functional types (PFTs), according to the data published by Ni et al. (2010). The similarity between the palaeoflora and modern PFTs data was explored using Euclidean distances (Prentice et al., 1996) and the Jaccard Index Coefficient (Pound and Salzmann, 2017). The Jaccard Index Coefficient in the R package “clusteval” was used here to calculate the similarity. The palaeoflora was assigned to the biome with the highest similarity scores, taking into account dominant or key taxa.",

                    "Answer": "The choice of methods for reconstructing ancient vegetation from pollen and spore samples in palynological studies is influenced by the availability of precise dating techniques, such as uranium-lead isotopic dating, the quality and quantity of pollen and spore samples, and the need to accurately identify and quantify different pollen types using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the reconstruction is guided by the methodology of comparing ancient plant assemblages with modern plant functional types using Euclidean distance and Jaccard index coefficient to assess similarity.",

                    "Answer": "The reconstruction of early Oligocene vegetation and climate using palynology data from the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau aims to understand the historical vegetation dynamics and climatic conditions of the region. By analyzing pollen samples from this period, researchers can infer the types of vegetation that existed and their functional types, which in turn provides insights into past climate conditions. This information is crucial for understanding the ecological and environmental changes over geological time scales and how they relate to current climate patterns.",

Spore and pollen identification was conducted using both optical and scanning electron microscopy. Single pollen grains were collected with a capillary, transferred to a copper sample stage, gold-coated, and observed under a Zeiss EVO LS10 scanning electron microscope. Pollen counting was performed at 400x magnification, with at least 300 grains counted per sample. Different pollen group percentages were then calculated for analysis.",
