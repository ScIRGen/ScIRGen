            "description": "The wind-induced undercatch bring about bias in gauge measurement of in-situ precipitation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Referring to the observation of precipitation phases and amount by the OTT Parsivel2 disdrometer at the Wudaoliang and Tanggula sites, firstly, the scheme for precipitation phases partitioning was constructed according to the thresholds of dewpoint temperatures. Secondly, the daily precipitation adjustment scheme for different precipitation phases is proposed by constructing the quantitative relationship between wind speed and observed precipitation under different precipitation patterns. Finally, the proposed adjustment scheme is applied to the daily precipitation observation data of 78 meteorological stations on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The unadjusted daily precipitation is obtained from the National Weather Science Data Center (http://data.cma.cn/). This dataset contains a date column (TIMESTAMP) and three indicators: the adjusted daily precipitation phases (rain_type), catch ratio rate (CR), and adjusted precipitation (pre_adj). The daily precipitation phases are divided into three types: rain, sleet, and snow (corresponding to values 1-3). Daily precipitation catch ratio has four decimal places; The unit of daily precipitation is millimeter, rounded to one decimal place. The data is from January 1, 1981 to December 31.",

                    "Answer": "The goal of correcting daily precipitation data for wind-induced dynamic losses is to address observation biases in precipitation measurements, which can occur due to variations in wind speed and precipitation forms. By developing correction schemes based on the quantitative relationship between wind speed and observed precipitation under different forms, the objective is to improve the accuracy of daily precipitation data collected from meteorological stations across the Tibetan Plateau. This correction ensures that the data better reflects actual precipitation levels, which is crucial for accurate climate analysis and hydrological studies in this region.",
