            "description": "The data are the major and trace element data, zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, zircon Lu Hf isotopic data, and whole rock SR Nd isotopic data of the balazha ore bearing porphyry adakitic rock and granite in the Northern Lhasa plate, Tibet. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Through the data, we can understand the regional tectonic background, and provide evidence for the genesis, source and tectonic background of magmatic rocks in Lhasa block.",

                    "Answer": "XRF (X-ray fluorescence) is significant for obtaining major element data in geochemical analysis due to its ability to accurately measure and quantify the concentration of elements in whole rock samples. ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) is used to obtain trace element data because of its high sensitivity and precision in detecting low concentrations of elements. Together, these methods provide comprehensive geochemical profiles necessary for understanding the composition and source of igneous rocks in the context of porphyry copper deposits like the ones in the northern Lhasa terrane.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy and reliability of isotopic dating and elemental analysis in the geochemical study of adakitic rocks and granites can be influenced by several factors such as the precision of XRF and ICP-MS techniques used for major and trace element data, the calibration and setup of LA-MC-ICP-MS instruments for zircon U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic compositions, as well as the sample preparation methods. Additionally, the geological complexity and heterogeneity of the rock samples from the northern Lhasa terrane can also contribute to potential challenges in data accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "For collecting and analyzing geochemical and isotopic data from porphyry copper deposits in the northern Lhasa terrane, several instrumental and procedural methods are employed. The main element data of whole rocks are obtained using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, while trace element data are collected using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu-Hf isotopic data are acquired using laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). Furthermore, whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic data are also collected. These methods provide reliable data that help understand the regional tectonic background and offer evidence for the origin, source, and tectonic setting of magmatic rocks in the Lhasa terrane.",
