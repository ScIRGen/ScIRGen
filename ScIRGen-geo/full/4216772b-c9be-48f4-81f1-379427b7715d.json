            "description": "The western and northeastern Yunnan is located in the southeast of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Previous genetic studies have shown that there are substantial genetic imprints of late Paleolithic human in this region, and these ancient genetic imprints are likely to spread further to the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Therefore, the genetic study of the population in this area is helpful to clarify the migration history of early human settlement in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. In this study, we studied the genetics of Dai people in different areas of Yunnan Province. The mitochondrial DNA hypervariable regions of 264 Dai individuals were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we control the quality of these data to ensure that there is no sample contamination and other quality problems. According to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence, the variants were recorded. According to the phylogenetic tree of mitochondrial DNA in the world population (PhyloTree.org), each sample was allocated into certain haplogrop. Based on the published mtDNA data of Dai people in other areas, the maternal genetic structure and formation mechanism of Dai population were systematically studied. The results showed that there was a close genetic relationship among the Dai populations in different regions, and the haplogroups (F1a, M7B and B5a) shared by these populations could be traced back to southern China, suggesting that the Dai population might have originated in southern China and migrated southward to the mainland and Southeast Asia in the Iron or Bronze age. The genetic differentiation of the Dai population in different regions is consistent with the phenomenon that their language and culture have some differences, which indicates that the Dai people and the surrounding populations in the southward migration.",

                    "Answer": "The choice to use Sanger sequencing for mitochondrial DNA hypervariable region analysis in population genetics studies is likely influenced by the need for high accuracy in sequencing to ensure quality control and avoid sample contamination. This method allows for precise identification of mutation sites and haplogroup classification, which is crucial for understanding the genetic structure and migration history of populations, such as those on the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, using a well-established reference like the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence aids in generating comparable and reliable data across studies.",

                    "Answer": "Using Sanger sequencing for mitochondrial DNA analysis allows for the detailed examination of genetic imprints from the Paleolithic era. This method facilitates the identification of specific haplogroups within the mitochondrial genome, which can trace back ancient human migration patterns and provide evidence of genetic continuity or divergence over time. By applying rigorous quality control measures, Sanger sequencing ensures the reliability of results and helps in understanding the genetic relationships and evolutionary history of populations in the southeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.",
