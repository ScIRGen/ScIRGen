            "description": "Road noise barriers (rnbs) are important urban infrastructure for building livable cities. However, the lack of large-scale and accurate geospatial data on rnbs hinders the rational urban planning, sustainable urban development and continuous improvement of urban environment. To solve this problem, this study proposes a geospatial artificial intelligence framework, which uses street view images to create vectorized RNB data sets in China. First, the road network of each city is intensively sampled based on OpenStreetMap as a geographical reference for downloading 6 million Baidu street view (BSV) images. In addition, a convolutional neural network containing image background information (ic-cnn) based on integrated learning strategy was also developed to detect RNB from BSV images. Subsequently, based on the identified RNB location, an RNB data set in the form of broken lines is generated, with a total length of 2667.02 kilometers and distributed in 222 cities. Finally, the quality of RNB data set is evaluated from two aspects: one is detection accuracy; Second, integrity and positioning accuracy. Based on a group of randomly selected samples containing 10000 BSV images, four quantitative indexes were calculated: the overall accuracy rate was 98.61%, the recall rate was 87.14%, the accuracy rate was 76.44%, and the F1 score was 81.44%. In addition, BSV images were used to conduct manual surveys on roads with a total length of 254 km in different cities to evaluate the mileage deviation and intersection ratio between the generated and surveyed rnbs: the root mean square error of mileage deviation was 0.08 km, and the intersection ratio was 88.08% ± 2.95%. The evaluation results show that the generated RNB data set is of high quality and can be used as an accurate and reliable data set for various large-scale urban studies.",

                "Roadside noise barriers (RNBs) are a vital urban infrastructure that contribute significantly to mitigate undesirable traffic noise in communities. Additionally, RNBs contribute to the development of sustainable cities in many ways. For example, with the emphasis on new energy, RNBs are being used to install solar photovoltaic panels, thereby increasing the utility of new energy sources. The reasonable presence of RNBs also enables the airflow in the urban canyon region to be adjusted, thereby improving the roadside air quality. Because of the importance of RNBs in building sustainable cities, the demand for RNBs has increased alongside traffic growth in recent decades. Over the past few years, extensive geospatial databases have been established to store data on many aspects of urban infrastructure. However, the sharing and exchange of RNB data in these databases are restricted, and the data only cover a limited geographic area. These challenges to data acquisition are because databases have to adhere to various standards related to geographic data. On the other hand, the RNB data are often created and updated manually through road inspections and investigations which are costly and time-consuming, especially on a large scale. Street view imagery is georeferenced data densely covering the road network of cities. As a new geospatial data source, it provides depictions of real-world surroundings, including natural landscapes and the built environment, and enables users to recognize physical objects, urban dynamics features, and geographic scenes on a large scale. However, manual interpretation is a tedious task, and conventional computer vision algorithms struggle when confronted with large amounts of data and complex image features."
