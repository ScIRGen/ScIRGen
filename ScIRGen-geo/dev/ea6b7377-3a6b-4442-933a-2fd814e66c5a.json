            "description": "The dataset includes human bones and carbon 14th-century data and strontium lead isotope data from Laphok Tomb in Hami Basin, eastern Tianshan Mountains. Age test: Collagen was extracted from human bone samples by chemical pretreatment, graphite was prepared by AGE3 system, and carbon 14 age test was completed by accelerator mass spectrometer. Strontium lead isotope: The sample of human tooth enamel was extracted and collected by physical and chemical means, and the strontium lead isotope test was completed by MC-ICPMS. Human bone carbon 14 dating sample test: oxalate II was added as a modern carbon standard, PHA samples were added to deduct background contamination, IAEA-C7 and IAEA-C8 were added to monitor data accuracy, dating results were calculated using the half-life of carbon 14 of 5568 years, and calendar year correction was performed by IntCal20 curve. Human enamel strontium lead isotope test: About 8 samples were added with a duplicate sample for monitoring data reproducibility. The 2σ error of strontium isotope data was less than 0.000006, and the 2σ error of lead isotope data (206Pb/204Pb) was less than 0.0010. According to the results of isotope studies, the early, middle and late stages of migration can be represented by a three-phase migration model. The highest proportion (54.55%) was made up of non-natives in the early period (around the 7th to mid-7th centuries), although this proportion declined in the middle period (30.77%, mid-7th to mid-8th centuries). After the 10th century, the proportion of non-natives declined again (16.13%).",

                "Mid- to late-Holocene large-scale population migration profoundly impacted the interaction of ethnic groups and cultures across Eurasia, notably in Central Asia. However, due to a lack of thorough historical documents, distinctive burial items, and human remains, the process of population migration during this historical era in the area is still unclear.",
                "Before the 7th century, many Sogdians lived in the Hami Basin as traders from Central Asia, and it was popular for them to use silver and gold coins as funerary objects (Li et al.,1997; Ma, 2015; Wang, 2021). Also, the Turks, Han Chinese, Tubo, and Tuyuhun peoples (from Qinghai-Tibet) resided there throughout that time (Li et al.,1997). It may be inferred that individuals from various geological, political, and cultural backgrounds created a complicated migratory picture in the Hami Basin between the early- and mid-7th century for various reasons by combining isotopic evidence, burial customs, and historical texts. The SPG originated from the Yellow River Basin and was widely distributed throughout the Tang Empire, including the entire Eastern Tianshan region (Chen, 1991; Museum of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,1973; Turpan City Bureau of Cultural Relics et al.,2019). According to historical records, the central government dispatched officials of various levels to control and administer this region ever since the Tang Dynasty founded the Yi Prefecture in Hami in 630 AD (Liu,1975; Ouyang & Song,1975;Yu,2003). The Western States Uighur Kingdom was founded in 866 AD, centering on Turpan and expanding to the east and west, with the entire territory of the eastern Tianshan Mountains under its jurisdiction. Hami was governed by Western Turkistan between the early to mid-7th centuries, while the power of the Central Plains regimes began to gradually permeate the Western Regions (Wei,1973). The Tang Empire's dominance in the western region peaked between the middle of the 7th and 8th centuries. After the second half of the 10th century, several political rival governments ruled over the regions that the Silk Road traveled through. The eastern Xinjiang was under the jurisdiction of the Western States Uighur Kingdom, while the Western Xia government ruled over the Hexi Corridor (Miao & Tian, 2004; Yang & Lu, 1988; Yu, 2003).",
                "Human migration is a movement of individuals or groups of people from one location to another, in which the relocation is either long-term or permanent and requires a crossing of real or conceptual boundaries. A body of methods can be used to assess human migration, including the traditional archeological approaches and a variety of bioarchaeological methods. Notably, one of the underlying assumptions in applying human enamel to establishing a baseline is that most human remains found in a cemetery must be native-born and must have consumed food and water from within or around the site.",
                "The geographic patterns of the cultural and population diversities in the modern world are deeply rooted in large-scale human migrations and cultural interactions since the Neolithic age. More extensive migrations and cultural interactions occurred during the subsequent Eurasian Bronze Age, which helped to facilitate large settlements in Central Asia's arid regions and create pathways for prehistoric transcontinental cultural exchange. The eastern Tianshan Mountains served as a crucial route for the Silk Road's civilizational interchange between the East and West and served as a crucial hub for contact with pastoral and agricultural civilizations. Owing to frequent migration, wars, and regime changes in the eastern Tianshan Mountains, only a few local historical documents persisted. Presently, the established body of knowledge, such as the regime changes, military conflicts, policy contents, and some socioeconomic details, relies heavily on the historical records of the more prominent surrounding civilizations (e.g., Tang Empire and Arab Empire), as well as on archeological finds and research, such as the study of city sites, Buddhist Temples sites, written materials, artifacts, and biological remains. On the basis of this little evidence, it is difficult to create a history of human migration that is as thorough and reliable as that of Central China. The Turpan Basin in the Eastern Tianshan area has the highest concentration of historical archeological finds. The population in the eastern Tianshan region has combined traits of the East and West of Eurasia since the Bronze Age (3000 BC–800 BC), and the impact of eastern Eurasian people steadily grew through time, according to ancient DNA research and craniofacial morphology."

The 87Sr/86Sr and 206Pb/204Pb values of four non-local individuals were either close to or within the local range, indicating that they should have come from the vicinity of Hami or other areas with a similar geological background to the Hami Basin (Figure4).",
                "This work used radiocarbon dating, strontium, and lead isotope measurements on human enamel from the Lafuqueke cemetery to reconstruct the spatiotemporal sequence of human migration in the eastern Tianshan Mountains. In order to reduce the impacts of sample bias, we randomly selected well-preserved teeth that could identify the individual because most human remains in the LFQK cemetery were severely disturbed. The bone collagen was extracted according to the method described by Richards and Hedges (1999), as briefly described below. Eighteen collagen samples were selected for the radiocarbon dating; they were graphitized with Automated Graphitization Equipment (AGE III) and measured by a compact Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (MICADAS) at the Key Laboratory of Western China's Environmental Systems (Ministry of Education), Lanzhou University. Analysis was done on the enamel samples taken from the 56 used remains. Before the isotopic measurement, the tooth samples were cleaned three times employing ultrasound. The Sr and Pb isotope analyses were analyzed at Beijing Createch Testing Technology Co., Ltd., employing a Thermo Fisher Scientific Neptune Plus MC-ICP-MS."

The human enamel samples exhibited a wide range of 87Sr/86Sr values, ranging from 0.707903 to 0.712062. The mean 87Sr/86Sr value of all the 56 samples was 0.709408 ± 0.00086(1 SD), and the mean 87Sr/86Sr value after removing the outliers was 0.709116 ± 0.000261 (1 SD).",

In the last phase, the proportion of non-locals decreased again (16.13%), with a cultural shift toward integration into the system of the Western States Uighur Kingdom. Geopolitics largely influenced migratory behavior and cultural interaction during the 7th to 12th centuries in the eastern Tianshan Mountains.",

The mobility scales of the three stages alter when the diverse burial styles and chronologies are taken into account (also the three burial types). Six non-locals were observed in the SCG, which prevailed in the early phase (early-mid 7th century, 54.55%, 6/11). There were four non-locals in SPG (mid-7th and mid-8th centuries, 30.77%, 4/13). Moreover, five non-locals were found in SGG, popular in the late phase (10th-12th centuries, 16.13%, 5/31).",
