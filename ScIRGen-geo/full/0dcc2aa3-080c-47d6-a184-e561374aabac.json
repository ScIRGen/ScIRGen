            "description": "This dataset is the spatial distribution map of the marshes in the source area of the Yellow River near the Zaling Lake-Eling Lake, covering an area of about 21,000 square kilometers. The data set is classified by the Landsat 8 image through an expert decision tree and corrected by manual visual interpretation. The spatial resolution of the image is 30m, using the WGS 1984 UTM projected coordinate system, and the data format is grid format. The image is divided into five types of land, the land type 1 is “water body”, the land type 2 is “high-cover vegetation”, the land type 3 is “naked land”, and the land type 4 is “low-cover vegetation”, and the land type 5 is For \"marsh\", low-coverage vegetation and high-coverage vegetation are distinguished by vegetation coverage. The threshold is 0.1 to 0.4 for low-cover vegetation and 0.4 to 1 for high-cover vegetation.",

                "Snow cover is an important land-surface variable, especially in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), and profoundly impacts surface energy exchange, and regional climate, hydrology, and ecosystems. The QTP, the world’s largest and highest plateau—with an average elevation exceeding 4000 m above sea level—is “the sensitive area” for global climate change. Snow cover is often regarded as an indicator of climate change in the QTP, and is closely linked with the general circulation and monsoon systems over eastern and southern Asia during spring and summer. The snow cover over the QTP strongly determines the regional water sources in western China, and regulates the runoff of several major rivers (e.g., the Yangtze River, and the Yellow River). In response to climate warming, the snow cover phenology has experienced remarkable changes. Numerous studies have robustly documented a shortening of snow cover duration, with a delayed snow starting date and advanced snow ending date, at both a local and regional scale. Remotely sensed data provide temporally and spatially continuous information over land surfaces, and are useful for accurately parameterizing snow cover. When compared with various satellite-based snow-cover products, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-cover products have advantages in terms of temporal and spatial resolution. Currently, the MODIS snow-cover products have been widely used to monitor snow cover in various regions, especially at high latitudes and in European high mountain regions."

                "Snow cover is an indicator for global climate change. Previous studies have indicated that approximately 98% of the seasonal snow cover on the earth is located in the Northern Hemisphere. The snow cover extent has decreased considerably and retreated to higher altitudes, and the inter-annual snow cover variability has increased. The snow-covered area (SCA) in the Northern Hemisphere from 1970 to 2010 in March and April exhibited a decreasing trend, and, on average, it decreased by approximately 8 ×10^5 km^2 each decade due to increasing temperatures, and the decay has accelerated during the past 40 years. Snow cover duration exhibits the strongest climate sensitivity, and temperature increases can postpone the snow cover accumulation date and the maximum SCA change from February to January, which causes the snow ablation date to arrive earlier in the spring. The high albedo of snow can significantly reduce the capability of the ground surface to receive solar radiation and has a positive feedback effect on the climate system; in particular, positive albedo feedback in the spring period generates a stronger signal in spring snow cover duration. The winter SCA, duration, snow depth, and resulting variation in the surface albedo have significant influences on the atmospheric circulation at local and regional scales. Between the 1980s and the 21st century, the SCA decreased at a rate of (-0.55 ±0.21) ×10^6 km^2 per decade in spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2013) has evaluated the variation in snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere over the past 50 years, and the SCA during the spring in the Northern Hemisphere has continued to decrease (with high confidence). In the Northern Hemisphere, the average reduction rate of the SCA in March and April is 1.6% 10−a and is 11.7% 10−a in June, while the SCA does not exhibit a statistically significant increase in any month. Remote sensing techniques have the advantages of high temporal and spatial resolution, strong objective authenticity, low cost, and high effectiveness, which provide effective snow cover parameters for climate models at global and regional scales. These techniques expand the traditional, limited “point” information to regional information that indicates the actual situation and plays an important role in large-scale high-precision monitoring of the earth’s snow cover. Currently, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are most widely used. MODIS is aboard the earth observation satellites Terra and Aqua, which are the main sensors of the Earth Observation System (EOS). The spatial and spectral resolution are better than the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the temporal resolution is better than the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+). Thus, MODIS is the optimal data source for real-time monitoring of large-scale SCA with high accuracy."

However, the overall accuracy of the IMS is far lower than that of the MODIS, and the timing of IMS snow disappearance lags behind the MODIS during the spring ablation season by several weeks, which may affect our understanding of the seasonal snow cover cycle and development of parameterization schemes for climate models."

                "We conducted the maximum SCA fusion processing of the data for two products, MOD10A1 and MYD10A1, from the MODIS morning and afternoon tracks. We used the snow cover image from the previous and posterior day to eliminate the cloud pixels in the snow cover image of the current day, and we ensure a minimum amount of clouds after these processes. The AMSR-E daily SWE product (filling the gap—using the AMSR-E images of the closest date to replace missing data with maximum values)/IMS product are used to completely eliminate the remaining cloud pixels. Using these procedures, we eliminated all cloud pixels and generated MODIS daily cloud-free binary snow cover images (MOYDCA) with a spatial resolution of 500 m, which were used to verify the accuracy for the Northern Hemisphere. We first conducted the radiation calibration and the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) atmospheric correction in ENVI 5.3 (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, Colorado, USA). Then, we used the second and fifth wave bands of the TM images to calculate the NDSI. We used the Pixel Aggregate tool in ENVI to resample aggregately the Landsat binary snow cover image using a 500-m grid size. The Kappa consistency test method was adopted to analyze the accuracy of the MODIS cloud-free daily snow cover product obtained in this study."

                "The maximum, minimum, and annual average SCA in the Northern Hemisphere all exhibited a downward trend with fluctuations. The variation trend in snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere exhibited significant inter-annual and regional differences. The largest average SCA in the Northern Hemisphere occurred in January, while the smallest was in August. For the monthly variations, between 2000 and 2015, the SCA in the Northern Hemisphere for January, July, and October exhibited an upward trend, while the SCA in February, March, April, June, August, and December exhibited a downward trend. As for the seasonal variation, the SCA in the Northern Hemisphere during the spring, summer, and fall seasons exhibited a downward trend. The reduction magnitude of the SCA was relatively large in the spring and summer, and the SCA in winter did not exhibit an obvious trend. The spatial distribution of the annual average SCDs was based on latitudinal zonality. The upward trend region was mainly confined to the mid- to low-latitude seasonal SCA with unstable snow cover. A decreasing trend in the SCA was observed in regions with perennial snow cover, including the high-latitude or high-elevation mountainous regions in the Northern Hemisphere (between 35° and 50°N), such as the Tibetan Plateau, the Tianshan Mountains, the Pamir Plateau in Asia, the Alps in Europe, the Caucasus Mountains, and the Cordillera Mountains in North America. Overall, the perennial snow in the Northern Hemisphere is transitioning to seasonal snow cover."
