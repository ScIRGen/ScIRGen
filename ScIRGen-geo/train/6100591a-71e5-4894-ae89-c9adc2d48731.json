            "description": "This dataset includes two tree-ring width sequences and two tree-ring timelines for the Ishim-Tobol River basin. In the areas with little influence from human activities and natural disasters, conifer species with thinner soil layer, steeper slope, longer tree age and clear annual rings should be selected. The tree core sample was drilled about 1.3m above the ground using a growth cone. A total of 263 cores from 143 Scotch pine and birch trees were collected, air-dried, fixed in special wooden trays using white latex, and sanded until clear. Scan the image using Epson12000XL and measure the tree ring width using CDendro 9.4 software. The COFECHA and ARSTAN programs were used for cross-dating and the growth trend was removed based on the negative exponential function. Finally, the tree ring width difference chronology was established. This dataset can be used for river flow reconstruction. The expanded flow records reveal hydrological changes in the basin over the past 229 years. The reconstruction discharge from 1788-2016 was lower than the average for a long time, indicating that the drought deficit in the basin was more prominent. This phenomenon is significantly influenced by water vapor transport in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of dendrochronology, 'tree-ring width sequence' refers to the chronological series of measurements of the width of annual growth rings in trees. It is applied in data collection by extracting tree core samples using an increment borer at about 1.3 meters above the ground. The cores are then dried, mounted, and sanded for clarity. Tree-ring widths are measured using imaging and software tools like Epson12000XL and CDendro 9.4. These sequences are used to create chronologies that can help reconstruct historical environmental conditions, such as river flow variations over time.",

The reconstructed flow data indicates a long-term trend of flow being below average from 1788 to 2016, highlighting a prominent drought condition in the basin. This phenomenon is significantly influenced by moisture transport from the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.",
