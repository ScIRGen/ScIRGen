            "description": "The ground-based observation dataset of aerosol optical properties over the Tibetan Plateau was obtained by continuous observation with a Cimel 318  sunphotometer, involving two stations: Qomolangma Station and Nam Co Station. These products have taken the process  of cloud detection. The data cover the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, and the time resolution is daily. The sunphotometer has eight observation channels from visible light to near infrared, and the central wavelengths are 340, 380, 440, 500, 670, 870, 940 and 1120 nm, respectively. The field of view angle of the instrument is 1.2°, and the sun tracking accuracy is 0.1°. Six bands of aerosol optical thickness can be obtained from direct solar radiation, and the accuracy is estimated to be 0.01-0.02. Finally, AERONET unified inversion algorithm was used to obtain the aerosol optical thickness, Ångström index, aerosol particle size distribution, single scattering albedo, phase function, complex refraction index and asymmetry factor.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is one of the most imposing topographic features on the surface of the Earth. With an immense area (about 2,500,000 km2) and mean elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level, TP plays a key role in Asia climatology and atmospheric circulation. Meanwhile, the atmosphere over the plateau is probably the least affected by human activities in the Asian continent due to the sparse population and minimal industries, providing a unique opportunity to describe atmospheric processes and changes. In this context, several model simulation and satellite observation works have been carried out over the TP to elucidate the effects of aerosol on regional climate and water cycles. However, ground-based optical characterizations of aerosols are scarce at TP. Considering its huge area and essential role in the climate system, the lack of detailed knowledge of aerosol optical properties over TP leads to large uncertainties in climate modeling and assessments. AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a worldwide aerosol characterization network with the automatic CIMEL Sun/sky radiometer as the principal instrument. Due to its significant advances on observation techniques and analysis methods, AERONET has been producing reliably and continuously detailed optical properties of various types of aerosols worldwide."
