Long-term glacier melt fluctuations over the past 2500 yr in monsoonal high asia revealed by radiocarbon-dated lacustrine pollen concentrates. Geology, 45(4), 359-362.\nIn this paper, the researcher of Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences and CAS Center for Excellence in Tibetan Plateau Earth Sciences, Baiqing Xu, with his postdoctoral fellow, Jifeng Zhang, and collaborators from Peking University and other institutions, propose that the OPE (“old pollen effect”, the offset between the calibrated 14C ages of pollen in lake sediments and the sediment depositional age) as a new indicator of glacier melt intensity and fluctuations by measuring the radiocarbon ages of the sediments of the proglacial lake of Qiangyong Glacier on the southern Tibetan Plateau with multi-methods (bulk organic matter, pollen concentrates and plant residues). This research suggests that hemispheric-scale temperature variations and mid-latitude Westerlies may be the main controllers of the late Holocene glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia. It also shows that the 20th-century glacier melt intensity exceeded that of two historical warm epochs (the Medieval Warm Period, and the Iron/Roman Age Optimum) and is unprecedented at least for the past 2.5 k.y.\nThis data is provided by the author of the paper, it contains long-term glacier melt fluctuations of Qiangyong Glacier over the past 2500 yr reconstructed by the OPE.\nA 3.06-m-long core (QYL09-4) and a 1.06-m-long parallel gravity core (QY-3) were retrieved by the researchers from the depositional center of Qiangyong Co. Using a new composite extraction procedure, they obtained relatively pure pollen concentrates and plant residue concentrates (PRC; >125 μm) from the finely laminated sediments. Bulk organic matter and the PRC and pollen fractions were used for 14C dating independently. All 14C ages were calibrated with IntCal13 (Reimer et al., 2013). The age-depth model is based on 210Pb and 137Cs ages and five 14C ages of PRC. Only the youngest PRC ages were used for the age-depth model, whereas older ages that produce a stratigraphic reversal and are apparently influenced by redeposited or aquatic plant material were rejected. The deposition model was constructed using the P_Sequence algorithm in Oxcal 4.2 (Bronk Ramsey, 2008). For the calculation of the offset between the calibrated pollen 14C ages and the sediment depositional age, 2σ intervals for interpolated ages according to the deposition model were subtracted from calibrated pollen ages (2σ span), resulting in the age offset between pollen and estimated sediment ages (ΔAgepollen).\nThis data is radiocarbon ages and the calculated ΔAgepollen of core QYL09-4 from a proglacial lake of Qiangyong Glacier.\nThe data contains fields as follows:\t\t\t\t\nLab No.\nDating Material\nDepth (cm)\n14C age (yr BP)\n∆Agepollen (≥95.4 % yrs)\nSediment Age (CE)\nSee attachments for data details: ZhangJF et al. 2017 GEOLOGY_Long-term glacier melt fluctuations over the past 2500 yr on the Tibetan Plateau.pdf.",

        "Long-term records of glacier mass changes are important for improving our understanding of glacier dynamics and for predicting the response of glaciers to future climate change. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surroundings contain the largest number of glaciers outside the polar regions and have shown spatially heterogeneous glacier responses to global warming. Moraine sequences directly record ice margin change, but they are discrete low-resolution series and can be easily eroded by subsequent glacial advances of a larger extent. Multi-proxies (e.g., organic matter content, elements, and grain size) from proglacial lake sediments have been used to reconstruct continuous records of glacier change, but nonglacial processes (e.g., rainfall events, colluvial activity, and debris flows) can confound the extraction of glacial signals. Pollen preserved in Tibetan ice cores has been used to reconstruct past climate change, but no studies have focused on the effects of the melt of old ice in terms of the release of old pollen. According to a conceptual model of glacier flow, young ice containing modern pollen is formed in the accumulation area and then flows slowly to the ablation area and becomes a reservoir of old pollen. Intensified glacier melt releases more old pollen from the old ice, which, together with overridden soil from beneath the glacier, enters proglacial lakes and results in a larger offset between the calibrated 14C ages of pollen in lake sediments and the sediment depositional age."

      "research objective": [
        "We define the offset between the calibrated pollen 14C ages and the sediment depositional age as the “old pollen effect” (OPE). We interpret the OPE as a new indicator of glacier melt intensity and its fluctuations. We propose that the OPE can be a new indicator of glacier melt intensity and fluctuations. Sediments from lake Qiangyong Co, China, were used to test our hypothesis through comparisons of the OPE against regional moraine ages. A 2.5 k.y. record of glacier variability is presented and is compared with other paleoclimatic and paleoglacial records in order to infer spatial correlations and dynamics of late Holocene glacier change in monsoonal High Asia."

Several studies have integrated sporadic moraine ages on the TP; however, some of the ages are questionable, and temporal and spatial patterns of glacier fluctuations remain unclear. Moraine sequences directly record ice margin change, but they are discrete low-resolution series and can be easily eroded by subsequent glacial advances of a larger extent. Multi-proxies from proglacial lake sediments have been used to reconstruct continuous records of glacier change, but nonglacial processes can confound the extraction of glacial signals."

Our reconstructed glacier variability agrees well with glacier fluctuations in the European Alps and the global average temperature record, suggesting that hemispheric-scale temperature variations and/or mid-latitude Westerlies may have controlled the late Holocene glacier variability in monsoonal High Asia. We also show that the 20th century glacier melt intensity has exceeded that of two historical warm periods and is unprecedented over the past 2.5 k.y.

        "AnswerEn": "One of the main challenges in employing multi-proxy approaches is the difficulty in distinguishing between glacial and nonglacial signals due to confounding factors such as rainfall events, colluvial activity, and debris flows. These nonglacial processes can obscure the extraction of clear glacial signals from lake sediment data, complicating the interpretation of glacier dynamics over time.",
        "AnswerCn": "采用多代理方法的主要挑战之一是由于降雨事件、堆积活动和碎屑流等混杂因素，难以区分冰川信号和非冰川信号。这些非冰川过程可能会掩盖湖泊沉积物数据中清晰冰川信号的提取，从而使冰川动态的时间解释变得复杂。",

        "AnswerEn": "The 'old pollen effect' (OPE) is defined as the offset between the calibrated pollen 14C ages and the sediment depositional age. It is interpreted as a new indicator of glacier melt intensity because intensified glacier melt releases more old pollen from the old ice, which, together with overridden soil from beneath the glacier, enters proglacial lakes. This results in a larger offset between the calibrated 14C ages of pollen in lake sediments and the sediment depositional age.",
        "AnswerCn": "“旧花粉效应”（OPE）被定义为校准的花粉14C年龄与沉积物沉积年龄之间的偏差。它被解释为冰川融化强度的新指标，因为加剧的冰川融化会释放更多来自旧冰的旧花粉，这些花粉与冰川下方的覆盖土壤一起进入冰川前湖泊。这导致湖泊沉积物中花粉的校准14C年龄与沉积物沉积年龄之间的偏差增大。",

        "AnswerEn": "One of the challenges in using multi-proxies from proglacial lake sediments to reconstruct continuous records of glacier change is that nonglacial processes such as rainfall events, colluvial activity, and debris flows can confound the extraction of glacial signals. This makes it difficult to isolate and accurately interpret the glacial signals from other environmental and geological factors influencing the sediment record.",
        "AnswerCn": "使用来自冰川前湖沉积物的多重代理来重建冰川变化的连续记录面临的挑战之一是，非冰川过程如降雨事件、崩塌活动和碎屑流可能会干扰冰川信号的提取。这使得从其他环境和地质因素影响的沉积记录中孤立和准确解释冰川信号变得困难。",

        "AnswerEn": "Challenges in extracting continuous records from proglacial lake sediments include interference from nonglacial processes such as rainfall events, colluvial activity, and debris flows. These processes can confound the extraction of glacial signals. Alternative data collection methods could involve using multi-proxies like organic matter content, elements, and grain size analysis, along with advanced radiocarbon dating techniques to isolate glacial signals more effectively.",

        "AnswerEn": "A research approach to enhance understanding of glacier dynamics using the 'old pollen effect' could involve collecting and analyzing sediments from multiple proglacial lakes to compare the old pollen effect across different regions. This would allow for the examination of spatial correlations between glacier melt intensity and climatic factors such as temperature variations and mid-latitude Westerlies. Implementing high-resolution chronological frameworks and integrating data with other paleoclimatic indicators could provide deeper insights into glacier dynamics.",
        "AnswerCn": "一种增强对冰川动态理解的研究方法是利用“古花粉效应”，通过收集和分析来自多个冰川前湖的沉积物，以比较不同地区的古花粉效应。这将允许研究冰川融化强度与气候因素（如温度变化和中纬度西风带）之间的空间相关性。实施高分辨率的年代框架，并将数据与其他古气候指标整合，可以提供对冰川动态的更深入见解。",

Methods for integrating these datasets into existing models might involve using statistical techniques to correlate the old pollen effect with moraine sequences and regional climate proxies. This integration can be facilitated by constructing comprehensive age-depth models and employing algorithms like P_Sequence in Oxcal for chronological alignment.",
