            "description": "The dataset of ground-based RPG-8CH-DP microwave radiometers (6.925H/V, 18.7H/V and 36.5H/V) and ground truth observations for snow was obtained in the Binggou watershed foci experimental area on Mar. 24 (time-continuous from 11:42 to 17:28 BJT) and Mar. 25, 2008 (short-time multi-angle observations). A gentle slope of 10° was chosen as the observation site, where there was firn snow and the snow layer and the ice layer appeared alternately. The radiometer beam was set from -20° to -55°, with the steplength 5°.\n     Observation items included:\n     (1) The brightness temperature by the microwave radiometer in .BRT and .txt (the ASCII format). Each row in .txt was listed by year, month, date, hour, minute, second, 6.925GHz (h), 6.925GHz (v), 10.65GHz (h), 10.65GHz (v) , 18.7GHz (h), 18.7GHz (v), 36.5GHz (h), 36.5GHz (v), the elevation angle, and the azimuth angle. Values for 6.925GHz and 10.65GHz were zero due to the absence of these two radiometers.\n     (2)  Snow parameters including the snow profile temperature by the probe thermometer and the handheld infrared thermometer, the snow grain size by the handheld microscope, snow moisture, snow density, and snow permittivity by the snow fork.\n     Five subfolders are archived, including the brightness temperature and the profiles of liquid water content, the snow grain size, snow density and the snow temperature.",

These observations provide data on brightness temperature at various frequencies, which are used to infer snow properties. The observations can be conducted continuously or at multiple angles to capture different perspectives of the snowpack. The data collected assist in the inversion and validation of snow parameters for airborne and spaceborne microwave remote sensing applications.",

                    "Answer": "Conducting microwave radiation snow observations in an area with alternating snow and ice layers can influence data accuracy and parameter inversion by creating variability in the observed brightness temperatures. The presence of distinct layers may lead to differential absorption and scattering of microwave signals, potentially complicating the retrieval of snow parameters such as depth and water content. Additionally, these alternating layers can pose challenges in validating airborne and satellite microwave remote sensing data, as ground-truth data must accurately account for the heterogeneity introduced by the snow and ice layers.",

                    "Answer": "The goal is to provide essential datasets for the retrieval and validation of snow parameters using airborne and satellite-based microwave remote sensing. Ground-based observations offer detailed measurements of snow characteristics, such as brightness temperatures, snow profile temperature, grain size, humidity, density, and dielectric constant, under controlled conditions. These data can improve the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing models by offering a reference point for comparison and calibration.",

Calibration involves ensuring the functionality of different frequency channels, although issues with the 6.925GHz and 10.65GHz channels resulted in those values being zeroed. Observations include brightness temperature measurements and snow parameter assessments using thermometers, microscopes, and snow characteristic analyzers.",
