The dataset was produced based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method by fusing six satellite-derived evapotranspiration products including RS-PM (Mu et al., 2011), SW (Shuttleworth and Wallace., 1985), PT-JPL (Fisher et al., 2008), MS-PT (Yao et al., 2013), SEMI-PM (Wang et al., 2010a) and SIM (Wang et al.2008). The input variables for the evapotranspiration products include MODIS products, and MERRA meteorological data.",

This approach potentially improves the accuracy by combining aspects of RS-PM, SW, PT-JPL, MS-PT, SEMI-PM, and SIM methods, which might individually be limited in resolution or accuracy.
