            "description": "Based on the field survey results of this project, the previous hydrogeological survey results and the prediction and judgment of desert depressions, we obtained more than 600 known water level points in badain jaran desert and its surrounding areas, and drew a first-order approximate contour map of the groundwater level in badan jaran desert by using the measured or predicted groundwater level data.This isometric chart fills a gap in the study of groundwater in badain jaran desert.\nThe so-called first-order approximation is the distribution of the macroscopic groundwater level, which reaches a resolution of 1 km on the spatial scale, and it is assumed that the groundwater level in the shallow and deep layers is the same, and the groundwater in the quaternary and bedrock distribution areas remains continuous.The error level of the first-order approximate contour is ± 10 m, which mainly comes from the uncertainty of ground elevation data.\nThis data set contains a vector diagram of the groundwater level contour line and a raster data file.",

The error level for these contours is ±10 meters, primarily due to uncertainties in surface elevation data.",

This approach helps to fill research gaps in groundwater studies in desert areas, such as the Badain Jaran Desert. However, the accuracy of this mapping is affected by an error margin of ±10 meters, primarily due to uncertainties in ground elevation data.",

                    "Answer": "The objective of creating a dataset that includes the first-order approximation contour map of groundwater levels in the Badain Jaran Desert is to fill the research gap in groundwater studies within this region. By integrating field survey results, previous hydrogeological investigations, and inferred data on desert depressions, the dataset provides a macroscopic view of groundwater level distribution with a spatial resolution of 1 km. This contributes to the understanding of groundwater distribution by offering a comprehensive and continuous representation of shallow and deep groundwater levels across Quaternary and bedrock distribution areas, despite an error margin of ±10 m due to ground elevation data uncertainties.",

These data points, whether directly measured or estimated, are used to construct a first-order approximate contour map of groundwater levels. The process assumes that shallow and deep groundwater levels are the same and that groundwater in Quaternary and bedrock distribution areas is continuous. The error level of the first-order approximate contour map is ± 10 m, primarily due to uncertainties in ground elevation data.",
