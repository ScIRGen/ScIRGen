            "description": "The data set includes the observation data of river water level and velocity at No.7 point in the dense observation of runoff in the middle reaches of Heihe River from January 1, 2015 to March 11, 2016. The sensor was abnormal at the end of 2014, and the commissioning was normal on March 25 after maintenance. The observation point is located in Heihe bridge, Pingchuan Township, Linze County, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The riverbed is sandy gravel with unstable section. The longitude and latitude of the observation point are n39.331667 °, e100.099722 °, altitude 1375 meters, and channel width 130 meters. In 2015, sr50 ultrasonic distance meter was used for water level observation, with acquisition frequency of 30 minutes. Data description includes:\nWater level observation, observation frequency 30 minutes, unit (cm); The missing data are uniformly represented by the string -6999.\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Li et al.(2013), and for observation data processing, please refer to He et al.(2016).",
