            "description": "This data set includes observation data of meteorological elements in the downstream desert station of Heihe Hydrometeorological Observation Network from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The site is located in the desert beach of Ejina Banner, Inner Mongolia, and the underlying surface is desert. The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 100.9872E, 42.1135N, and the altitude is 1054m. The air temperature and relative humidity sensors are installed at 5m and 10m, facing the north; the barometer is installed at 2m; the tipping bucket rain gauge is installed at 10m; the wind speed sensor is set at 5m, 10m, and the wind direction sensor is set at 10m, facing the north; the four-component radiometer is installed at 6m, facing south; two infrared thermometers are installed at 6m, facing south, the probe orientation is vertically downward; the soil temperature probe is buried in the ground surface 0cm and underground 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm 40cm, 60cm and 100cm, in the south of the 2m from the meteorological tower; soil moisture sensors are buried in the underground 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 100cm, in the south of the 2m from the meteorological tower; soil heat flux plates (3 pieces) are buried in the ground 6 cm in order.\nObservation items include: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5m, RH_5m, Ta_10m, RH_10m) (unit: centigrade, percentage), air pressure (Press) (unit: hectopascal), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), wind speed (WS_5m, WS_10m) (unit: m / s), wind direction (WD_10m) (unit: degree), four-component radiation (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts / square meter), surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2 ) (unit: centigrade), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watts/square meter), soil moisture (Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm, Ms_10cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_40cm, Ms_60cm, Ms_100cm) (unit: volumetric water content, percentage) and soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_40cm, Ts_60cm, Ts_100cm) (unit: centigrade).\nProcessing and quality control of the observation data: (1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10 minutes), when there is missing data, it is marked by -6999; (2) eliminate the moment with duplicate records; (3) delete the data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument; (5) the format of date and time is uniform, and the date and time are in the same column. For example, the time is: 2016-6-10 10:30; (6) the naming rules are: AWS+ site name.\nFor hydrometeorological network or site information, please refer to Li et al. (2013).

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.

                    "Answer": "In oasis-desert systems, variations in instrumentation and scale significantly affect the collection and interpretation of eco-hydrological processes. The use of hierarchically nested scales with instruments like eddy covariance towers, large aperture scintillometers, and automatic meteorological stations allows researchers to capture multi-scale processes. However, challenges arise in ensuring data consistency and integration across these scales. For example, instruments placed at different scales might measure varying microclimates or hydrological conditions, requiring careful calibration and data processing to accurately interpret the interactions between oasis and desert systems.",

These errors are often exacerbated by the difficulty in accurately determining soil and vegetation component temperatures from surface composite radiometric temperatures.",

These stations should be strategically placed across different landscapes, such as deserts and oases, to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. Additionally, eddy covariance systems and scintillometers are required for measuring turbulent fluxes, and a network of soil moisture sensors should be established.

Quality control procedures must include regular sensor maintenance and calibration, as well as data validation checks to identify and correct anomalies. Data gaps might be flagged with placeholders, such as -6999, and redundant data points should be identified and removed. Additionally, classification errors in remote sensing data can lead to uncertainties, which require rigorous validation and correction protocols.",
