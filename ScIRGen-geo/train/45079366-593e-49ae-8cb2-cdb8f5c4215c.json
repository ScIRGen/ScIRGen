            "description": "By applying Supply-demand Balance Analysis, the water resource supply and demand of the whole river basin and each county or district were calculated, on which basis the vulnerability of the water resources system of the basin was evaluated. The IPAT equation was used to set a future water resource demand scenario, setting variables such as future population growth rate, economic growth rate, and unit GDP water consumption to establish the scenario. By taking 2005 as the base year and using assorted forecasting data of population size and economic scale, the future water demand scenarios of various counties and cities from 2010 to 2050 were predicted. \nBy applying the basic structure of the HBV conceptual hydrological model of the Swedish Hydrometeorological Institute, a model of the variation tendency of the basin under climate change was designed. The glacial melting scenario was used as the model input to construct the runoff scenario under climate change. According to the national regulations for the water resources allocation of the basin, a water distribution plan was set up to calculate the water supply comprehensively. Considering the supply and demand situation, the water resource system vulnerability was evaluated by the water shortage rate. By calculating the (grain production) land pressure index of the major counties and cities in the basin, the balance of supply and demand of land resources under the climate change, glacial melt and population growth scenarios was analyzed, and the vulnerability of the agricultural system was evaluated. The Miami formula and HANPP model were used to calculate the human appropriation of net primary biomass and primary biomass in the major counties and cities for the future, and the vulnerability of ecosystems from the perspective of supply and demand balance was assessed.",

This approach focuses on creating water demand scenarios. In contrast, modeling approaches that utilize the HBV hydrological model for climate change scenarios involve designing models to simulate basin changes under climate change, using inputs like glacier melt scenarios. These approaches focus on creating runoff scenarios by considering climate variables, making the IPAT equation more socio-economically oriented and the HBV model more physically and climate-oriented.",

By analyzing the variability and trends in water supply and demand across different counties and districts, especially under scenarios of population growth, economic development, and changing climate conditions, one can assess how susceptible the system is to shortages or stress. The data allows for evaluating the impact of factors like population growth rate, economic growth speed, and water consumption per unit GDP on water demand, and how these factors contribute to vulnerability. The vulnerability is further characterized by the water shortage rate, which serves as an indicator of system stress under various scenarios.",

Additionally, the application of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute's HBV hydrological model structure to design models for basin change trends under climate change, using glacier melting scenarios as inputs, affects the predictions. The national and local regulations for water resource allocation and the computation of water supply against demand, using water scarcity rates as indicators, are also crucial. Furthermore, the evaluation of agricultural system vulnerability through land pressure index calculations and the use of the Miami equation and HANPP model to assess ecosystem vulnerability under different scenarios adds to the complexity and potential variability in predictions.",

This method facilitates the creation of comprehensive water demand scenarios for each county from 2010 to 2050, and its impact on water resource system vulnerability assessment includes providing a structured approach to simulate future demand under various socio-economic conditions.

This involves evaluating the impact of future scenarios such as population growth, economic development, and climate change, including glacier melting and climate-induced changes in runoff patterns, on the water supply and demand. Additionally, it aims to evaluate agricultural and ecosystem vulnerabilities by analyzing land resource supply and demand and human appropriation of net primary production.
