It is a land use database in Zhangye City based on Landsat TM and ETM remote sensing data.  The land use data adopts a hierarchical land cover classification system, which divides the land use types of Zhangye City into 6 first-class categories (cultivated land, forest land, grassland, water area, land for urban and rural industrial and mining residents and unused land) and 25 second-class categories.  The data range includes Shandan, Minle, Linze, Gaotai, Sunan Yugu Autonomous County and Ganzhou District.  The classification standard adopts the land use classification standard used by the Chinese Academy of Sciences since 1986.  The data type is vector polygon and stored in Shape format.  The data range covers Zhangye City.",

This involves assigning specific categories, such as cultivated land, forest, grassland, water bodies, urban areas, and unused land, to different regions based on satellite imagery. The classification system can be hierarchical, with primary and secondary classification levels, to provide detailed information about the land use and cover patterns in a given area.",

This database adopts a layered land cover classification system, dividing the land use types in Zhangye City into six primary categories (arable land, forest land, grassland, water bodies, urban industrial and mining residential land, and unused land) and 25 secondary classifications. The classification standards follow those used by the Chinese Academy of Sciences since 1986.
