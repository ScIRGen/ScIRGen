            "description": "The evapotranspiration and soil evapotranspiration of lycium rubra and red sand of small shrubs in typical desert weather were observed by using infrared gas analyzer to measure water vapor flux.\nThe measurement system consists of li-8100 closed-circuit automatic measurement of soil carbon flux (li-cor, USA) and an assimilation box designed and manufactured by Beijing ligotai technology co., LTD. Li-8100 is an instrument produced by li-cor for soil carbon flux measurement. It USES an infrared gas analyzer to measure the concentration of CO2 and H2O.The length, width and height of the assimilation box are all 50cm.The assimilation box is controlled by li-8100. After setting up the measurement parameters, the instrument can run automatically.",
