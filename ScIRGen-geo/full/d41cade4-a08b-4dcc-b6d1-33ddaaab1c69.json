            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Zhangye wetland station eddy covariance system (EC) in the middle reaches of the Heihe hydrometeorological observation network from 15 September, 2012, to 21 November, 2013. The site (100.446° E, 38.975° N) was located in the desert steppe surface, near Zhangye city in Gansu Province. The elevation is 1460 m. The EC was installed at a height of 5.2 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (Gill&Li7500A) was 0.25 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software (Li-Cor Company, http://www.licor.com/env/products/eddy_covariance/software.html), including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC), as proposed by Foken and Wichura [1996]: class 1 (level 0: Δst<30 and ITC<30), class 2 (level 1: Δst<100 and ITC<100), and class 3 (level 2: Δst>100 and ITC>100), which represent high-, medium-, and low-quality data, respectively. In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened using a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. Due to the calibration of CO2/H2O gas analyzer and CF card storage problem, data during 28 May to 30 May, and 21 November to 31 December, 2013 were missing.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m^3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m^3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m^2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m^2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m^2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. \nFor more information, please refer to Li et al.

The processing steps include spike removal, time delay correction, angle correction, coordinate rotation (double coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, sonic temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. Additionally, quality evaluation of flux values is performed, focusing on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Data is filtered to remove errors from instrument glitches, precipitation events, high missing rates, and weak nighttime turbulence, ensuring reliability.",

                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance method refers to a technique used to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within the atmosphere. In the context of hydrometeorological data collection, it involves using an eddy covariance system, which includes instruments like a sonic anemometer and a CO2/H2O analyzer, to capture data on wind speed, temperature, and gas concentrations at high frequencies (e.g., 10Hz). The data collected is often processed using specialized software, such as Eddypro, to produce averaged flux measurements over set intervals (e.g., 30 minutes), while applying corrections and quality assessments, such as despiking, delay time correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and WPL density correction.",

                    "Answer": "In a dataset, the quality assessment of flux values is based on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). These metrics help determine the reliability of the observed data by classifying them into quality levels. Data with lower Δst and ITC values indicate more stable atmospheric conditions and reliable turbulence measurements. Conversely, higher values suggest less reliable data due to atmospheric instability or inadequate turbulence representation.",

                    "Answer": "The need for specific data processing steps like delay time correction and coordinate rotation in hydrometeorological data collection using eddy covariance methods arises due to the inherent complexities and potential errors in raw data acquisition. These steps are crucial to ensure accurate measurement of variables like heat and carbon fluxes. Delay time correction is necessary to synchronize the timing between different sensors, while coordinate rotation aligns the wind measurements with the natural wind direction, which is critical for accurate turbulence and flux calculations. These processes help in correcting for any instrumental or environmental factors that may skew the data, such as sensor separation or misalignment, and improve the quality and reliability of the data collected.",

These methods help ensure that the 30-minute flux data are of high quality, with rigorous quality assessment based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics.",

Initially, the data undergoes outlier removal, delay time correction, angle correction, and coordinate rotation (secondary coordinate rotation). Further processing includes frequency response correction, sonic virtual temperature correction, and density correction (WPL correction). The data is also subjected to quality evaluation based on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). Additional filtering involves removing erroneous instrument data, data one hour before and after precipitation, data with a missing rate greater than 3% in each 30-minute interval, and nighttime weak turbulence data (u* less than 0.1 m/s). Processed data are averaged over 30-minute periods and missing data are marked as -6999. Suspicious data due to instrument drift are marked in red, and specific periods of missing data due to calibration or storage errors are noted.",
