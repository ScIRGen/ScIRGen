            "description": "In order to describe the distribution pattern of genetic diversity of main domesticated animals in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas (Pan third pole area), and clarify its related genetic background. In 2020, we extracted the total DNA from 201 global chicken blood, tissue and other DNA tissue samples, built a database and sequenced the whole genome. At the same time, we downloaded the published chicken genome data, and carried out population analysis of 863 chicken genomes, so as to provide basic data for exploring the historical events of domestication, migration and expansion of domestic chickens in the pan third pole region, and further explore the adaptation mechanism of domesticated animals to harsh environments such as drying. Articles related to this data set have been published. All data in this data set can be downloaded online from fastq, BAM, VCF and SNP files.",
