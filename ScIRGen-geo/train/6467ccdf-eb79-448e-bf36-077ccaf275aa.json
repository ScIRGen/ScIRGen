            "description": "Grassland is one of the most important ecosystems in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau region, and it is also a natural resource that sustains the production and life of local people. Grass yield is not only a key evaluation indicator of grassland productivity, but also directly affects the carrying capacity of grassland, which is of great significance for guiding the balance of grassland and livestock. It can also provide scientific reference for regional resource development and sustainable socio-economic development decisions. The yield of grass is influenced by multiple factors such as the type of forage, topography, climate conditions, and human activities. This dataset is based on the NPP data product of MODIS, which collects the sample data of underground biomass and aboveground productivity of various grasslands such as alpine meadows, alpine grasslands, alpine deserts, alpine desert grasslands, and temperate grasslands obtained through field sampling and measurement. It is calculated using the grassland vegetation underground productivity model. This dataset contains raster data of grass production in the entire Qinghai Tibet Plateau region every 5 years from 2000 to 2015, with units of g/m2, as well as grass production data in various prefecture level cities on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, with units of 10000 kilograms.",
            "instructions": "File Name: This dataset is stored in GeoTIFF format with the file name \"QTgrassyield_yy. tif\", where \"yy\" represents the data time and spatial resolution of 5km x 5km; Excel data file, named \"QTGrassyield00_15. xlsx\". The time resolution is 5 years. Data reading method: ArcGIS, Excel, R and other software can be used to view and analyze the data.",

                    "Answer": "The variability in the accuracy of grass yield data collection methods on the Tibetan Plateau is influenced by several factors, including the diverse types of grasslands such as alpine meadows, alpine steppes, alpine deserts, alpine desert steppes, and temperate grasslands. Each of these types has different underground biomass and above-ground productivity characteristics. Additionally, the complex topography of the region, varying climate conditions, and human activities further contribute to the variability in data accuracy. The dataset is based on MODIS NPP data products combined with field sampling measurements, and the use of a grassland vegetation underground productivity model aims to address these challenges.",

                    "Answer": "Using MODIS-based NPP data products combined with field-sampled biomass data can enhance the accuracy of productivity assessments by integrating large-scale remote sensing data with localized, precise ground-truth measurements. This approach helps account for variations in grassland productivity influenced by factors such as grass species, topography, climate, and human activities, ultimately providing a more comprehensive understanding of regional resources and supporting sustainable development decisions.",

This evaluation directly influences the carrying capacity of livestock, aids in guiding grass-livestock balance, and provides scientific references for regional resource development, sustainable socio-economic development decision-making.

Ground sampling includes collecting field measurements of aboveground and underground biomass across various grassland types such as alpine meadow, alpine steppe, alpine desert, and temperate grasslands. A grassland vegetation underground productivity model is then applied to compute grassland productivity in terms of grams per square meter. This approach integrates multiple factors including plant species, terrain, climate conditions, and human activities.",
