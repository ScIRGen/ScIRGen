            "description": "About 70% of the world's water withdrawl is used for agriculture, and irrigation water accounts for more than 90% of the total water consumption. Due to varied irrigation water sources, irrigation facilities, and crop planting types, there is large spatial heterogeneity in irrigation water use. Irrigation water can be consumed by evapotranspiration or stored as soil water in the root zone soil layer, while the portion exceeding the saturation zone will recharge groundwater. The complexity of irrigation processes above makes it extremely difficult and challenging to estimate irrigation water use.\nBased on the soil water balance under irrigation, formulas to estimate irrigation water use (IWU) were deduced by us, considering multiple processes of irrigation (evapotranspiration, root zone soil moisture, and deep percolation).  Remotely sensed and modeled actual evapotranspiration, modeled root zone soil moisture were used in our approach to generate the monthly IWU across the continental United States during 2000-2020 at a high spatial resolution (1 km). The results show that our approach has the mechnism to characterize multiple irrigation processes and can obtain IWU data with excelent accuracy at high spatiotemporal resolution.",
            "instructions": "The annual and monthly irrigation water use data are stored in TIF format, and the unit is 'km³/yr' or 'km³/month'. The name of the file is ' yyyy_IWU_irr_area.tif' or 'yyyymm_IWU_irr_area.tif', where 'yyyy' represents the year and 'mm' represents the month. For example, 200501_ IWU_ irr_ area.tif represents this tif file and describes the irrigation water use for the pixel in January 2005. The irrigation water use value takes into account the area difference for different pixels, and the irrigation water use at state or county scales can be obtained by arithmetic average.\nData reading method: all TIF files in the dataset can be read directly using tools such as ArcGIS or MATLAB.",

                    "Answer": "High spatiotemporal resolution in irrigation water use datasets is significant because it captures the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation water use, which is influenced by factors such as irrigation sources, facilities, and crop types. It allows for more precise estimation of irrigation water use by accounting for the complexity of irrigation processes, such as consumption through evapotranspiration and soil water storage, thereby providing data that are more accurate and detailed over both space and time.",

                    "Answer": "The method of estimating irrigation water usage through remote sensing involves calculating water usage by integrating actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture data, offering high spatial (1 km) and temporal (monthly) resolution from 2000 to 2020. This approach provides a more detailed spatial heterogeneity of water usage compared to traditional state and county-level statistics, which are often less precise due to broader aggregation and potentially less frequent updates. The remote sensing method demonstrated higher accuracy in capturing the physical basis of multiple irrigation processes, as verified by comparisons with existing statistical data.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity and challenges in estimating irrigation water usage across different spatial regions in the United States are influenced by factors such as the variability of irrigation sources, the diversity of irrigation infrastructure, and the types of crops grown. These factors create significant spatial heterogeneity in irrigation water usage. Additionally, the complexity of irrigation processes, including how irrigation water is consumed through evapotranspiration, stored in the soil, or recharges groundwater, adds to the difficulty of accurately estimating irrigation water usage.",

This method provides a robust physical basis for characterizing the multi-process nature of irrigation, allowing for enhanced precision in estimating water consumption. It also facilitates validation against state and county-scale irrigation statistics, and comparison with previous research, leading to potentially higher accuracy in irrigation water use data.",

This includes using remote sensing to retrieve actual evapotranspiration and integrating it with model-simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture data. These steps collectively enable the creation of a high spatiotemporal resolution dataset for irrigation water usage across the continental United States from 2000 to 2020.",
