            "description": "Terrestrial water storage (TWS), as a key component of the water cycle, is of great significance for applications in water resource management, disaster monitoring, and agricultural production. Since April 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite (GRACE) and its successor satellites (GRACE-FO) have provided monthly scale TWS data. However, there were 35 months of missing data during the GRACE/GRACE-FO observation period. To fill in the missing data of GRACE/GRACE-FO, we propose a small computational complexity and simple and effective filling method, namely the Singular Spectrum Principal Component Analysis (SSA-PCA) method, and use this method to fill in the missing TWS data of China's land region. The results show that this method has the best performance in the Southwest River Basin (correlation coefficient: 0.71, RMSE: 6.27 cm), the Yangtze River Basin (correlation coefficient: 0.67, RMSE: 3.52 cm), and the Songhua River Basin (SRB, CC: 0.66, RMSE: 7.63 cm), followed by the Haihe River Basin, the Northwest River Basin, the Southeast River Basin, and the Yellow River Basin. Based on twenty years of continuous GRACE/GRACE-FO data, we studied the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of TWS in ten major watersheds in China. The results showed that TWS in the entire land area of China is decreasing at a rate of 0.32 ± 0.06 cm per year, and groundwater storage (GWS) is decreasing at a rate of 0.54 ± 0.10 cm per year. Therefore, utilizing continuous and absence free GRACE/GRACE-FO data can help to gain a deeper understanding of China's terrestrial climate change and its impact on water resource management.",

This method is computationally lightweight and effectively compensates for the 35 months of missing data within the observation period.
