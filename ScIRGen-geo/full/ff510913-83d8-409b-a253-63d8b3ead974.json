Ground-based data collection is synchronized with these flights across various transects, where measurements such as soil moisture, soil temperature, and surface temperature are recorded. Each transect has 25 sampling points spaced 100m apart. At each point, soil samples are collected using a soil corer for moisture and density analysis, while temperature is measured using a needle thermometer for soil and an infrared thermometer for canopy and surface temperatures. Challenges may include ensuring the accurate synchronization of airborne and ground data, dealing with environmental variability, and the precise calibration of instruments for consistent data collection.",
