                "The tropopause is the transition between the troposphere and stratosphere; both have fundamentally different characteristics with respect to chemical processes and dynamical regimes. The tropopause acts as a “two‐way gate” for the exchange of mass, water vapor, and chemical species between troposphere and stratosphere. Since the vertical transport of water vapor and chemical compositions from the troposphere‐stratosphere exchange affects the radiative flux balance in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, the tropopause plays an important role in the dynamical, radiative, and climate change. As a sensitive indicator of climate variability and global change, the tropopause height itself has received much attention in recent years. Using reanalysis data and climate model simulations, Santer et al. [2000, 2003] and Sausen and Santer [2003] pointed out that tropopause height is closely associated with tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. During the last decades, the global mean tropopause height has shown an increase in reanalysis and radiosonde observations. However, either radiosonde or reanalysis data suffers from lower resolution and attendant biases. Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP hereafter), radiosonde stations are sparsely located in the eastern half where the average altitude is pretty low compared with the average elevation of the TP that is over 4500 m above sea level and sometimes called “the roof of the world.” The spatial and temporal scarcity of available observations limits the studies on the characteristics of the tropopause over the TP. As “the global water tower,” the TP is the main pathway for water vapor cross‐tropopause transport, which exerts a major influence on the energy balance of the Earth‐atmosphere system despite its low abundance in the stratosphere. Also, the TP is one of the most sensitive regions to global climate change."

We only consider those profiles that pass quality control and all the valid profiles have been applied unweighted running average among five vertically adjacent points to reduce uncertainty stemming from RO measurements. In section 3, the climatological means, differences, and anomalies of temperatures over the TP (30°–35°N, 87°–95°E) and the Plain (30°–35°N, 112°–120°E) regions are compared. In section 4, a collocation requirement is employed to match the ROs in the Plain region with those in the TP region for further comparison. Using the valid data, we interpolate COSMIC RO retrieved temperatures to the radiosonde stations at the same levels.

The lapse rate tropopause (LRT) shows a strong correlation with thermal properties of the atmosphere. Its height variation is anticorrelated with its temperature, highest at ∼19 km and coldest at approximately −72°C in boreal summer, but lowest at ∼13 km and approximately −56°C in boreal winter. The LRT height is also strongly dependent on the subtropical jet that is associated with the tropopause fold and/or multiple tropopauses, leading to fairly bimodal distribution of the LRT probability density function. As the “roof of the world,” the elevated topography of the TP dynamically lifts the CPT to a higher altitude without significantly seasonal variations. Along the latitude of 32.5°N the CPT is located at ∼18 km over the main body of the TP and drops to ∼15 km over the Plain. Given the area in the TP (30°–35°N, 87°–95°E) as well as in the Plain (30°–35°N, 112°–120°E), the CPT primarily resides at 17–18 km, 72.52% over the TP and 69.22% over the Plain.

                "The land surface soil moisture is a crucial variable in weather and climate models. The soil moisture is an essential variable that governs the interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere. The soil moisture controls the ratio of the runoff to infiltration, controls the surface energy partition, and influences the development of vegetation and the carbon cycle. The soil moisture-precipitation feedback tendency has been identified. Satellite remote sensing provides the opportunity to measure the surface soil moisture at the regional, continental and even global scales. Passive microwave remote sensing provides a means for the direct measurement of the surface soil moisture at a coarse resolution and with a frequent temporal coverage. However, in the field of weather forecast and hydrology modeling, a finer temporal resolution would obviously improve the accuracy and reliability of the forecast. Numerical models can provide continuous estimates of soil moisture over the entire soil profile at any scale. However, due to the model initialization, the parameter and forcing errors, and the inadequate model physics and/or resolution, the model predictions are usually of low quality. The LDAS, which merges the observation information (which includes in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing data) into a dynamic model (i.e., LSM), is expected to provide high-quality surface energy and water flux estimates with adequate spatial coverage and resolution for weather forecast. Because the LDAS can make maximum usage of the observation data that are derived from satellite remote sensing, it is expected to improve the land surface water and energy simulations, especially in the ungauged and poorly gauged regions. The Tibetan Plateau plays an important role in the progression of the Asian summer monsoon through its strong land-atmosphere interactions; it also influences circulations over China, the Northern Hemisphere and even the entire globe. Understanding the land-atmosphere interaction over the plateau is essential for weather forecast and climate change studies."

Both the LDAS and the SiB2 overestimated the sensible heat flux, which is partly due to that LSM does not accounting for the excess resistance that is important for the sensible heat flux calculation (Yang et al., 2009), and should be addressed in future research."

The soil moisture that was measured with an horizontally installed TDR probe at a 5-cm depth from the surface was used for the surface soil moisture validation.

Compared with the AMSR-E soil moisture retrievals, the LDAS simulations were comparable at the Gaize station, and they were superior at the Naqu station. For the whole domain inter-comparison, the results showed that the LDAS simulation of the soil moisture field was more realistic than the NCEP and SiB2 simulations and that the LDAS could estimate land surface states properly even in the regions where AMSR-E failed to cover and/or during the periods that the satellite did not overpass. For the surface energy fluxes, the LDAS estimated the latent heat flux with an acceptable accuracy (RMSE less than 35 W/m2), with a one-third reduction in the RMSE from the SiB2. For the 5-month whole plateau simulation, the LDAS produced a much more reasonable Bowen Ratio than the NCEP, and it also generated a clear contrast of the land surface status over the plateau, which was wet in the southeast and dry in the northwest, during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons."
