The precipitation data in China were obtained from the China Meteorological Administration-National Meteorological Information Center (http://data.cma.gov.cn/site/index.html).\n(2) Daily precipitation data in other countries in the Third Pole region, named as Foreign_daily.xlsx. The precipitation data in other countries were obtained from NCDC International Climatic Data Center - NOAA Satellite Information Service Center (http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/country), Pakistan Meteorological Administration, Nepal Meteorological Administration, etc.\nThere are seven variables in these two EXCEL data files: precipitation, corrected precipitation, correction factor, wind-induced loss, evaporation loss, wet loss, and trace precipitation. The detail characteristics of TPE stations were described in an EXCEL file either, named as \"TPE station and gauge type.xls\". The raw data has been strictly quality controlled by the relevant meteorological departments and has been applied in relevant academic papers.",

                "Accurate precipitation data and information are essential for understanding water resources and hydrometeorological processes at both regional and global scales. However, it is well known that precipitation amounts measured by means of precipitation gauges, especially snowfall, contain substantial negative biases. Systematic errors are particularly important with regard to these factors, because they affect all types of precipitation gauges, especially in cold regions. Research projects on the incompatibility of precipitation measurements and records have been conducted by way of gauge inter-comparison experiments by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These studies focus on the impact of wind, evaporation and other sources of errors in precipitation observations. Reliable precipitation is one of the most important variables in research into climate, glaciers, hydrology and ecosystems across the whole region. Atmospheric circulation patterns over the TPE region are characterized by the Indian monsoon (IM) in summer and the mid-latitude Westerlies in winter. Furthermore, a separate but shallow Tibetan Plateau monsoon (TPM) is also present, which is best defined at the 600hPa surface, originating from the thermal contrast between the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding lower altitude regions."
