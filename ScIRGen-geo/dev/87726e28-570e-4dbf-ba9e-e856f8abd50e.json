            "description": "The GSnow-CHINA Version 1.0 data set is a long-term snow depth data set developed using observations from the two GNSS networks constructed by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the China Earthquake Administration (CEA). We proposed a comprehensive framework using raw data of the complex GNSS station networks to automatically retrieve snow depth and control its quality. The data set includes snow depth of 24-hour, 12-hour, and 2-hour temporal resolutions if possible, for 80 sites from 2013 ~ 2022 over northern China (25° ~ 55° N, 70° ~ 140° E). The spatial footprint of the data set (i.e., ~1000m2) is distinguished from the current point-scale in-situ data or coarse-gridded data, which can be used as an independent data source for validation purposes. The data set is also useful for regional climate research and other meteorological and hydrological applications. The algorithm and the data files will be maintained and updated as more years of data become available in the future.",
            "instructions": "The snow depth data is stored in CSV format. The name of the file is \"SSSS_YYYY_HHh.txt\", where SSSS represnts the site name, YYYY represents the year, and HH represents the temporal resolution. For example, hltl_2019_24h.csv represents the 24-hour snow depth file for site hltl in the year 2019.",

                "Snow cover is one of the most active elements in the cryosphere, and the maximum snow area during winter nearly occupies 50 % of the total land surface area of the Northern Hemisphere (Frei and Robinson, 1999; Armstrong and Brodzik, 2001; Robinson et al., 1993). The snow change plays a significant role in the hydrological, ecological, and climatic systems (Henderson et al., 2018). Currently, snow cover products derived from optical remote-sensing data present high accuracy (Hao et al., 2021), but snow depth products show significant uncertainties. Snow depth can be measured at point-scale using ground-based ultrasonic snow depth sensors or laser snow depth sensors, and mainly include observations from meteorological stations, snow surveys, and hydrological stations (Kinar and Pomeroy, 2015). Large-scale snow depth can be retrieved from optical, passive microwave (PMW), and active remote-sensing observations (Shi and Dozier, 2000; Guerreiro et al., 2016; Leinss et al., 2014; Che et al., 2016), yet currently operational observations have shortcomings. Optical remote sensing is affected by solar radiation and cloud (Dai et al., 2017). The PMW remote sensing has coarse spatial footprints (>25 km), and the observations saturate in deep snow (>0.8 m) (Lievens et al., 2019). Active microwave remote sensing has a long revisiting period (>20 d) and high cost (Lievens et al., 2019). The available global/hemispheric/regional snow depth data sets are mainly derived from ground observations, microwave remote sensing, model simulations, and reanalysis (Xiao et al., 2020). Previous studies also demonstrated that current snow depth data sets and snow water equivalent data sets show significant inconsistencies and uncertainties, which limit their applications in climate change projections and simulations of hydrological processes (Xiao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Shao et al., 2022)."

                "The raw GNSS data used for snow depth retrieval are the daily Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) data derived directly from individual CMA/CEA GNSS sites. The observables for snow depth retrieval, i.e., satellite pseudorandom noise (PRN) numbers, observation time, satellite elevation angle, satellite azimuth angle, pseudorange, carrier phase (CP), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are extracted or calculated from the raw data. The Lomb–Scargle periodogram (LSP) analysis (Lomb, 1976) is executed on several snow-free days to determine the mean reflector heights for each GNSS satellite, each quadrant, and each GNSS frequency. A comprehensive evaluation of the quality of all the GNSS sites is done based on the data quality of the snow-free surface reflector heights in step (2), and the sites are divided into high-, medium-, and low-quality accordingly. For high- and medium-quality sites, the model for deriving daily reflector height is established, and the raw snow depth for each GNSS satellite, each quadrant, and each GNSS frequency is subsequently calculated as the difference value of the referenced height in step (2) and the height of this step. Several quality-control strategies are used to further improve the quality of the raw snow depth during the previous step, such as considering the penetration depth of soil, considering the vegetation effects, filtering of outliers, adding valid flags such as the standard error (SE) of snow depth and the number of PRNs used to calculate a specific snow depth value. Daily 24 h and sub-daily 12 h snow depths are derived for general high- and medium-quality GNSS sites, and snow depths of finer resolution are additionally derived for several GPS/GLONASS compatible sites. The GSnow-CHINA v1.0 data set is evaluated using the PMW product and the in situ measurements. The advantages and limitations of the produced data set are further analyzed to provide supportive information for future method improvement or data set extension."

The data set also has high external consistency with the in situ measurements and the passive microwave (PMW) product, with a consistent illustration of the interannual snow depth variability. Additionally, the result show the potential of GNSS to derive hourly snow depth observations for better monitoring of snow disasters.
