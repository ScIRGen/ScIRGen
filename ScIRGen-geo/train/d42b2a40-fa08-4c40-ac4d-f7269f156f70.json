            "description": "From September 5 to September 26, 2020, the bird research team of the Institute of zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, composed of eight people, including Zhang Dezhi, the sub project leader, respectively inspected yadonggou, Yadong County, Xigaze City, chentanggou, Dingjie County, and zhangmugou, Nyalam County, Himalayan region, and successfully completed this year's field research. The observation data is composed of bird species names, observation sites and observation time, including not only the Himalayan region, but also a small number of sites. The collected bird species data were also incorporated into the data set. The corresponding photos and videos were collected into the data set of the animal special topic \"the second Qinghai Tibet scientific research plateau animal diversity protection and sustainable use (2019qzk0501) photo and video (2020)\".",

                    "Answer": "The documentation of bird species, observation locations, and times during Himalayan field surveys is essential to understand the biodiversity of the region and to assess the distribution and abundance of avian species. This information contributes to broader ecological and conservation goals by providing baseline data necessary for monitoring changes in bird populations over time, understanding habitat requirements, and informing strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of high-altitude ecosystems. Moreover, integrating these observations with photographs and videos enhances the richness of the dataset, supporting detailed ecological studies and public awareness efforts.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection involves a team conducting field surveys in specific locations in the Himalayan region, such as Yadong Valley, Chentang Valley, and Zhangmu Valley. The collected data includes bird species names, observation locations, and times. This data is integrated into a dataset that also encompasses photographs and videos compiled into a dedicated collection on high-altitude animal diversity protection.",
