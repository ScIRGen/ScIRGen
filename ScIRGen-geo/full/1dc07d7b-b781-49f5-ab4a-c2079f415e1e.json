            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with Landsat TM was obtained in the A'rou foci experimental area on Jul. 22, 2008. The stellera coverage was mainly measured by photo taking.\n     (1) Stellera coverage was measured by photo taking in 10 quadrates (51m×51m). Each quadrate was divided into 17×17 subsites, with each one spanning a 3×3 m2 plot. Only corner points of each subsite were chosen and 324 photos were taken for each quadrate. Photos were taken by Nikon D80 with a lens of 18-135mm, shooting straight downwards at the height of 1.5m.\n     (2) quadrates investigation including GPS by GARMIN GPS 76, species by manual cognition, the plant number by manual work, the height by the measuring tape repeated 4-5 times, the coverage by manual work (compartmentalizing 0.5m×0.5m into 100 to see the percentage the stellera takes) and the biomass (samples from 0.5m×0.5m) by green weight and dry weight. Data were archived in Excel format. \n     The dataset includes TM images, quadrate coverage investigation photos, GPS positions, coverage files and investigation tables.",

Using a standard camera like the Nikon D80 with an 18-135mm lens, photographs are taken from a height of 1.5 meters directly downward at the corners of each grid, capturing a total of 324 images per sample plot. The photographic data helps in verifying satellite data for accurate cover estimates.",

In addition, sampling using GPS for accurate location recording, manual species identification, plant counting, and biomass measurement through direct weighing and drying methods enable comprehensive data collection.",
