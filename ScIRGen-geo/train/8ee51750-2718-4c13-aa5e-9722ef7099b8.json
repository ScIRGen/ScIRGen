                "The flow regime change of rivers, especially transboundary rivers, affected by reservoir regulations is evident worldwide and has received much attention. Investigating dam-induced flow regime alterations is essential for understanding potential adverse downstream effects and facilitating dialogue around coordinated water use in transboundary basins, such as the Lancang River Basin (LRB). The spatial and temporal patterns of hydrological processes and water availability are profoundly changing at regional and global scales under the dual impacts of climate change and human activities. Streamflow is a crucial element in understanding hydrological processes, and water resource management. Climate change can affect streamflow in several ways. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that climate change has led to an increase in frequency and severity of extreme floods and droughts, which seriously threaten human life and property. On the other hand, infrastructure, such as dams and reservoirs, has significantly changed the flow regime. Dams are primarily constructed to regulate the river discharge. Additionally, the reservoirs behind dams play an important role in freshwater resource control. Reservoir construction and management obviously alter natural flow regimes intending to play a significant role in regional socioeconomic development within the river basin and considerably influence downstream ecological systems. Given the background of climate change and population growth, concerns have been raised about the negative impact of reservoir construction on the ecological environment and water resources in downstream countries, especially in developing countries. In terms of environmental effects, dams and reservoirs substantially alter the natural hydrological regime, which leads to numerous physical and ecological impacts on freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems and their dependent species. Beyond flow alterations, dams also fragment aquatic habitats, such as blocking the movement of species and the delivery of nutrients and sediments downstream, which can severely disrupt natural riverine production systems - especially fisheries, flood-recession agriculture, and dry-season grazing. In the case of regulated transboundary rivers, water management during extreme events is a complex issue requiring international coordination. The Lancang River Basin (LRB) is a good example of this complexity. The basin has undergone rapid development of its hydropower potential during the past three decades, which has dramatically changed hydrological processes and sediment budget, thus degrading river ecosystems and threatening riparian communities. For example, Doan et al. (2020) pointed out that the sediment trapping in the Lancang cascade dams decreased the sediment budget in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta by 74.1 %, thereby causing severe riverbed incisions. Beyond sediment impeding, flow regulation has been a major concern for countries along the route, especially when encountering extreme weather conditions (extreme drought or flood). Then, how do climate change and reservoir regulation affect outbound release in the Lancang River Basin? It is essential to study upstream reservoir operation (e.g., reservoir inflow, storage, and outflow), to understand the variation in the flow regime over the past 20 years and to better allocate water resources. Although the most recently constructed dams are equipped with sophisticated in-situ monitoring systems to obtain reservoir data such as inflow, storage, and outflow, and although reservoir operational rules are in place, obtaining long-term and consistent records is difficult due to a lack of data-sharing mechanisms and geopolitical concerns in transboundary river basins. Thus, leveraging free and open Earth observation (EO) datasets to reconstruct flow regimes at the regional scale is an ongoing effort owing to the urgency of ensuring more effective cross-boundary cooperation and management of water-energy resources."

                "This study explored the value of combining several types of satellite Earth observation (EO) datasets that monitor different water balance components to constrain the parameter space of lumped conceptual hydrological models. To address these questions within the basin, we use WSE observations derived from the state-of-the-art Sentinel-3 and SWE observations developed by a novel algorithm for fusing optical and SAR data to monitor cascade reservoir operation in the LRB."

            "challenges": [
                "The implementation of second approach in the LRB remains challenging, despite being promising owing to uncertainties in reservoir storage monitoring and inflow simulation. To apply this method, the first task is to estimate the reservoir storage variations, which can be achieved by fitting the imagery-derived SWE and altimetry-derived WSE curves. However, the availability of data is challenging. Although Landsat provides a long time series for WSE monitoring, data quality may deteriorate due to clouds and faulty sensors. Reservoir storage changes can be easily calculated by multiplying the WSE changes with a fixed mean reservoir SWE. Nonetheless, this method outperforms the other global reservoir operation schemes. However, assuming a fixed value of reservoir SWE introduces uncertainties, contradicting the fact that reservoir SWE in the LRB fluctuates significantly with the season. On the other hand, satellite altimetry observations are not only subject to external disturbances in narrow reservoirs in mountain valleys but are also limited by sparse spatial coverage and long revisit times."

We obtained the regulated flow regime from satellite altimetry reservoir level observations. Specifically, reservoir water storage changes were first estimated using satellite imagery and altimetry datasets. Then, storage changes were combined with hydrological model simulations of reservoir inflow to estimate the regulated flow regime downstream."

                "Our results showed that integrated hydrological modeling combined with EO datasets exhibited better overall performance. Continuous warming and drying of the LRB resulted in a decrease in discharge of approximately 47 %. By comparing the simulated natural and regulated flow regimes, we revealed the pivotal role of the Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs in regulating natural flows. The wet season shortens (approximately 45 days), the flood peak flattens, and the low flow in the dry season has primarily increased. The two reservoirs attenuated 50 % of the flood peaks in the wet seasons and mitigated droughts by releasing up to 100 % of the natural flows in the dry seasons at the China–Laos border. Overall, these results enhance the understanding of upper reservoir operation, and the approaches can be applied to studies of dammed basins under climate change scenarios when knowledge of the upstream area is limited."
