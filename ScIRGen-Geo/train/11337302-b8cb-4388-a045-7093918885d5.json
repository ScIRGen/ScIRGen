            "description": "This data set describes the temporal and spatial distribution of runoff and evapotranspiration for the headwater of seven river basins in the Tibetan Plateau under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. We utilized an LSTM-grid model trained with inputs from an observation-constrained distributed cryosphere-hydrology model (WEB-DHM), along with meteorological data from ISIMIP3b (GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, and UKESM1-0-LL) and glacier mass balance data (NSIDC) to generate the runoff and evapotranspiration data. The time range is 2018-2100 at a monthly scale, the spatial resolution is 0.25-degree. ",

To achieve this, we utilized data generated by the WEB‐DHM, which operates on the fundamental principles of water and energy balance. The output data from WEB‐DHM have undergone calibration with observed discharge data from hydrological stations, resulting in high accuracy and reliability. This model integrates a three‐layer energy balance snow module and frozen ground parameterization. Notably, it employs enthalpy instead of temperature to establish the energy equation. Over its extensive development history, the WEB‐DHM has consistently demonstrated its reliability in describing cryosphere‐hydrological processes in alpine glacier regions. It has generated dependable, high‐precision runoff and ET data for the seven major rivers in the TP, forming crucial inputs for this study. The meteorological data, including precipitation (denoted as P) and temperature (denoted as T), utilized in this study were sourced from ISIMIP3b (the Inter‐Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project). These data sets represent bias‐corrected downscaled future climate data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). For this research, a total of five general circulation models (GCMs) were employed, namely GFDL‐ESM4, IPSL‐CM6A‐LR, MPI‐ESM1‐2‐HR, MRI‐ESM2‐0, and UKESM1‐0‐LL. The glacier area data utilized in this study were sourced from The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI), a comprehensive global digital data set of glacier outlines. In this study, the total glacier mass changes (total_GMC) for a 0.25‐degree model grid (or a river basin), can be derived by totaling the original glacier mass balance data divided by the area of a grid cell (or a river basin). Here, the original glacier mass balance data is obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, which is produced by the Python Glacier Evolution Model."

Intra‐annual projections indicated notable increases in spring runoff, especially in basins where glacier meltwater significantly contributes to runoff. Additionally, the LSTM‐grid model aptly captures the runoff changes before and after the turning points of glacier melting, highlighting the growing influence of precipitation on runoff after reaching the maximum total_GMC."
