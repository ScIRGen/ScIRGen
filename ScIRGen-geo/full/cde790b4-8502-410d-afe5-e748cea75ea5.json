            "description": "Timely and accurate ISA monitoring is crucial for urban planning and sustainable social development. The advancement of remote sensing technology has driven the development of global ISA mapping towards high spatial and temporal resolution. To address the issues of omissions and false alarms in ISA, we propose a new global continuous time series ISA mapping method and generate a new 30-m global long time series ISA product (GISA). Specifically, for ISA omissions, we proposed a multi temporal CCDC algorithm that takes into account the addition of ISA gain. For the false alarms, we proposed a multi-scale iterative global false alarm automatic removal algorithm. Based on independent test data, the overall accuracy of GISA reached 93.38%, with an omission rate of 10.11% and a false alarm rate of 3.37%. GISA fills the gaps in global ISA by removing false alarms at different scales, providing more accurate data for further understanding the global urbanization process.",
