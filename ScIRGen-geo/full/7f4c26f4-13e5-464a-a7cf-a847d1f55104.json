                "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a convenient geophysical technique for active-layer soil moisture detection in permafrost regions, which is theoretically based on the petrophysical relationship between soil moisture (θ) and the soil dielectric constant (ε). The active layer is defined as the layer of ground that is subject to seasonal thawing and freezing in areas underlain by permafrost. It plays a vital role in hydrological processes, heat flux exchanges between ground and air, as well as land surface modeling. Moreover, it can also affect carbon cycles, terrestrial ecosystems, and permafrost region ground engineering. The principal factors which influence the spatial variation of active-layer thickness are ground surface soil temperature, soil moisture, and thermal conductivity within the active layer. At present, active-layer soil moisture was often monitored with the buried time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor or acquired through traditional gravimetric methods with active-layer profile soil samples."

By neglecting the influence of the soil matrix dielectric constant and soil porosity variations on soil moisture estimation at the regional scale, a simple active-layer soil moisture calibration curve, named CRIM, which is suitable for the Qinghai–Tibet plateau permafrost regions, was established. To avoid this shortage, a direct linear fitting calibration equation, named as υ-fitting, was acquired based on the statistical relationship between the active-layer soil moisture and GPR velocity with our field-investigated data set."
