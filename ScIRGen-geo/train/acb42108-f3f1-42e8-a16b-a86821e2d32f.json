Nature Communications, 12, 4667. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25026-3. This dataset includes global urban land information under different shared socioeconomic pathways from 2020 to 2070. The production process of this dataset mainly includes: (1) establishing a linear regression model based on the urban land data (downloaded from https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.892684) and urban population data from 1992 to 2016 to calculate the future urban land demand; (2) using the LUSD-urban model to simulate the spatial distribution of urban land. The dataset can support the assessment of effects of future global urban expansion.",

However, the accuracy of these predictions depends on the quality and representativeness of historical data and population trends. This approach may result in oversimplification if it fails to account for non-linear dynamics, unexpected changes in urban planning policies, or socio-economic disruptions. It may also influence planning and resource allocation strategies, potentially affecting urban sustainability and resilience.",
