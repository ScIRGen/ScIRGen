            "description": "The data set includes major and trace elements, whole rock Sr – Nd isotope, zircon Hf-O isotope and zircon U-Pb age data of granodiorite. The samples were collected from the granodiorite in the Jiacuo area of the Southern Qiangtang block, central Tibet. Zircon U-Pb dating data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The whole rock Sr – Nd isotopes were obtained by sample separation and purification multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Hf isotopes of zircons were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Through the data obtained, we can define the age, origin and deep dynamic mechanism of magmatism in the region, and provide an understanding of the Jurassic tectonic background of the South Qiangtang block.",
