            "description": "The dataset is the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) products of 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the FVC equation which is based on dimidiate pixel model of NDVI.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow.FVC is an important ecological parameter, which is widely used in ecological environmnet monitoring .\n",
            "instructions": "1)File name rules: the FVC result of each scense is stored in a floder including the FVC band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-FVC;the FVC is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-FVC.TIF\". 2)How to use the dataset:the FVC results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the unit of the FVC results is %, for exmaple the value is 80, that means the fractional vegetation is 80%, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.\n",

                    "Answer": "The methodology of using NDVI-based pixel dichotomy models to derive vegetation fractional cover (FVC) indicates that satellite data interpretation for ecological monitoring involves complex models to accurately reflect ground conditions. These models must effectively separate vegetation signals from other land cover types using spectral indices like NDVI, which can be influenced by factors such as cloud cover, atmospheric conditions, and mixed pixels. The process also requires quality assurance measures to account for cloud and snow presence, demonstrating the need for thorough data processing to ensure the reliability and usability of ecological monitoring data.",

This method, when applied to remote sensing datasets, can improve the accuracy of vegetation monitoring and analysis. However, challenges may arise in accurately identifying and classifying cloud and snow cover, which necessitates the production of quality assurance files to ensure data reliability. These models contribute significantly to ecological environment monitoring and vegetation growth studies.",
