            "description": "The dataset contains the city and town location data, the urban population data, and the built-up land area data for the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 1990 to 2020. The city and town location data are the locations of administrative centers in provinces, cities, counties, and towns of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau in 2018, collected from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGSNRR). The urban population data covers the total population and urban population at the municipal level, as well as the total population information at the county level. The municipal-level population data are collected from China’s 4th to the 7th national censuses. Among the county-level population data, those for 1990-2010 come from China’s county-level population data compiled by Song et al., and those for 2020 come from the 7th national census of China. The built-up land area data are statistical information at the county level, and the data source is the sub-class urban built-up land of China’s Land Use/cover Dataset (CLUD) from IGSNRR.",

                    "Answer": "Urban population data collection involves obtaining statistics from multiple national population censuses, specifically the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh censuses at the city level. For county-level population data from 1990 to 2010, historical census data collected by researchers like Song Dongdong and others are used. The 2020 county-level population data are sourced from the seventh national census. Verification involves cross-referencing these data with authoritative sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.",

These sources provided information on urban distribution, urban population, and built-up area sizes over time.",
