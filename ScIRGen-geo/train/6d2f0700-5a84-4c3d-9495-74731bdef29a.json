            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Sidaoqiao superstation eddy covariance system (EC) in the downstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2019. The site (101.1374° E, 42.0012° N) was located in the Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region . The elevation is 873 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3.2 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500A) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. Data during July 15 to 25 and September 12 to 28, 2019 were missing due to the eddy covariance system debugging.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

It is set up at a height of 8 meters and utilizes a sampling frequency of 10Hz. The instrument setup includes a CSAT3 sonic anemometer and a Li7500 CO2/H2O analyzer, which are positioned 15cm apart, oriented towards true north. The data from these instruments undergo processing steps like outlier removal, time lag correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, virtual temperature correction, and density correction using Eddypro software, resulting in quality-assessed 30-minute flux data.",

Quality evaluation is performed based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics. Additionally, the processing includes specific selection criteria, like excluding data from faulty instruments, or when precipitation affects the data, and requires less than 10% missing data in each 30-minute segment. This rigorous approach ensures high-quality data but might differ from other methods which may not include such detailed corrections and quality assessments.",

This can lead to a more accurate representation of surface processes, since unstable or turbulent conditions can introduce errors. However, it may also result in the exclusion of a significant amount of data, especially during periods with adverse conditions, which could impact the overall dataset comprehensiveness.",

These measurements aim to understand the energy and mass exchange processes over the Tamarix surface in the downstream area of the Heihe River Basin. Additionally, the data is processed for quality assurance and to correct for various potential errors, allowing for reliable analysis of the atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics, which are crucial for understanding the local climate and ecosystem dynamics.",

Additionally, quality evaluation of flux values is conducted, focusing on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC) testing. The data is further filtered by removing erroneous data from the instruments, excluding data around precipitation events, and discarding data with more than 10% missing in every 30-minute interval. The final dataset is processed into 30-minute averages using Eddypro software.",
