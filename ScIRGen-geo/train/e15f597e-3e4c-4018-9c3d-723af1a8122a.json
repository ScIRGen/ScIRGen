            "description": "LA-ICP-MS zircon dating, XRF and ICP-MS elemental geochemical analysis and tims SR-Nd-Pb isotopic composition show that: Linglong gold deposit in Jiaobei area and Kunyushan Wendeng area in Sulu orogenic belt are mainly composed of diabase and diorite, SiO2 content varies from 45.5 wt% to 60.7 wt%, zircon U-Pb age is ~ 108-118 ma. These intermediate basic dikes are characterized by high-k calc alkaline and shoshonitic, high MgO and MgO, Cr and Ni contents. In Jiaobei area, the mafic dikes are mainly diabase, lamprophyre and diorite, and the SiO2 content is slightly lower than that of the mafic dikes exposed in Sulu orogenic belt, while the MgO content is relatively high. These intermediate basic dikes are characterized by trace element composition of island arc magmatic rocks, enriched in lile, LREE and Pb, and depleted in high field strength elements such as Nb and TA. The intermediate basic dikes in the two areas all have enriched SR nd Pb isotopic compositions. However, compared with the Sulu orogenic belt, the basic dikes in Jiaobei area have more enriched Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions. The data comes from the scientific research project \"deep process and resource effect of major geological events in Yanshanian period\" (2016YFC0600404), a national key research and development plan.",

It involves laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which is used to measure the isotopic composition of zircon crystals. In the context of geological data collection, it provides precise age determinations, such as the ~108-118 Ma zircon U-Pb ages mentioned for the intermediate-basic dykes in the Jiaodong Peninsula.",
