The input variables include the net longwave radiation, net shortwave radiation, surface skin temperature, air temperature, air specific humidity and soil moisture from the GLDAS dataset, as well as the fractional vegetation coverage from GLASS dataset, etc. The time span of this dataset is from 1978 to 2018, and the spatial scope is the “One belt, one road” key area of Asia. The study area covers an area of 1,469,400 square kilometers, and contains ET data for the whole basin and 33 sub-basins of the \"One Belt, One Road\" key basins in Asia. This dataset can be used as a reference for the study of large-scale long-term ET changes and climate change analysis in the “One belt, one road” key basins region. The unit of the actual ET is mm/year, the temporal resolution is yearly and the spatial resolution is in 0.25°. The data type is in NetCDF format.",

                "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant component of the global hydrological and energy cycle, reflecting water exchange between land and atmosphere. An accurate estimation of ET is required in numerous engineering applications, such as agriculture and water resource management. However, it is the most difficult component to measure in the hydrological cycle. Progress has been made in monitoring techniques over the past decades, including lysimeters, neutron scattering, eddy covariance (EC), and large-aperture scintillometers. However, direct observations of ET are temporally discontinuous and horizontally inhomogeneous. In recent years, a variety of remote sensing-based ET products have been developed, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS). However, substantial uncertainty exists among these products owing to the different model algorithms, model structures, and inputs. Traditional methods, such as bulk transfer, energy balance-based models, and combination methods (i.e., Penman-Monteith), still face challenges in accurately estimating ET across a range of spatiotemporal scales. Therefore, an efficient ET model with fewer variable inputs is required to fulfill the demands of diverse applications. In recent years, a novel approach based on the maximum entropy production (MEP) theory has provided a new solution for ET modeling. The MEP model was formulated by combining non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Bayesian probability, information theory, and boundary-layer turbulence theory."

In this study, we present an open-source R package of the MEP model (named “RMEP”) to conduct a long-term global analysis of ET during 1978 – 2018."

                "However, large uncertainties in the present global ET products originate from the distinct model structures, assumptions, and inputs. However, direct observations of ET are temporally discontinuous and horizontally inhomogeneous. However, substantial uncertainty exists among these products owing to the different model algorithms, model structures, and inputs. These methods require several variables and model parameters, including wind speed, temperature, humidity profiles, vegetation characteristics, and aerodynamic resistance, which may induce large uncertainties in ET estimation. The model has been successfully applied to estimate ET at the site level; however, the model performance varied in different studies. Nevertheless, studies focusing on evaluating the overall ET across various land covers are lacking, especially at a global scale. The only attempt at a global study using the MEP model was conducted by Huang et al., wherein the surface energy budgets were revisited; however, the study failed to verify the ET because of the coarse spatial resolution and the 10-year temporal coverage that was insufficient to reveal long-term ET variations."

The overall performance of MEP was evaluated across various land covers, and a higher ET accuracy was revealed for forestlands, wetlands, and cropland land covers. The MEP-derived ET trend corresponded well with the EC-observed ET trend, and the results indicated that the global land ET declined continuously during 1999 – 2018. Overall, the MEP model provided an accurate ET estimate with parsimonious inputs, which outperformed the GLDAS-Noah ET product and can serve as a global analytical method for the hydrological cycle and climate change."
