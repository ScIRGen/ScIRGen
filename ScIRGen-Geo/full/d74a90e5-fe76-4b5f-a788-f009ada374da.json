      "description": "The change of urban built-up area reflects the development of the city, so the information extraction of the change process of built-up area is an important prerequisite for the study of urban development and regional economy. This data set contains the annual change information of the built-up area of key nodes from 1985 to 2018, with a resolution of 30m. Using the combined method of supervision classification and time consistency check, the three key nodes of Hambantota, Yangon and Dhaka are used as the study area to determine the change from the non-built-up area to the built-up area. Pixels in built-up areas are defined as more than 50% impervious. The year of transition (from non-built-up area to built-up area) can be identified from the pixel value, ranging from 34 (year: 1985) to 1 (year: 2018). For example, the built-up area in 1990 can be displayed with a pixel value greater than 29. After monotonous conversion from non-built-up area to built-up area, the data set is consistent in time.",

        "Artiﬁcial impervious areas are predominant indicators of human settlements. Timely, accurate, and frequent information on artiﬁcial impervious areas is critical to understanding the process of urbanization and land use/cover change, as well as of their impacts on the environment and biodiversity. The change of global artiﬁcial impervious area (GAIA) is a critical indicator for understanding the impact of global urbanization on human society and the environment. Artiﬁcial impervious areas are mainly man-made structures that are composed of any material that impedes or prevents natural inﬁltration of water into the soil. As an important proxy to built-up areas in the world, artiﬁcial impervious areas play a critical role in controlling the ﬂows of energy and materials and reﬂecting various levels of human activities. The rapid urban growth worldwide has signiﬁcant local and tele-connected impacts on biodiversity loss, agricultural production, and environmental quality, all of which ﬁnally inﬂuence human health and well-being. Although studies of mapping urban built-up areas and artiﬁcial impervious areas using satellite observations started more than four decades ago, earlier efforts were mainly made at the local scale. Since 2005, the advent of freely accessible satellite data made it possible to map urban extent and artiﬁcial impervious areas at the global scale. Despite many existing efforts in mapping GAIA, annual maps covering a relatively long period of time (i.e., more than 30 years) do not exist. In fact, accurate annual global land cover information including GAIA is needed in global climate change studies."

        "We developed an automatic mapping procedure on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to implement the planetary-scale mapping of annual artiﬁcial impervious areas at a 30-m resolution from 1985 to 2018. Therefore, in this research, we divided the whole world into arid areas and non-arid areas according to the global biome map. For non-arid areas, we used the same approach as in our previous studies. In arid regions, we developed an improved algorithm by including additional constraints to mitigate the overestimation caused by spectral confusion between impervious areas and bare lands. To improve the mapping eﬃciency on the GEE, we divided the whole world into 583 geographical grids (3.5º×3.5°), of which 155 grids contain arid biomes. The mapping procedures were implemented in all grids, using the full archive of Landsat time series images."

These sample units (i.e., around 100 per grid) were collected from earlier Landsat images (i.e., near or around the start year of 1985) in reference with higher resolution images in Google Earth; thus they can be spatially and temporally extended to enrich the sample size and applied to subsequent years."
