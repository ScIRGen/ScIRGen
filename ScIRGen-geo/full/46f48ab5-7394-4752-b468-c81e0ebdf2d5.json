            "description": "Through the archaeological investigation and excavation of Xingyi Site, Adong sarcophagus Tomb, Haibaoshan Site, Qugong, Kongsangqiao, Khog Gzung, Klu lding, La phob, RGu shang, Kha lding, A sgang rong, Bya mo kha, Nying khri, Nyi khri, Baguorao, RDo phug, Jialama, Liena and other Neolithic-Bronze Age sites, basic information such as latitude and longitude, elevation, cultural attributes and cultural relics of the sites have been obtained. In addition, through scientific collection, identification and laboratory analysis of plant and animal remains in the process of site investigation and excavation, a batch of site carbon 14th-century data and charcoal identification data were obtained. At the same time, the microscopic identification of tree species from different cultural layers of carboniferous was conducted at the Zonggri Site (4039-4631 BP), and the results of tree charcoal identification from 16 archaeological sites at 5200-2600 BP in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau were combined with the reported multi-discipline evidence. At the same time, the relevant faunal and flora remains and archaeological background in the Tibet Plateau and neighbouring areas are sorted out, revealing the important role that the east margin of Tibetan Plateau played in the southward spread of prehistoric culture and agriculture in East Asia. Foxtail and broomcorn millet originated from North China was introduced into the hinterland of Tibetan Plateau first through this north-south channel. Wheat and barley originated from Southwest Asia were introduced onto the plateau through the northern South Asia. Multiple evidences indicate that the Eastern and Western cultures arrived in Lhasa and Niyang Valleys located in the hearland of Tibetan Plateau in the Neolithic Age. The intercultural communications not only flourished the prehistoric Tibetan Plateau but also laid the foundation for the later ‘Highland Silk Road’. To explore the utilization history of fruit trees in the late Neolithic Age and the Bronze Age in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and its relationship with survival strategies. The present archaeobotanical evidence from five sites (dating from the late first millennium BC and the early first millennium AD) located in the cold-arid landscape of western Tibet. The data indicate that barley was widely grown in this region by c. 400 BC but probably fulfilled differing roles within local ecological constraints on cultivation. ",

                    "Answer": "A comprehensive data collection method involves conducting archaeological surveys and excavations at Neolithic to Bronze Age sites such as Xingyi, A Dong Stone Coffin Tomb, and others. The method includes gathering basic site information like latitude, longitude, elevation, cultural attributes, and relics. Additionally, it involves scientifically collecting, identifying, and conducting laboratory analyses on plant and animal remains samples, resulting in radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification data. For example, microscopic identification of tree species from charcoal fragments at the Zongri site, dating between 4039-4631 BP, was performed. The results are integrated with multidisciplinary evidence to explore the history of fruit tree utilization and its relation to survival strategies in the region. The method also organizes related archaeobotanical evidence and cultural backgrounds, revealing significant agricultural and cultural transmission pathways in the early history of the Tibetan Plateau.",

This process involves collecting samples during site surveys and excavations, identifying the species or types of remains, and conducting laboratory analyses to obtain data such as radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification. These analyses help to understand the utilization of plant and animal resources, which, in turn, provides insights into the subsistence strategies and cultural practices of past human populations in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The identified plant and animal remains suggest that the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau served as an important corridor for the north-to-south spread of agriculture and culture, with millet originating from northern China and barley and wheat from Western Asia spreading into the plateau. This indicates a convergence of Eastern and Western cultures during the Neolithic period, enriching the local prehistoric culture and laying the groundwork for the later development of the Silk Road.",

The collection process involved the scientific gathering, identification, and laboratory analysis of plant and animal remains, including carbon dating and charcoal identification, along with integrating multi-disciplinary evidence to explore the historical use of fruit trees and survival strategies in the region.",

                    "Answer": "Employing diverse archaeological excavation techniques could lead to more accurate and comprehensive data regarding plant and animal resource utilization in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas during the Neolithic to Bronze Age. This is because different techniques may reveal various types of evidence, such as carbon dating, charcoal identification, and plant residue analysis, which can help reconstruct the history of agricultural and cultural developments in the region. These findings can also illuminate the spread of early agriculture and cultural exchanges between the East and West, influencing our understanding of prehistoric culture and the eventual establishment of trade routes like the Silk Road.",
