            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Huailai station eddy covariance system (EC) from January 1 to December 31 in 2021. The site (115.7880° E, 40.3491°N) was located in the maize surface, near Donghuayuan town of Huailai city in Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The EC was installed at a height of 5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500A) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC) (class 1 to 9). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. \nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2013) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

Additionally, the data undergoes quality evaluation based on atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC). The dataset is then filtered to remove erroneous data from instrument faults, data around precipitation events, data with more than 10% missing in each 30-minute interval of original 10Hz data, and nighttime data with weak turbulence (u* less than 0.1m/s).",

                    "Answer": "Data errors during the collection of surface flux and meteorological elements using eddy covariance systems can be caused by instrument malfunctions, precipitation events, and data gaps. These errors are typically addressed through post-processing steps such as outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic virtual temperature correction, and density correction. Additionally, data quality is assessed based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics, with data being filtered for errors, rainfall, data gaps, and weak turbulence.",

Data is initially collected at a frequency of 10Hz and then post-processed using Eddypro software to produce 30-minute averaged data. Key steps in post-processing include removing outliers, correcting for time delays, performing coordinate rotations (secondary coordinate rotation), applying frequency response corrections, ultrasonic virtual temperature corrections, and density corrections (WPL correction). The processed data is then quality-checked for atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics. Further filtering is done by removing data from instrument errors, periods around precipitation events, data missing more than 10% within each 30-minute interval, and nocturnal weak turbulence data (with friction velocity u* less than 0.1 m/s).",
