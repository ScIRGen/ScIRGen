            "description": "This data set mainly includes whole rock major and trace geochemical data and whole rock SR Nd isotopic data of adakitic rocks in western Liaoning Province. The main element geochemical data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element geochemical data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the whole rock Sr-Nd isotopic data were obtained by TIMS test. All the above data have been published in the international authoritative geoscience Journal Lithos, and the data are true, effective, complete and reliable. Through the analysis and Simulation of this set of data, we can establish the genetic model of continental adakitic rocks and constrain the tectonic background model of their formation.",

XRF provides robust analysis of major elements, ICP-MS offers precise measurements of trace elements, and TIMS delivers accurate isotopic data. This combination ensures a thorough understanding of the geochemical composition, leading to more accurate modeling of the formation and tectonic background of adakitic rocks.",

This is achieved through analysis and simulation of the dataset, which includes whole-rock major and trace geochemical data, as well as whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic data obtained through XRF, ICP-MS, and TIMS testing. The dataset has been validated and published in a reputable geological journal, ensuring its reliability and completeness.",
