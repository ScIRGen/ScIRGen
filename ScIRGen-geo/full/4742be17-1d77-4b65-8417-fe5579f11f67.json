            "description": "A new species, Yuomys robustus of the ctenodactyloid rodent Yuomys, is described in the paper. It is from the Western margin of the Ordos Basin District in eastern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China. Yuomys robustus is characterized by a combination of features: large size, high tooth crown, having a postparacrista on M2 and lacking hypocone on P4. We also emended the diagnosis of type species of Yuomys, Y. cavioides. It is characterized by the absence of hypocone on P4, having a distinct ridge connecting the metaconule to the protocone on M1–M3, a postparacrista on M1, a mesostyle on M2, and a small ridge or spur on the mesial side of the protoloph on P4 and M1; the hypoconid smaller than the protoconid and is elongated, the paraconid absent and the mesostylid faintly visible on p4, but well developed on m1–m3; the talonid basin, sinusid, and posteroflexid are large and open on lower cheek teeth. The occurrence of Lophiomeryx angarae in the same stratigraphic layer as Y. robustus indicates that the horizon is possibly\nlate Eocene in age, not early Oligocene as suggested by previous workers. Body mass estimations of Y. cavioides, Y. eleganes, and Y. robustus show that their weights are roughly in the range of 485–880 g, which is in between those of extant Myospalax and Ratufa. From the middle Eocene to the late Eocene, Yuomys exhibited a trend of gradually enlarging the cheek teeth, and increasing the tooth crown height and body mass.",

                    "Question": "What does 'systematic revision' mean in the context of paleontological research?",
                    "Answer": "Systematic revision in paleontological research refers to the process of re-evaluating previously identified fossil specimens to clarify their classification, characteristics, and evolutionary relationships. This involves a detailed examination of the fossil's features, comparison with other known specimens, and possibly redefining its taxonomic placement. In the context of the field described, it includes the re-examination of previously reported species of the genus Yushumys, refining the understanding of their genus and species characteristics.",

                    "Answer": "The discovery and identification of new rodent fossil species, such as the newly identified robust Yu mouse, in sedimentary layers from the late Eocene can be attributed to a combination of factors. These include the detailed investigation of sedimentary development and tectonic uplift, which led to the identification of specific geological formations like the Si Kouzi Formation-Qingshuiying Formation. The morphological characteristics of the fossils, such as the largest size, highest tooth crown, and robust tooth cusps and ridges among all known Yu mouse species, also play a crucial role. Additionally, the presence of the An's ridge tooth chevrotain, whose size and morphology closely resemble those from the Mongolian Ardyn Obo site, further supports the identification of late Eocene strata, suggesting a correlation in fossil layers.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goal of collecting and analyzing fossil data in this context is to understand the evolutionary trends and diversity of Eocene rodent species, specifically the Yuomys genus, in the Eurasian region. This includes exploring changes in physical characteristics such as the size of cheek teeth, crown height, and body weight over time. Additionally, these findings contribute to the stratigraphic dating of Paleogene mammalian faunas in China and provide insights into the environmental and ecological conditions of the period, enhancing the understanding of species distribution and geological developments in the region.",
