            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Linze grassland foci experimental area on May 30, 2008. WiDAS, composed of four CCD cameras, one mid-infrared thermal imager (AGEMA 550), and one infrared thermal imager (S60), can acquire CCD, MIR and TIR band data. \n    The simultaneous ground data included the land surface temperature measured by the  hand-held infrared thermometer in the reed plot A, the saline plots B and C, the alfalfa plot D and the barley plot E, the maximum of which were 120m×120m and the minimum were 30m×30m, and soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying measured by the cutting ring and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm measured by the probe thermometer in plot A, B and C; the soil temperature, soil moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity measured by the POGO soil sensor, and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm measured by the probe thermometer in plot D and E.\n    See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",
