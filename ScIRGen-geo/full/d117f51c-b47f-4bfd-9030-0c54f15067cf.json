                "There are about 1,200 lakes (>1 km2) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP; Zhang, Yao, Xie, Qin, et al., 2014), and many studies have shown that lake ice phenology (i.e., the timing of freezeup, breakup, and duration of ice cover) responds well to climatic and environmental changes (Brown & Duguay, 2010; Weber et al., 2016). As “the Third Pole of the Earth,” the TP is very sensitive to global climate change (Kang et al., 2010; Liu & Chen, 2000; Qiu, 2008). Changes in air and water surface temperatures related to climatic changes are important factors in the lake ice phenology changes (Adrian et al., 2009; Dörnhöfer & Oppelt, 2016; Yao et al., 2016; Zhang, Yao, Xie, Zhang, et al., 2014). At the same time, the state and type of lake ice and their change to open water system in turn affect the local or regional climate (Brown & Duguay, 2010; Rouse et al., 2005). However, due to the harsh environment and limited accessibility, few meteorological stations exist in the central and western TP where lakes are concentrated; thus, it is difficult to carry out field observations. The unique geographical and climatic conditions of the TP make it a region of high interest for climate research (Kang et al., 2010)."

In addition, possible influence of geographical determined lake locations and physico‐chemical conditions on lake ice phenology are also investigated."

The data were obtained from the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (http://nsidc.org/; version 5 for 2001–2016 and version 6 for 2017) on 8 September 2017. To extract lake ice, pixels covering a lake need to be first distinguished from other types of pixels, such as cloud and land. A threshold of 0.4 for Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI; Hall et al., 2001) is applied to extract the extent of a lake. The cloud removal (gapfilling) process has two steps. The first step is to combine daily Terra and Aqua snow cover products to determine lake cover type. The second step is based on the temporal correlation of cloud cover pixels. First, if a pixel on date t is cloud covered, the pixels on the images of previous and next days will be searched, and if both pixels are covered by water, pixel on date t is determined to be covered by water."

Four MODIS tiles (h24v05, h25v05, h25v06, and h26v05) cover the 58 lakes of this study.

Since 23 July 1972, eight satellites have been launched including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS; ~80 m) and Thematic Mapper (TM; 30 m)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+; 30 m)/Operational Land Imager (OLI; 30 m) with a temporal resolution of 16 days."

                    "Answer": "Integrating MODIS snow cover products with other satellite data, like Landsat, can improve understanding because MODIS provides daily observations and a broad spatial coverage, while Landsat offers higher spatial resolution, complementing each other to fill data gaps and enhance the accuracy of lake ice phenology assessments.",
