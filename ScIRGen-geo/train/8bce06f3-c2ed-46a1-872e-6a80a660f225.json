The glacial lake inventory adopts the Landsat remote sensing data and reflects the status of glacial lakes in the Pakistan region from 2003 to 2004.\n2. In terms of spatial coverage, the glacial lake inventory covers the Swat, Chitral, Gilgit, Hunza, Shigar, Shyok, Upper, Indus, Shingo, Astor and Jhelum river basins in the upper reaches of the Indus River.\n3. The glacial lake inventory data include the glacial lake code, glacial lake type, glacial lake area, distance between the glacier and the glacial lake, glaciers related to the glacial lake, etc.\nFor detailed descriptions of the data, please refer to the data file and report.",
