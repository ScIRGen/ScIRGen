            "description": "This data includes zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, trace geochemistry and Hf isotopic data of the intrusive rocks, as well as major and trace geochemistry and Sr Nd isotopic data of the whole rock. Samples were collected from Xietongmen, Jiacha, xiangbatang, Qulong and other areas in Gangdise belt, southern Tibet. The lithology is dominated by granitic rocks, including granodiorite, granodiorite porphyry, quartz diorite and quartz diorite porphyry. The U-Pb geochronology, trace element geochemistry and Hf isotope data of zircons were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. SR Nd isotopic data of rocks were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Through the data obtained, we can define the geochemical characteristics of regional magmatism age and magma oxygen fugacity, and analyze whether it is conducive to the formation of porphyry deposits.",

                    "Answer": "Incorporating Sr-Nd isotopic data into the analysis of magmatic processes can provide valuable insights into the source composition and magmatic differentiation processes, which are crucial for understanding the potential for porphyry deposit formation. This approach allows for a more comprehensive geochemical characterization, enabling researchers to evaluate the conditions that may lead to ore deposit formation in the region.",

                    "Answer": "Whole-rock major and trace geochemical data are integrated with Sr-Nd isotopic data by using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to analyze the elemental composition, while multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is used for Sr-Nd isotopic analysis. This integration helps define magmatic ages, oxidation states, and source compositions, which are crucial for assessing geological processes and mineral deposit potential.",
