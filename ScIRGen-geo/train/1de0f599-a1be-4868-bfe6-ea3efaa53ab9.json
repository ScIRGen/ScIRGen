            "description": "Soil moisture is one of the core variables in the water cycle. Although its variation is very small, for a precipitation process, soil moisture directly determines the transformation of precipitation into evaporation, runoff and groundwater, which is very important to finely simulate spatial-temporal dynamics of various variables in hydrological process and to accurately estimate water inflow in the upper reaches of Heihe River. This dataset includes soil moisture and temperature data observed by 40 nodes from July 2013 to December 2017. Each node in Babao River Basin has soil moisture observation at depth of 4cm and 20cm; some nodes also include observations at depth of 10 cm. The data observation frequency is 1 hour. The dataset can provide ground -based observations for hydrological simulation, data assimilation and remote sensing verification.",

                "Ecological and hydrological monitoring are essential for understanding basin-scale ecohydrological processes, obtaining baseline data for assessment of impacts and conservation of regional ecosystems, and for the development and validation of ecohydrological models (Brierley et al. 2010). Remote sensing data have advantages in that they facilitate a relatively cheap and rapid means of acquiring up-to-date information over a large geographic area. However, validation studies have shown that these products may be biased (Turneret al. 2006). Traditional fixed-point observation stations such as hydrological and meteorological stations and flux towers yield more accurate observations. However, their high cost, high risk and intensive labour needs limit high-density deployment in a large river basin (Zhanget al.2012). The emergence of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has brought new opportunities for data-intensive observation in ecohydrological research and environmental monitoring (Hart and Martinez2006). For watershed monitoring, an ecohydrological WSN integrates a variety of environmental observations, data processing, wireless communication and energy supply into a sensor node. This forms the WSN with a self-organizing approach, to achieve real-time sensing, monitoring, collecting and processing of information on various hydrological, ecological, and meteorological variables (Zhang et al. 2012). It represents an intensive low-cost observation technique, which enhances basin ecohydrological monitoring capabilities."

                "Since there was no sampling in the study area prior to designing the sampling scheme, remote sensing products and model data were used to provide primary information on the targets such as variograms for LMC. Since the auxiliary maps (Figure 3) show averages for a given time, whereas the three target variables vary in space and time, those maps cannot be used to depict the target variables and were only used to calibrate the UCK model. We assumed that these auxiliary maps could represent the spatial correlation structure and relationships with the covariates. However, two issues need to be addressed, as follows. (a) Scale issue: spatial resolutions of auxiliary maps of LST, precipitation and soil moisture are 1 km; therefore, the maps represent spatial patterns of target variables at 1-km scale. This scale may not be the same as that of spatial patterns characterized by WSN samples on target variables. (b) Uncertainty issue: the data may have uncertainties stemming from remote sensing data and the model. For example, TWI, which was used to represent soil moisture, is affected not only by terrain but also by other factors such as meteorological conditions and land cover. Therefore, TWI will directly affect LMC fitting and sampling optimization results. The trend elimination process and residual error of LMC fitting also introduce uncertainties in the optimization process, which affects the accuracy and reliability of WSN sampling design."

                "The high spatio-temporal resolution of soil moisture distributions plays an important role in ecological and hydrological processes at the basin scale. From the perspective of ecology, soil moisture is related to plant growth and influences the structure, function and diversity of vegetation, especially in arid and semiarid regions. From a hydrologic perspective, soil moisture controls the rainfall-runoff response, particularly when the soil is already saturated. The lack of soil moisture data with high spatio-temporal resolutions is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in such models. Therefore, at the basin scale, high spatio-temporal resolution soil moisture products can be used to understand eco-hydrological processes, calibrate parameters in hydrological models, and improve the prediction ability of hydrological data assimilation systems. However, the soil moisture remote sensing products currently available and operable have resolutions of 25-40 km, which cannot meet the requirements of water cycle research and water resource management at the basin scale. These simulated or assimilated soil moisture products are highly dependent on atmospheric forcing. However, observations of key forcing parameters, such as air temperature, precipitation, wind speed and humidity, are sparse. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately simulate soil moisture dynamics at the basin scale. Thus, the aforementioned methods may not be optimal for providing the spatio-temporal characteristics of soil moisture at the basin scale."

A Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm and MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia are used to estimate daily soil moisture at a resolution of 1 km. The estimation accuracy is evaluated based on automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) and the SMOS soil moisture product. Finally, the mapping results are analyzed to understand the spatio-temporal characteristics of soil moisture."

All the above methods require numerous observation sites to capture the spatial characteristics of soil moisture, and determining the spatial autocorrelation is challenging using only a few observation sites. However, in a basin with complex topography, the WSN distribution would appear sparse, regardless of its spatial coverage and density.

From the perspective of temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from August to October. Based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products."
