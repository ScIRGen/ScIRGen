            "description": "The effective energy and material transfer (EEMT) data set (1980-2018) for 1km on the Zoige Plateau. Effective energy and matter transfer (EEMT) is closely related to the structure and function of the earth's key zones. The unit of effective energy and matter transfer (EEMT) is (Jm-2 s-1or W m-2). The heat energy (EPPT) related to the effective rain energy material transfer, the net primary production energy material transfer (EBIO), and the effective energy and material transfer (EEMT) (which is the sum of both EPPT and EBIO) are used as comprehensive climate indicators, The EEMTMODEL model simulation method is used to evaluate these three indicators, and the Anusplin interpolation software is used to obtain a spatial data set with a resolution of EEMT 1km.",
            "instructions": "File naming: The data is stored in raster format, and the file name is EEMT_XXXX. EEMT stands for effective energy and material transmission; XXXX stands for year, for example, EEMT_2011year represents effective energy and material transmission data in 2011. Data reading method: All files in the data set can be directly opened with ArcGIS. During the reading process, a grid format file will be generated, and the displayed grid file is the graphic representation of the file.",
