            "description": "The stable oxygen isotope ratio (δ 18O) in precipitation is a comprehensive tracer of global atmospheric processes. Since the 1990s, efforts have been made to study the isotopic composition of precipitation at more than 20 stations located on the TP of the Tibetan Plateau, which are located at the air mass intersection between westerlies and monsoons.\nIn this paper, we establish a database of monthly precipitation δ 18O over the Tibetan Plateau and use different models to evaluate the climate control of precipitation δ 18O over TP. The spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation δ 18O and its relationship with temperature and precipitation reveal three different domains, which are respectively related to westerly wind (North TP), Indian monsoon (South TP) and their transition.",

This dataset aims to shed light on the climatic controls of precipitation δ18O across the Tibetan Plateau by examining its relationship with temperature and precipitation. By distinguishing the spatial and temporal patterns of δ18O, the dataset contributes to understanding the interactions between different atmospheric domains, such as the Westerlies in the northern Tibetan Plateau, the Indian Monsoon in the southern Tibetan Plateau, and the transitional zone between them.",
