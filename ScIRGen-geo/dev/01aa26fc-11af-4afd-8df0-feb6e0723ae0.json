            "description": "Under the background of global warming, the cryosphere is one of the most sensitive spheres to climate change. The cryosphere is the world's largest reservoir of freshwater resources. The change of the cryosphere has an important impact on the energy exchange, water resources, ecology and disaster process of the earth atmosphere system. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the response of cryosphere change to climate change. Using satellite remote sensing data, reanalysis data, and observation data, the cryosphere elements were integrated to build a global scale cryosphere range and phenology dataset for 1979-2016. The results can be used to further study the response mechanism of the cryosphere to climate change, as well as to provide basic support for the research of ecosystems, carbon cycle, etc.",

Furthermore, the near-surface atmosphere in high-latitude and high-altitude regions has warmed faster than elsewhere. Observational records of ocean heat content show accelerated warming as well. The global temperature rise has resulted in a worldwide cryospheric reduction as evidenced by, for example, a strong increase in ice loss, pervasive ice sheet mass loss, large decreases in sea ice cover and thickness, and terrestrial snow cover extent decreases. The cryosphere plays a major role in earth's climate system. Most cryospheric assessments focus on one or more of its components and their response to climate change."

Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the cryosphere as a whole, and provide a way to quantitatively estimate its overall changes."

                "To combine the three major cryospheric components into one global cryospheric extent data set, we grid all products into one uniform 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation at the daily time scale. For the ground surface freeze/thaw status, the twice daily (AM and PM) values were averaged into daily resolution, and also interpolated to the 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation. For snow cover, ERA-Interim snow depths are used to identify snow cover based on daily snow depths greater than 1 cm. The snow cover extent data set also again includes ice sheets, that is, Greenland and Antarctica. Sea ice extent is available at the daily time scale, except for the time period from November 1, 1978 to August 19, 1987 when data were only available every other day. For this period, we interpolated the sea ice extent into daily resolution. Finally, we combined all three data sets into one, where each grid cell was classified as cryosphere if it contains at least one of the frozen surface types: frozen ground (including ice sheets), snow cover, or sea ice cover. If a grid cell contains one or more cryospheric variables, it is defined as one single cell occupied by cryosphere. Based on this classification, we produced the daily cryospheric extent data set. To assess the long-term spatiotemporal variability of the cryosphere, we calculate both the area extent and the percent cover. For area extent, we calculated the daily areas for the NH, SH, and the whole globe. We also create monthly and annual area extents to quantify changes in cryospheric area extent based on the daily area extent datasets in each year. All area extent calculations are based on equal area projections. The percent cover is calculated as the ratio of days that each grid contains cryospheric cover during the defined time scale, for example, per month, or per year. To characterize the timing and duration of cryospheric cover, we identify the first date (FD), last date (LD), duration (DR), and number of days (ND) of cryospheric cover. We investigate anomalies of monthly and annual variables with respect to the 1981–2000 long-term average. Trends are calculated using linear regression of the anomalies. Statistical significance of trends was established using two-tailed t-tests at the 95% confidence level. Time series are smoothed using wavelet analysis. The uncertainty of the trends is also determined using the 95% confidence level. The daily cryospheric extent is verified using the GSOD product. To verify our reconstructed daily cryosphere extent data set, 14,310 stations were used for validation. The observed daily cryospheric status at each station is determined based on the above method using observed daily minimum air temperature and snow depth. Next, the reconstructed daily cryospheric extent value at each station location is extracted. The observed (GSOD) cryospheric status is then used to verify our reconstructed daily cryospheric extent."

                "Data sets used in this study include sea ice, snow cover, and near-surface frozen soils. Area extent of both the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets is included in either snow cover or near-surface frozen soil products. We essentially synthesize three major data products: near-surface frozen soil data, snow cover extent data, and sea ice area extent. To analyze the cryospheric extent's relationship with climate change, air temperature data are used. We also use in-situ station observations to validate our global cryospheric area extent. Sea ice is a major cryospheric component for the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. Here, we use the daily sea ice extent data set for 1978–2016 with 25 × 25 km spatial resolution from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). For global snow cover extent, we use snow depth from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) for 1979 to 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. Daily ground surface freeze/thaw status data span from 1979 to 2016 and are available at 25 × 25 km resolution from NSIDC. Global monthly average air temperature data were obtained beginning in 1979 from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit time series version 4.04. Station data are used in this study to verify our daily cryospheric extent data set. The global summary of the day (GSOD) product is produced by the National Centers for Environmental Information with inputs from integrated surface data. The GSOD data set is made up of more than 28,000 stations from 1929 to the present, and includes minimum, maximum, and mean air temperature, snow depth, air pressure, dewpoint temperature, wind speed, and precipitation variables."

The first day of cryospheric cover was delayed by 3.6 days at a rate of 0.95 days/decade, and the last day advanced by 5.7 days, at a rate of 1.5 days/decade. The duration and number of cryospheric cover days decreased by 8.7 days and 7.6 days over the study period, respectively. These variations of global cryospheric extent are correlated with rising air temperatures."

                    "Answer": "To integrate these data sources into a comprehensive cryospheric dataset, the process involves synthesizing sea ice, snow cover, and frozen ground extents into one global cryospheric extent data set. This is achieved by gridding all products into a uniform 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation at the daily time scale. For the ground surface freeze/thaw status, twice daily (AM and PM) values are averaged into daily resolution, while snow cover and sea ice extents are adjusted to daily scales as well.",

Daily areas for the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and the whole globe are computed, with monthly and annual area extents derived to quantify changes. The percent cover is determined as the ratio of days each grid contains cryospheric cover during a defined time scale, such as per month or year. Anomalies of monthly and annual variables are investigated with respect to the 1981–2000 long-term average, and trends are calculated using linear regression of the anomalies.",

For example, the daily cryospheric status at each station is determined using observed daily minimum air temperature and snow depth. This observed status is then compared with the reconstructed daily cryospheric extent value at each station location. For verification, the GSOD product, with inputs from over 28,000 stations, is used to ensure the accuracy of the cryospheric extent data set.",

Products are gridded into a uniform 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation at the daily time scale. Snow cover is identified using ERA-Interim snow depths, and sea ice extent data is interpolated to daily resolution. The unified data set is created by classifying each grid cell as part of the cryosphere if it contains any frozen surface types.",
