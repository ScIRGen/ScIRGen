It may also involve the collection of core samples from Quaternary and bedrock layers, installation of filter pipes at the bottom of wells, and well flushing. The profile provides comprehensive details about the geological and hydrological characteristics encountered during drilling.",

The process includes drafting a drilling report, creating a location map, and generating borehole profiles. Core samples from the Quaternary and bedrock layers are collected, and filter pipes are installed at the bottom of the wells followed by well flushing. The total planned drilling depth is 240 meters, with each borehole averaging 60 meters deep, and the actual depth is controlled by the depth of the bedrock exposure.",
