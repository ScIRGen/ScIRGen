Generation of digital terrain model (DTM) in forested area is very important for estimation of canopy height and fractional cover describing vegetation cover density which serves as an important parameter for biosphere modeling. In forested area, DTM can be generated from ground points of lidar data and fractional cover can be derived from vegetation points of lidar data. Separation of ground points and above-ground points is a significant work for retrieval of forest structure information during the processing of LIDAR data. In previous studies, different algorithms had been developed for generation of DTM from airborne laser scanning data."

In this tested area, a total number of 1546 field measurement ground points were measured with a total station TOPCON GTS-602 and TOPCON GTS-7002 for validation of DTM and the mean error value is −18.5 cm and the RMSE (root mean square error) is ±20.9 cm. A data trap sizes of 4 m in diameter from airborne laser scanner data was selected to compute vegetation fraction cover. Validation of fractional vegetation cover was carried out using 15 hemispherical photographs, which are georeferenced to centimeter accuracy by differential GPS. The gap fraction was computed over a range of zenith angles 10° using the gap light analyzer (GLA) from each hemispherical photograph."
