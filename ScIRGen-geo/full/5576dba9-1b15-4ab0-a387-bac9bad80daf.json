            "description": "Supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science (XDA19070100). Tao Che, the director of this program, who comes from Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing of Gansu Province, Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, CAS. They used machine learning methods combined with multi-source gridded snow depth product data to derive a long-time series over the Northern Hemisphere.\nFirstly, the applicability of artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) method in snow depth fusion are compared. It is found that random forest method shows strong advantages in snow depth data fusion. Secondly, using the random forest method, combined with remote sensing snow depth products such as AMSR-E, AMSR-2, NHSD and GlobSnow and reanalysis data such as ERA-Interim and MERRA-2. These gridded snow depth products and environmental factor variables are used as the input independent variables of the model. In situ observations of China Meteorological Station (945), Russia Meteorological Station (620), Russian snow survey data (514), and global historical meteorological network (41261) are used as reference truth to train and verify the model. The daily gridded snow depth dataset of the snow hydrological year from 1980 to 2019 (September 1 of the previous year to May 31 of the current year) is prepared on the cloud platform provided by the CASEarth. Since the passive microwave brightness temperature data from 1980 to 1987 is the data of every other day, there will be a small number of missing trips in the data during this period. Using the ESM-SnowMIP and independent ground observation data for verification, the quality of the fusion data set has been improved. According to the comparison between the ground observation data and the snow depth products before fusion, the determination coefficient (R2) of the fusion data is increased from 0.23 (GlobSnow snow depth product) to 0.81, and the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are also reduced to 7.7 cm and 2.7 cm.",
            "instructions": "The daily snow depth data is a matrix with 1440 columns and 360 rows, and the spatial resolution of the data is 0.25 °, NoData_Value is represented by - 9999. The snow depth datasets are stored according to the natural year folder by folder, the folder of each year contains the daily fused gridded snow depth dataset of that year. The data format of fused snow depth dataset is stored in GeoTiff format, the unit of snow depth data is centimeter, and the projection is WGS84. Among these years, the daily fused snow depth dataset from September 1, 1980 to December 31 of that year were contained in folder of 1980, and the folder of 2019 contains the daily fused snow depth dataset from 1 January 1, 2019 to May 31 of that year. Except for these two years, al folders contain the fused snow depth dataset from January 1 to May 31 and September 1 to December 31. Because of the quality of the original gridded snow depth datasets, daily snow depth datasets from June 1 to August 31 were not considered in our study. The file name is \"ML_NHSD_YYYY-MM-DD.tif\", where ML stands for machine learning, NHSD stands for Northern Hemisphere Snow Depth, YYYY stands for the natural years from 1980 to 2019, MM stands for January to December (except June to August), and DD stands for the date. The file can be viewed with software such as ArcMAP or QGIS and processed accordingly. \nThe original gridded snow depth datasets of NHSD and GlobSnow were produced with the passive microwave brightness temperature from SMMR sensor in 1980 to 1987. The SMMR dataset was the other day dataset and with large missing bands. Snow depth dataset of NHSD and GlobSnow were also inevitably have a large number of missing data, and the fused snow depth dataset have a similar situation. The fused snow depth is as complete as possible for the land area of the Northern Hemisphere, there are minor missing data on some days, and the coastal areas such as Greenland and Iceland are not within the scope of the study.",

                "Seasonal snow is a fundamental component of the global energy and water cycles (Barnett et al., 2005; Bormann et al., 2018). Snowpack is highly vulnerable to climate change, but although snow extent is monitored routinely, the fundamental properties of snow depth is measured remarkably poorly (Pritchard., 2021). The IPCC Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) highlighted key strengths and weaknesses in our understanding of the cryosphere and mass and spatial-temporal variability trends in snow depth over the Northern Hemisphere during the 20th century that have still not been accurately assessed (IPCC, 2019). In contrast to snow cover, reliable quantitative knowledge on snow depth and its trend is lacking (Bormann et al., 2018; Pulliainen et al., 2020). Snow depth is more challenging to monitor than snow cover extent at both global (Zhu et al., 2021) and regional scales because of limited surface observations along with inadequate measurements and methods for retrieval from space (Bormann et al., 2018). Hence, confidence in snow depth trends is much lower than that of snow cover extent. Currently, snow depth data can be obtained from manual observations, passive microwave brightness temperature, synthetic aperture radars (Lievens et al., 2019), and reanalysis datasets. In situ observations consist of meteorological station data, snow survey data and automatic snow depth observation equipment set up in the field. These datasets, while accurate, are based on single-point observation. Snow surveys are time-consuming and laborious. Some automatic measurement networks provide snow depth information, but are mostly located in nearly flat terrains and seldom cover the highest elevations (Dozier et al., 2016). Snow depth data retrieved based on passive microwave brightness can reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of large areas. Hereafter, these datasets are referred to as remote sensing snow depth products. At present, frequently used remote sensing snow depth products are from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2), which succeeded AMSR-E, a long time series of the Northern Hemisphere snow depth (NHSD) and the Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow). The accuracy of AMSR-E and AMSR-2 is higher in North America than in Eurasia (Xiao et al., 2020). The accuracy of the NHSD snow depth product is high in China but low in Europe, America and Canada, where snow tends to be deep (Hu et al., 2021). GlobSnow incorporated some ground observations and has been recognized as the most accurate remote sensing."

The original spatial resolution of the MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset was 0.5° × 0.625°, which was subsequently resampled to 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution by nearest interpolation. This ensured that the original gridded snow depth products used in this study had the same spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and daily temporal resolution from 1980 to 2019. In this study, the time series of these in situ observations were obtained from 1980 to 2019."

The fused snow depth had a decreasing trend based on the spatiotemporal analysis and Mann-Kendall trend test method. This fused snow depth product provides the basis for understanding the temporal and spatial characteristics of snow cover and their relation to climate change, hydrological and water cycle, water resource management, ecological environment and snow disaster and hazard prevention."
