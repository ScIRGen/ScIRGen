            "description": "The dataset of available soil water content in the middle and lower Heihe River Basin at the north of Qilian Mountains (2001-2015) is stimulated by the Hydrological-Ecological Integrated watershed Flow Model (HEIFLOW). HEIFLOW is a three-dimensional distributed eco-hydrological coupling model, integrating the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the Modular Groundwater Flow Model (MODFLOW) and several ecological modules, which can completely describe the hydrological cycle and vegetation ecological process of the basin. For the modeling details of generating this data, please refer to Han et al. (2021), and for the technical details of HEIFLOW  model, please refer to Han et al. (2021), Tian et al. (2018), and sun et al. (2018)",
