      "description": "River lake ice phenology is sensitive to climate change and is an important indicator of climate change. 308 excel file names correspond to Lake numbers. Each excel file contains six columns, including daily ice coverage information of corresponding lakes from July 2002 to June 2018. The attributes of each column are: date, lake water coverage, lake water ice coverage, cloud coverage, lake water coverage and lake ice coverage after cloud treatment. Generally, the ice cover area ratio of 0.1 and 0.9 is used as the basis to distinguish the lake ice phenology. The excel file contained in the data set can further obtain four lake ice phenological parameters: Fus, fue, bus, bue, and 92 lakes. Two parameters, Fus and bue, can be obtained.",

        "Known as the \"Roof of the World,\" the Tibetan Plateau has an average elevation of more than 2,000 m and an abundance of lakes. Lake ice is an indicator of changes in lake environments; moreover, it is also one of the key Environmental Climate Variables (ECVs) in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). However, the existing in situ lake ice observation data for the Tibetan Plateau is severely limited due to the remoteness, harsh eco-environmental conditions, and thin atmosphere in this region. At present, many researchers have studied the lake ice phenology based on remote sensing data and released four data sets, but the dataset derived primarily from coarse resolution passive microwave observations is not effective for monitoring the numerous small lakes in the Tibetan Plateau."

        "Therefore, a comprehensive lake ice monitoring dataset is urgently needed to compensate for this observation shortage. The dataset presented herein was prepared using the MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) with a spatial resolution of 500 m as input for the NDSI snow cover algorithm SNOWMAP in order to detect the lake ice coverage under daily clear sky conditions. This method was used to calculate and classify the daily lake ice characteristics for the maximum number of lakes within the Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2018."

The dataset derived primarily from coarse resolution passive microwave observations is not effective for monitoring the numerous small lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. The SNOWMAP algorithm tends to incorrectly identify lake ice pixels under clear sky conditions, which indicates that an updated algorithm for the snow/ice recognition is needed."

      "methods": [
        "The MODIS data pre-processing was carried out at the UTM/WGS84 system with steps of image splicing, projection, transformation, and image cropping. The NDSI snow cover algorithm SNOWMAP was used to estimate the daily lake ice on/off at a single pixel under clear sky, and then a series of further processes was conducted under cloudy conditions based on spatial and temporal continuity of lake surface conditions. Based on the complementary morning and afternoon satellite observations, daily lake ice/water data under cloud cover conditions was synthesized based on the following three rules. The cloud-covered pixels were re-identified using spatial adjacent relationships and its spatial continuity based on their proximity. Aiming to obtain the inventory of lake ice/water change characteristics for every single lake, a further time series filter was conducted for each lake with ice, water, and cloud."

As a result, the lake ice extent data with partial cloud cover were obtained for 5,834 days, and lake ice, water and cloud coverage for each single lake, which was defined as the ratio of extent of lake ice and lake area, were obtained accordingly. Of total 2612 examined lakes in Tibetan Plateau, the 5834 days’ time series of cloud free time series of lake ice coverage for 625 lakes with areas larger than 3 km2 were effectively recorded."
