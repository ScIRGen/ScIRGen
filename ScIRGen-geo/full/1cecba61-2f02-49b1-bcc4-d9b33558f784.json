                    "Question": "What are the specific procedures involved in using GPS radiosonde systems for collecting atmospheric observation data, and how can this method be optimized to improve data accuracy and coverage in hydrological experiments?",
                    "Answer": "The use of GPS radiosonde systems, such as those from Vaisala Inc., involves deploying instruments that measure temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew point temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, meridional and zonal wind speeds, wind speed, and wind direction at a sampling frequency of every 2 seconds. These systems are typically released at times corresponding to satellite or aircraft overpasses to ensure synchronization. The optimization can involve selecting strategic release times and locations to maximize spatial coverage and aligning with specific meteorological events or conditions being studied. During the Heihe experiments, radiosonde systems were released at various locations in both upstream and midstream areas on specified dates, ensuring comprehensive coverage of different geographic and climatic conditions.",
