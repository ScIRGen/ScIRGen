            "description": "Daily precipitation data was reconstructed for streamflow simulation in the entire UB by combining orographic and linear correction approaches based on 262 gauge observations. The reconstructed precipitation is used to drive the VIC hydrological model linked with a temperature-index model (VIC-Glacier) , and is inversely evaluated by comparing with observed discharge, glacier area changes, and MODIS-based snow cover faction (SCF) data in the upper Brahmaputra Basin.",

This method utilized existing monthly precipitation data from 262 rain gauges collected from 2014 to 2016. The approach combined elevation terrain and linear corrections to adjust precipitation data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (GLDAS), enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.",

                    "Answer": "The recalibration of precipitation data using elevation and linear corrections was necessary to enhance the accuracy of the data derived from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (GLDAS). This was particularly important due to the complex topography of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin, which affects precipitation distribution. By integrating data from 262 existing rain gauges and employing these corrections, researchers aimed to reconstruct daily precipitation data with a 10km resolution from 1961 to 2016, ensuring it accurately reflects the unique climatic and geographic conditions of the basin and its sub-basins.",

                    "Answer": "The goal is to create a high-resolution and accurate dataset of daily precipitation for the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin by correcting existing data from the China Meteorological Administration and Global Land Data Assimilation Systems using elevation and linear correction methods. This reconstructed dataset is intended to drive the VIC hydrological model for simulating runoff and ice-snow areas across the basin and its sub-basins, facilitating validation with observed runoff, MODIS data, and glacier inventory data.",
