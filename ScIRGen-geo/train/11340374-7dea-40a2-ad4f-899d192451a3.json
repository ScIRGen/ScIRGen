                    "Answer": "In the Heihe River Basin, data collection using a portable field spectrometer involves direct, in-situ measurements of reflectance from various ground surfaces, such as vegetation and soil types. This approach provides high-resolution spectral data specific to the area and time, with measurements taken vertically on reference boards and the ground surface. In contrast, other remote sensing techniques might rely on satellite or aerial imagery, which can cover larger areas but may not offer the same level of spectral detail or the ability to measure reflectance under specific conditions. Additionally, portable spectrometers allow for the collection of data under controlled conditions, whereas remote sensing data may be influenced by atmospheric conditions, sensor limitations, and temporal differences.",

This method helps in calibrating the spectral data by accounting for atmospheric and equipment-related variations, ensuring accurate reflectance measurements of the surface features observed during the remote sensing experiments.",
