            "description": "This data is the drilling sample of the copper molybdenum deposit in the south of Hucun. The testing includes the whole rock principal and trace analysis of granodiorite, electron microprobe analysis of biotite, pyrite and garnet, S-Pb isotopic analysis of skarn, and Re Os isotopic dating of molybdenite. The major data were obtained by XRF, the trace elements were analyzed by ICP-MS, the major elements of biotite were analyzed by EPMA, and the S-Pb and Re Os isotopes were measured by the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The above data have been published in international journals, the data is really reliable. Based on the data obtained, the metallogenic age, petrogenesis, magma source, composition and evolution of the south area of Hucun are determined, and new evidence is provided for the evolution history of the hydrothermal metallogenic system, which is of great significance for understanding the metallogenic process.",
