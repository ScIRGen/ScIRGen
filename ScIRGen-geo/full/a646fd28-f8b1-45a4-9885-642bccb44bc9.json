                "The China–Russia crude oil pipeline (CRCOP) begins in Skovorodino, Russia, enters China in Xing’an, Mohe County, and terminates in Daqing, Heilongjiang Province. The pipeline traverses a total of 441 km over permafrost regions. Along the pipeline, due to the complex topography, high forest coverage, and dense vegetation, stream flows have developed owing to the large amounts of precipitation and fertile soil in these regions. Due to interactions between the pipeline and the underlying permafrost, the thermal condition of the foundation soil varies markedly in different terrains. Freeze–thaw processes increase the maximum thawing depth under the pipe, which results in significant settlement. The permafrost in eastern China is known as Xing’an-Baikal permafrost. At altitudes lower than 800 m along the pipeline, the permafrost is thermally unstable and ecologically sensitive to climate change. With the development of global warming and anthropogenic activities, permafrost in eastern China has been degraded 50–150 km northward of the Xing’anling Mountains over the past 50 years. Previous literature regarding buried pipes in permafrost regions mainly focused on the thermal effects, calculations, and forecasts of freeze–thaw processes in the context of oil transportation at above-freezing temperatures. In addition to theoretical analyses and calculations, field monitoring is a necessary method to reveal the mechanisms of pipe deformation and interactions between pipes and permafrost. Frost heave and thaw settlement in permafrost regions along a pipeline are related to the ice content, the amount of moisture in the active layer, and the quantity of ground surface water. Apart from frost heave and thaw settlement, water erosion from surface flow is the main cause of damage to pipe embankments, which can aggravate pipe settlement."

In this paper, ponds and erosive damage sites along the CRCOP were found. The distribution of water bodies was extracted by the normalized difference water index (NDWI) from Landsat 8 images. The main influential factors were selected, and their attributes were considered in a logistic regression model that was used to regress the weight of each factor and calculate the probability of freeze–thaw hazards and erosive damage to the CRCOP. The results of this study may provide a scientific basis and reference for the hazard treatment and operation management of pipes in permafrost regions."

The buried depths of the pipe, landform types, vegetation types, soil types, and ice content were collected from a 400 km length along the pipeline before the pipe was encased in pavement. The data were collected every 2 km during the survey; this spacing was determined by considering the feasibility and cost of designing and constructing the pipeline. Ponds on both sides of the pipeline in the range of 300 m were identified and extracted from the NDWI. After the regression, the weight of each influential factor was obtained from the coefficient of the independent variable(s). The probabilities of freeze–thaw hazards and water erosion were then calculated with the derived logistic regression model."

                    "Answer": "Identifying water erosion sites often involves field surveys that measure erosive damage near the pipeline, focusing on physical signs of erosion. Locating ponds, however, combines field surveys with remote sensing techniques like NDWI to detect water bodies.
