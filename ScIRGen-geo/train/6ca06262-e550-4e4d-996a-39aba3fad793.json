            "description": "Loess in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) preserves abundant information about the dust cycle over Asia. \nHowever, the variations of loess source and composition over time remain controversial. Soluble salt is an important dust component and is linked to the landforms and environments associated with dust mobilization, \ntransport and deposition. Based on an investigation of the soluble salts of two loess sequences from the central and western CLP, we show that the soluble salts of Chinese loess mainly stepwise increased at ~1 and ~ 0.5 Ma. Several lines of evidence indicated that the increased supply of soluble salts mainly originated from dust input, suggesting the enhanced salinity of Asian dust. The enhanced soluble-salt-bearing dust was driven by lakebed evolution in the potential source areas, as confirmed by abundant geomorphological and sedimentological evidence. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition (associated with Tibetan Plateau uplift) induced aridity of the potential source areas (PSA) and Mid-Brunhes Transition triggered intensifying East Asian summer monsoon are responsible for the stepwise lakebed evolution in the PSA at ~1 and ~ 0.5 Ma, respectively, which in turn acted as an important soluble-salt-bearing dust reservoir. These findings provide new evidence for understanding the evolution of regional dust emissions and their possible environmental effects in the past and future. \n\nData source: The samples were collected from the Lingtai section in the central part of the Loess Plateau and the Jiuzhoutai section in the western part. A total of 133 samples were collected from the Lingtai section, and 90 samples were collected from the Jiuzhoutai section for soluble salt determination. Select 3-5 representative samples from each loess and paleosol layer in the Lingtai and Jiuzhoutai sections.\n\nProcessing method: Before determining soluble salts, all samples are dried and ground in agate mortar, and passed through 100% μ M's sieve. Weigh 10g of the sample, mix it with distilled water (1:5), mix thoroughly, centrifuge, and extract the supernatant to determine the soluble salt content. The supernatant was measured using DIONEX's ICS-2500 ion chromatograph, which can measure seven major ions in the solution, including anions Cl-, NO3-, So42-, and cations Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, with a measurement accuracy of 0.1% to 0.3%. All experiments were conducted at the Western Environmental Key Laboratory of Lanzhou University.",

                    "Answer": "The observed increases in soluble salt content at ~1 Ma and ~0.5 Ma suggest a stepwise evolution of lake beds in the potential source area, driven by regional aridification and intensified East Asian summer monsoon. This evolution likely enhanced the supply of salt-rich dust, indicating a change in dust mobilization and environmental conditions, possibly linked to tectonic uplift and climatic shifts such as the mid-Pleistocene transition.",

                    "Answer": "The variability in soluble salt content in loess deposits over the past 2.5 million years is attributed to multiple factors, including the input of dust, which increased the salinity of Asian dust, and the evolution of lake beds in potential source areas. This evolution was driven by increased aridification due to the mid-Pleistocene transition associated with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the intensification of the East Asian summer monsoon during the mid-Brunhes transition. These processes led to the stepwise development of saline dust reservoirs in potential source regions.",

This method allows for the identification of major ions present in the samples, which can be linked to environmental conditions and dust source changes over time. The results suggest that increases in soluble salt content, particularly around ~1 Ma and ~0.5 Ma, are primarily due to increased dust input, reflecting changes in the Asian dust cycle and potentially providing evidence of environmental shifts such as aridification of source regions and enhanced monsoon activity.",

The study aims to reveal how soluble salt content has increased in stages around 1 Ma and 0.5 Ma, likely due to inputs from dust, indicating a rise in dust salinity in Asia.
