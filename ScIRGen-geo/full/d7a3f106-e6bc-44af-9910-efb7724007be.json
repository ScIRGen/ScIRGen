            "description": "The data set includes major and trace elements, major mineral elements, whole rock SR – Nd isotope, zircon u – Pb age and Hf isotope data of diorite. Samples were collected from diorite in Wudaoliang area of Hoh Xil block, northern Tibet. Zircon U-Pb dating data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Hf isotopic data of zircons were obtained by laser ablation multiple acceptor inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major and trace geochemical data of the whole rock are obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data of major elements in minerals are obtained by electron microprobe analysis. The whole rock SR – Nd isotopes were obtained by sample separation and purification multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Through the data obtained, we can define the age, origin and deep dynamic mechanism of magmatism in the region, and provide knowledge on the origin of high magnesian characteristics of continental crust.",

By examining zircon U–Pb ages and Hf isotopes, along with whole-rock Sr–Nd isotopes and major-trace geochemistry, researchers can constrain the age, genesis, and tectonic processes underlying the magmatic activities. This helps in understanding the characteristics and origin of high-magnesium andesitic features in the continental crust.",

It also enhances insights into the origin of high-magnesium andesite characteristics in continental crust.",

Zircon Hf isotopic data are acquired through laser ablation-multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). Whole-rock major and trace geochemical data are obtained using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), while mineral major element data are analyzed using electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). Whole-rock Sr–Nd isotopic compositions are determined through sample separation and purification followed by analysis with multi-receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). These methods allow researchers to define the timing, origin, and deep dynamic mechanisms of magmatic processes in the region and provide insights into the origin of high-magnesium andesite characteristics in continental crust.",
