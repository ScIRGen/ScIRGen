            "description": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable for high temperature and drought monitoring and\nclimate and ecological environment research. Due to the sparse distribution of ground observation stations, thermal infrared remote sensing technology has become an important means of quickly obtaining ground temperature over large areas. However, there are many missing and low-quality values in satellite-based LST data because clouds cover more than 60% of the global surface every day. This article presents a unique LST dataset with a monthly temporal resolution for China from 2003 to 2017 that makes full use of the advantages of MODIS data and meteorological station data to overcome the defects of cloud influence via a reconstruction model. We specifically describe the reconstruction model, which uses a combination of MODIS daily data, monthly data and meteorological station data to reconstruct the LST in areas with cloud coverage and for grid cells with elevated LST error, and the data performance is then further improved by establishing a regression analysis model. The validation indicates that the new LST dataset is highly consistent with in situ observations. For the six natural subregions with different climatic conditions in China, verification using ground observation data shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 1.24 to 1.58 K, the mean absolute error (MAE) varies from 1.23 to 1.37 K and the Pearson coefficient (R2) ranges from 0.93 to 0.99. The new dataset adequately captures the spatiotemporal variations in LST at annual, seasonal and monthly scales. From 2003 to 2017, the overall annual mean LST in China showed a weak increase. Moreover, the positive trend was remarkably unevenly distributed across China. The most significant warming occurred in the central and western areas of the Inner Mongolia Plateau in the Northwest Region, and the average annual temperature change is greater than 0.1K (R>0:71, P<0:05), and a strong negative trend was observed in some parts of the Northeast Region and South China Region. Seasonally, there was significant warming in western China in winter, which was most pronounced in December. The reconstructed dataset exhibits significant improvements and can be used for the spatiotemporal evaluation of LST in high-temperature and drought-monitoring studies.\nMore detail please refer to Zhao et al (2020). doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3528024",

                "Land surface temperature (LST), which is controlled by land–atmosphere interactions and energy fluxes, is an essential parameter for the physical processes of the surface energy balance and water cycle at regional and global scales. LST datasets not only are required for high-temperature and drought research over various spatial scales but also are important elements for improving global hydrological and climate prediction models. LST is measured by meteorological stations which have the advantages of high reliability and long time series. However, the meteorological station data collected as point data with very limited spatial coverage are often sparsely and/or irregularly distributed, especially in remote and rugged areas. In contrast to ground-based observations with their limited availability and discrete spatial information, images captured by satellite thermal infrared instruments have become reliable alternative data sources with the advantages of detailed spatialized surfaces and near-real-time data access. However, satellite-derived LST data are frequently and strongly affected by data gaps and cloud cover, which affect the quality of the LST product. Cloud cover is frequent, and the locations of cloud cover are often uncertain. On average, at any one time, approximately 65 % of the global surface is obscured by clouds, leading directly to missing values over large, unevenly distributed areas in an image."
