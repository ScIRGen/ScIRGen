            "description": "Three Muscovite were collected from 509 Banxi lithium beryllium rare metal mine, The 40Ar/39Ar dating data of Muscovite in spodumene-bearing pegmatite veins show that the crystallization age of the minerals is 188Ma, indicates that regional temperature for this area kept as 350℃ for 30Myr, and this thermal environment is conducive to the evolution and crystallization of granite-pegmatite system.. In combination of the regional orogeny (ca. 210~200Ma) of the Paleo-Tethys, the geological features as well as the ore-forming ages demonstrate that the tectonic environment of West Kunlun and Karakunlun was post collision extension during 188Ma, which is a favorable condition for the element enrichment and mineralization in Dahongliutan rare metal ore field. This understanding has practical significance for regional metallogenic potential evaluation and prospecting.",

This method is particularly suited for analyzing the thermal history and tectonic environments, such as the post-collision extension phase observed in the context of the Western Kunlun-Karakoram region. In comparison, other radiometric techniques might vary in their precision, sample applicability, and the type of geological history they can reveal.",

This prolonged thermal environment was conducive to the evolution and crystallization of the granite-pegmatite system. Additionally, the combination of this data with the historical evolution of the Paleo-Tethys orogeny (210-200 million years ago) suggests that the 西昆仑-喀喇昆仑 region was in a post-collisional extensional tectonic environment at 188 million years, which created favorable conditions for the enrichment and mineralization of rare metal deposits in the 大红柳滩 area.",

                    "Answer": "The determination of the 188Ma mineral crystallization age using the 40Ar/39Ar dating method for white mica was influenced by the cooling of the regional environment to 350℃ over a period of 30 million years. This prolonged thermal environment was conducive to the evolution and crystallization of the granite-pegmatite system, in the context of the post-collision extensional tectonic environment during the evolutionary history of the regional Paleo-Tethys orogeny.",

                    "Answer": "The use of Ar-Ar dating data on white mica can reveal the mineral crystallization age, showing how long the regional environment remained at certain temperatures, such as 350℃. This understanding can indicate the duration of favorable conditions for the evolution and crystallization of granite-pegmatite systems, which in turn can help assess the mineralization potential and guide exploration efforts in rare metal mineralization fields.",

This thermal condition is conducive to the evolution and crystallization of the granite-pegmatite system. By correlating with the history of the regional Paleo-Tethys orogeny (210~200Ma), it is concluded that the area was in a post-collision extensional tectonic environment during 188Ma, creating favorable conditions for element enrichment and mineralization in the Dahongliutan rare metal ore field, thus supporting mineral potential evaluation and exploration.",
