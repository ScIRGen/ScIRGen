            "description": "The Qingmuguan watershed, located at the junction of Beibei, Shapingba and Bishan districts in Chongqing, is an observation watershed of the National Field Scientific Observatory of Karst Ecosystem in Jinfoshan, Chongqing. The soil temperature and humidity data set of Qingmuguan watershed integrates multilayer soil temperature and humidity time series from 12 stations in the watershed. The observation stations use the ECH2O observation system developed by Meter, Inc. with Em50 data collector and 5TM soil temperature and moisture sensors to realize automatic monitoring. The observation network was completed in December 2019 with a sampling interval of 15 min. soil temperature and moisture were monitored at soil depths of 0-5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm in that order. data were stored in Excel format.",
            "instructions": "Data files are named as \"QMG_smst_Sxx. xlsx\", in which “vv” denotes varlables (\"sm\" for soil moisture, and \"st\" for soil temperature), and \"xx\" denotes the station ID (01-12). Within each file, the sampling time (UTC+8) and soil moisture and soil temperature at different depths are column-wisely stored, and missing values are filled with -99. The spreadsheet \"QMG_smst_station_info.xlsx\" contains latitude and longitude information for all stations. Microsoft Office Excel can be used to retrieve the data.",
