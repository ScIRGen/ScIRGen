            "description": "The reflectivity Z of the ground-based Ka/Ku (35.5/13.6 GHz) band weather radar at Dari from 1 August to 30 September, 2019 were provided. The radar is the vehicle mounted radar system maintained by Qinghai University. The radar is only operational at daytime (8:00~20:00) during the observation period, mainly scanning in PPI mode at the elevation angle 50° to avoid the terrain occlusion. The radial range gate resolution and beamwidth are 75 m and 1°, respectively. The time resolution for one scan is 1 min. Considering the elevation angle (50°) and the gate resolution (75m), the Z from 2-15 gate at 0-360° were averaged as the 1-min radar measurements Zh (Ka) and Zh (Ku).  The data can provide important information for radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) over the TP.",

                    "Answer": "The radar reflectivity factors from the Ka/Ku band weather radar provide insights into precipitation characteristics and patterns over the region. By analyzing temporal and spatial variations in the reflectivity factors during the observation period, researchers can infer the occurrence and intensity of precipitation events. The methodology involves using the PPI mode with a 50° elevation angle to minimize terrain interference, allowing for consistent data collection during daylight hours. The averaging of reflectivity factors from 2-15 range gates within a 0-360° scan angle further aids in obtaining reliable data for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). Such patterns may help in understanding localized weather phenomena or broader climate dynamics affecting the region.",

The radar performs a 360° scan at a resolution of 1 minute, with a range bin length of 75 meters and a beam width of 1°. During data collection, the reflectivity factors Zh (Ka) and Zh (Ku) are averaged over 2-15 range bins for better accuracy.
