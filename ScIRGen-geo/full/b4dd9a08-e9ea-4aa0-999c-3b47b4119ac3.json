            "description": "Surface albedo is a critical parameter in land surface energy balance. This dataset provides the monthly land surface albedo of UAV remote sensing for typical ground stations in the middle reaches of Heihe river basin during the vegetation growth stage (June to October) in 2020 (The data of Huazhaizi station in August is not available because of technical problem). The algorithm for calculating albedo is an empirical method, which was developed based on a comprehensive forward simulation dataset based on 6S model and typical spectrums. This method can effectively transform the surface reflectance to the broadband surface albedo. The method was then applied to the surface reflectance acquired by UAV multi-spectral sensor and the broadband surface albedo with a 0.2-m spatial resolution was eventually obtained.",

The regression model is then applied to the surface reflectance obtained by UAV multispectral remote sensing sensors to derive surface albedo data with a 0.2 m spatial resolution. Challenges in this process may include the need for accurate radiometric calibration, geometric correction, and validation against ground station measured data to ensure precision, as well as dealing with technical issues that may arise during data collection, such as missing data due to experimental problems.",
