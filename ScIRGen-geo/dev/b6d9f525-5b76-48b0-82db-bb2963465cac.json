This diverse array of data sources allows for cross-validation and error checking, enhancing the robustness of the evaporation models. It also helps in addressing the spatial and temporal variability of environmental factors, thereby refining the modeling of long-term water cycles and climate change effects.",

                    "Answer": "The integration of various data inputs, such as CMFD radiation, GLASS surface emissivity, and ERA5-land temperature, can be achieved by using the complementary evapotranspiration method. This involves combining shortwave and longwave radiation data, temperature, and pressure readings with surface emissivity and albedo data. The process requires aligning these datasets in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, which is monthly and at a 0.1° spatial resolution for the region of China. The final output is generated in a NetCDF format, representing land-only actual evapotranspiration values in mm per month.",
