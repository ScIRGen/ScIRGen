            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at Arou Superstation in the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 1 to December 31 in 2021. There were two types of LASs at Arou Superstation: BLS900 and RR-RSS460, produced by Germany and China, respectively. The north tower was set up with the RR-RSS460 receiver and the BLS900 transmitter, and the south tower was equipped with the RR-RSS460 transmitter and the BLS900 receiver. The site (north: 100.471° E, 38.057° N; south: 100.457° E, 38.038° N) was located in Caodaban village of A’rou town in Qilian county, Qinghai Province. The underlying surface between the two towers was alpine meadow. The elevation is 3033 m. The effective height of the LASs was 13.0 m, and the path length was 2390 m. The data were sampled 1 minute at both BLS900 and RR-RSS460.\nThe raw data acquired at 1 min intervals were processed and quality controlled. The data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods, in which sensible heat flux was iteratively calculated by combining Cn2 with meteorological data according to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The main quality control steps were as follows: (1) The data were rejected when Cn2 exceeded the saturated criterion (BLS900: Cn2>7.25E-14, RR-RSS460: Cn2>7.84E-14). (2) The data were rejected when the demodulation signal was small (BLS900: Average X Intensity<1000; RR-RSS460: Demod>-20mv). (3) The data were rejected when collected during precipitation. (4) The data were rejected if collected at night when weak turbulence occurred (u* was less than 0.1 m/s). In the iteration process, the universal functions of Thiermann and Grassl (1992) and Andreas (1988) were selected for BLS900 and RR-RSS460, respectively. Detailed can refer to Liu et al. (2011, 2013). \nSeveral instructions were included with the released data. (1) The data were primarily obtained from BLS900 measurements, and missing flux measurements from the BLS900 instrument were substituted with measurements from the RR-RSS460 instrument. The missing data were denoted by -6999. Due to the problems of storing and wireless transmission. (2) The dataset contained the following variables: Date/time (yyyy/m/d h:mm), the structural parameter of the air refractive index (Cn2, m-2/3), and the sensible heat flux (H, W/m^2). In this dataset, a time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30, and the data were stored in *.xlsx format. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Liu et al. (2011) (for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                "The alpine region is important in riverine and watershed ecosystems as a contributor of freshwater, providing and stimulating specific habitats for biodiversity. In parallel, recent climate change, human activities, and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. Water resources in the alpine region are headwaters that need to be regulated to sustain downstream ecosystems. However, perturbations induced by nature/climate change and human activities in recent years have significantly reformed hydrological processes and eco-functions. Accurate estimation and prediction of hydrological processes and their key impact factors has since become crucial.",
                "Unfortunately, the scarcity of observation data in the alpine region, due to the difficulties of access and technological barriers, has hindered alpine hydrological modeling and associated research yet motivated the development of next-generation ecosystem observation networks and experiments. In comparison with the observations, using remote sensing data combined with data assimilation could improve the prediction of hydrological processes. However, due to the complexities of the earth system, there exist various sources of uncertainties in remote sensing data (especially in the alpine region), which have to be validated and calibrated. In summary, to fill the knowledge gap and promote alpine region hydrology research, an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation dataset is essential and expected to provide accurate forcing data for hydrological modeling, validate remote sensing data, allow the evaluation of distributed models and ultimately improve a predictive understanding of alpine hydrological processes and ecosystem functions. In alpine hydrology, in addition to consistent hydrometeorological data obtained from distributed meteorological stations, snow cover and frozen ground are two important indexes and driving forces that manipulate hydrological processes. The maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) before ablation determines the storage of snowmelt – a major source of freshwater in the alpine region, while freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) and soil moisture within the active layer alter water infiltration and, consequently, surface runoff and groundwater. To promote alpine hydrology research, the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (INARCH) was launched in 2015 by the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), involving 18 catchments around the world. The INARCH has since connected individual observatories into an international network and data-share platform to lead frontier research on alpine region hydrometeorology and snow observation. Another community-based observation network, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, was initiated in the early 1990s to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China and is known for its heterogeneous landscapes, diverse ecosystems, unique geographical characteristics and climate change over recent decades. As a major component of the ecohydrological processes in the arid/semi-arid HRB, the alpine hydrological processes, especially those related to snow cover and frozen ground in the upper reaches, have great impacts on runoff in the mountainous region, which then regulate agricultural development in the middle reaches and the ecosystems of the lower reaches.",
                "In recent years, with climate warming, permafrost degradation has significantly affected runoff and the carbon cycle (Peng et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018). Snow cover is widely distributed with unique characteristics in the study area. In the high-altitude mountainous region (elevation > 3800 m), influenced by the local microclimate and low temperature, snowfall could occur in any season. Temporary snow is the major snow cover type in the region at middle and low elevations because strong solar radiation and high air temperature lead to fast melting and sublimation of the snow. Drifting snow is also commonly observed in the region, which may lead to the redistribution of snowpack in high elevation regions (Essery et al., 1999; Li et al., 2014).",
                "Blowing (drifting) snow is commonly observed in the Qilian mountain due to its high altitude and complex terrain. It is important to estimate the occurrence of blowing snow because it may cause redistributions of the snow cover and influence the sublimation of snow.",
                "Soil heat conductivity is difficult to analyze because it is a function of soil density, soil moisture content (ice content in frozen ground), and soil temperature, which cannot be easily calculated using a simple formula. Therefore, site observations can be utilized to evaluate the parameterization of alpine hydrologic models."

At the basin scale, the observation aims to collect data for investigating the meteorological driving forces and for validation of the alpine hydrological models. At the sub-basin scale, small-scale observations and measurements focus on data such as precipitation, soil temperature and moisture, which are used to develop and improve hydrologic models, as well as to validate remote sensing products at medium to coarse resolutions (Jin et al., 2014). At the two superstations for snow cover and frozen ground observations, remote sensing products can be further validated using fine-resolution data. In total, seven AMSs, as well as the frozen ground and snow superstations (also incorporating meteorological observations), were established in the study area during the intensive observation period (IOP: 2013 -2014) to obtain the spatially distributed meteorological variables. After the IOP, four typical AMSs were selected and retained for continuous observation, which is expected to provide long-term datasets. The observed meteorological variables include wind (speed and direction), air temperature, humidity, infrared temperature, air pressure, four-component radiation, and precipitation. Accumulation and depletion processes were measured automatically at the Yakou snow superstation. The observed components included snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE, measured by GammaMONitor, GMON), albedo of the snow surface and blowing (drifting) snow flux (measured by FlowCapt). Soil temperature and moisture were measured within six layers at each AMS, while evapotranspiration (ET) was observed by eddy covariance (EC) at three AMSs located in permafrost, seasonally frozen ground and a transient zone to observe freeze-thaw (FT) processes. At the sub-basin scale, a wireless sensor network (WSN) with 40 nodes was established to capture seasonal changes in soil temperature and moisture. At the A’rou frozen ground superstation, soil temperature and moisture profiles were intensively measured in eighteen layers to a depth of 3.2 m (in a nested pattern with more layers in the topsoil) to obtain the soil hydrothermal features under freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). In addition, thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil were also measured to observe the dynamic hydrothermal processes within.",

It is difficult to match in situ measurements with a satellite-based ET estimation using the current instrumentation (e.g., the eddy covariance (EC) system or large-aperture scintillometer (LAS)) due to the variations in the orientation, shape and size of the source areas of in situ measurements. However, because of the spatial heterogeneity at the sub-pixel scale, the in situ measurements over heterogeneous land surfaces only approximate the “ground-truth” ET data at the satellite pixel scale (1–10 km for medium-low spatial resolutions) and can introduce errors in the validation results."

The sensible heat flux (LAS-H) was obtained via an iteration method that combines the meteorological data (e.g., wind speed, air temperature, and air pressure) based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Only daytime (10:30–18:00 BST, Beijing standard time) data under unstable conditions were used to acquire the 30-min ET data at the MODIS pixel scale. The automatic weather station (AWS) data were processed to a 30-min average period, and data beyond the range of physical possibility were rejected. The LST data were calculated from downward and upward longwave radiation measured by the AWSs and the surface emissivity measured by the FT-IR spectrometer (102F). The spatial distributions of available energy, air temperature, wind speed, and air pressure from the 21 AWSs in the large experimental area were interpolated to a resolution of 90 m using the inverse distance-weighted method. The flux contributing source area of the EC and LAS measurements can be estimated using the footprint model, and the spatial representative area of the flux can be obtained quantitatively. Three simple upscaling methods for ET were used in this study: the arithmetic average, area-weighted average, and footprint-weighted methods. In this study, ET at the satellite pixel scale was acquired using the Priestley-Taylor equation by combining the land surface temperatures retrieved from remote sensing images."

                    "Answer": "It is difficult to match in situ measurements with a satellite-based ET estimation due to variations in the orientation, shape, and size of the source areas of in situ measurements. Additionally, spatial heterogeneity at the sub-pixel scale means that in situ measurements only approximate 'ground-truth' ET data at the satellite pixel scale, which can introduce errors in validation results.",

                    "Answer": "Remote sensing, when combined with data assimilation and validated against ground observations, has the potential to improve the prediction of hydrological processes in alpine regions. However, uncertainties in remote sensing data due to the complexities of the earth system, especially in alpine environments, need careful validation and calibration. Thus, remote sensing can significantly contribute to expanding datasets, but it must be integrated thoughtfully with ground-based observations to address these uncertainties effectively.",

                    "Answer": "The current suite of datasets, consisting of long-term hydrometeorological, snow cover, and frozen ground data, aims to provide accurate forcing data for alpine hydrological models. While these datasets are expected to serve as a testing platform and support model development, the formidable challenges of the cold climate, high altitude, and complex terrain suggest that further refinement and expansion of datasets may still be necessary to fully support accurate and effective hydrological modeling in alpine regions.",

                    "Answer": "Data from large-aperture scintillometers (LAS) is processed using the structure parameter of the air refractive index and involves iteration methods that combine meteorological data based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. These methods allow for the estimation of sensible heat flux, which is crucial for determining evapotranspiration at the satellite pixel scale and involves upscaling techniques like arithmetic average and footprint-weighted methods.",
