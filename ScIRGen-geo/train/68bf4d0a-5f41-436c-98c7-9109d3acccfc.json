                    "Answer": "In the context of remote sensing datasets, 'multi-angle data acquisition' refers to the capability of a sensor, such as the CHRIS (Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) on the PROBA satellite, to capture images from multiple angles or viewpoints. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of surface features by providing different perspectives, which can enhance the understanding of the surface's biophysical and biochemical properties. The dataset mentioned includes images with five different observational angles for each scene.",

                    "Answer": "The PROBA CHRIS satellite offers a unique combination of high spectral and spatial resolution, as well as multi-angle data collection capabilities, which are not typically available in traditional remote sensing techniques. This allows for more detailed and comprehensive data collection, particularly useful in ecological and hydrological studies where biophysical and biochemical information is crucial. Traditional methods may not simultaneously provide high spectral resolution and multi-angle observations, limiting their ability to capture the same breadth of information.",

                    "Answer": "PROBA CHRIS was selected for collecting remote sensing data due to its exceptional spectral and spatial resolution, along with its unique capability to acquire high spectral and multi-angle data simultaneously. This enables the collection of rich information in biophysical and biochemical aspects, which is particularly beneficial for diverse research purposes involving land, ocean, and inland water bodies. Its ability to provide detailed images from multiple angles enhances the understanding and analysis of ecological and hydrological processes. These attributes make PROBA CHRIS a valuable tool for comprehensive remote sensing observation experiments like those conducted in the Heihe River Basin.",

This sensor is capable of high spectral and spatial resolution imaging, as well as multi-angle data capture. The data is collected at approximately 9:00 AM Beijing time and includes multiple scenes from various observation areas. The data collected is at a Level 1A grade, meaning it has not undergone atmospheric or geometric corrections. Each image scene is captured from five different angles, providing comprehensive multi-angle data. The dataset was acquired through the collaborative efforts of the China-Europe 'Dragon Programme' Phase II and III projects.",
