This data includes the XRF multi-element data of Daze Co and Jiang Co and the age depth data of Lake cores, which can be used to reconstruct the climate and environmental changes in the East and west of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau in the past 20000 years. In Daze Co and Jiang Co lakes, Ti, K, Fe, Si and other elements show the same change trend. Through multi index comparative analysis, it is considered that Ti and other rock forming elements are mainly affected by the inner diameter flow conditions of the basin and can be used to reconstruct the changes of hydrological conditions in the basin in recent 20000 years.",

                    "Answer": "XRF multi-element data is used to determine the relative abundance of major and trace geochemical elements in lake sediment cores, providing insights into historical climate variations. In the Tibetan Plateau, elements such as Ti, K, Fe, and Si are analyzed from lake sediments like those from the 达则错 and 江错 lakes. These elements exhibit similar variation patterns, which are interpreted through comparative analysis with other indicators. The data suggests that the abundance of Ti and other rock-forming elements is influenced by runoff conditions within the watershed, thus serving as a proxy for reconstructing hydrological changes over the past 20,000 years.",

                    "Answer": "Variations in the elemental data obtained from XRF analysis may be due to changes in runoff conditions within the watershed, which influence the distribution of elements like Ti and other rock-forming elements. These elements reflect the hydrological conditions over the past two thousand years in the region, and their consistent trends across different lakes suggest they are primarily affected by watershed processes.",
