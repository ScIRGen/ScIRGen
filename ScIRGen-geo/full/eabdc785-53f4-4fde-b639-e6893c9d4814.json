The geographic coordinates are 30.1741 n, 94.9334 e, and the altitude is 2282m. The underlying surface is grassland.\nThe data include daily arithmetic mean data of air temperature (℃), relative humidity (%), wind speed (M / s), water vapor pressure (kPa) and air pressure (MB) and daily accumulated value of precipitation. The original data is an average value recorded in 10 minutes. The temperature and humidity are measured by hmp155a temperature and humidity probe. The rainfall instrument is tb4, the atmospheric pressure sensor is ptb210, and the wind speed sensor is 05103. These probes are 2 m above the ground. Data quality: the quality of the original data is better, less missing. The data station is a meteorological station in the lower altitude of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, which will be updated from time to time in the future. It can be used by researchers studying climate, hydrology, glaciers, etc.",

                "In mountainous areas, different altitudes exhibit distinct vertical zonation due to variations in water (precipitation) and heat (temperature) components. The Sejila Mountain in southeastern Tibet has a pronounced mountain vertical zonation feature: from the foot of the mountain to the summit, the vegetation types include broadleaf forest, mixed coniferous-broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, shrubs, and moss. The vegetation types in Sejila Mountain are diverse, and the longevity of trees is notable (Lu et al., 2015). The tree line at 4390 m is one of the highest forest tree lines in the world, making it a hotspot for tree-ring and forest ecology research (Wang et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018). Currently, there is limited research on the vertical gradients of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain (Liang et al., 2011). Most studies by some scholars on the changes in temperature and precipitation vertical gradients in this region and its vicinity are primarily based on the data from the Bayi Station (formerly Linzhi Station) and the nearby Bomi Station, focusing on the vertical lapse rate of temperature across the entire Tibetan Plateau (Jiang Jingchao et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2001, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) and precipitation gradients (Guo et al., 2016)."

This not only deepens the understanding of the influence of slope orientation on the vertical gradient changes of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain, but also helps to better understand the physiological and ecological characteristics of plant and animal distribution with altitude changes in the region. Additionally, it provides reliable data support for future hydrological modeling in this watershed area."

Based on the geographical locations of these stations, the stations in the Sejila Mountain area are divided into two natural geographical units according to slope orientation: the west slope (south slope) and the east slope (north slope). The temperature vertical lapse rate and precipitation gradient are estimated, with the Sejila Mountain Pass station belonging to both the west and east slopes. The temperature vertical lapse rate and precipitation gradient are estimated through regression analysis based on the elevation of the stations and the temperature or precipitation amounts."

The average λ from 2013 to 2018 was 0.60 °C·(100 m)^-1.

The eastern slope had λ values between 0.53 and 0.55 °C·(100 m)^-1. Unlike the Selila Mountain and the western slope, the lowest λ in the eastern slope occurred in 2015, while the highest was in 2017, with an average λ of 0.55 °C·(100 m)^-1 from 2013 to 2018. From 2013 to 2018, the average precipitation gradient on the eastern slope was 10.5 mm·(100 m)^-1, with the monsoon period showing a trend of first increasing, then decreasing, and then increasing again with elevation; the non-monsoon period exhibited a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. The precipitation gradient above the southeastern Tibet station was notably significant."

The eastern slope shows a mean temperature lapse rate of 0.55℃ per 100 meters, while the western slope exhibits a higher rate of 0.71℃ per 100 meters.
