            "description": "This data includes the accessibility of 15 kinds of public facilities and services, such as roads and schools, in the communities of 1280 households at domestic and abroad, as well as the farmers' satisfaction with these public facilities and public services by comparing  that with 3 years ago and current status with neighboring village. This data is used to support the analysis of the material capital part of sustainable livelihood. The  data was collected by the research group through field survey in 2019. Before collecting the data, the research group and invited experts conducted a pretest and improved the survey questionnaire; Before the formal investigation, the  members participating in the data collection were strictly trained; In the formal survey, each questionnaire is checked three times before it is filed. This data is of great value for understanding the physical capital accessibility and satisfaction of rural households in environment-economic fragile areas, and is an important supplement to national and macro data.",
