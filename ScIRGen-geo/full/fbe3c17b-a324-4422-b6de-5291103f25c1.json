            "description": "The data set is LA-ICP-MS data of Sphalerite in Lishan Pb Zn Cu polymetallic deposit, Hunan Province. The experimental method was la-icp-ms. The test analysis was completed in Nanjing poly spectrum testing technology Co., Ltd. The 193 nm ArF excimer laser ablation system is manufactured by Teledyne CETAC technologies, and its model is analyte excite; The model of Quadrupole Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) is Agilent 7700x. The deep UV beam generated by the excimer laser generator is focused on the sulfide surface through the homogenized optical path, the energy density is 3.5 J / cm2, and the beam spot diameter is 25 ~ 40 μ m. The frequency is 6 Hz and the ablation time is 40 seconds. The tested elements include 55Mn, 57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni, 65Cu, 66zn, 69Ga, 72ge, 75as, 77Se, 107ag, 111Cd, 118sn, 121Sb and 125Te. The calibration of trace elements was carried out by using the U.S. Geological Survey sulfide briquette mass-1 and basaltic molten glass gse-1g, and the data processing was completed by using the software icpmsdata cal. This data can provide data support for future geochemical model analysis of Lishan Pb Zn Cu polymetallic deposit in Hunan Province.\nThe above data have been published in EI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable. The data is stored in Excel.",
