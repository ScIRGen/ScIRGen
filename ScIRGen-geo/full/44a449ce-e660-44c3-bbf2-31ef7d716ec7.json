            "description": "This dataset provides monthly, daily and hourly near-surface meteorological forcing data for the Third Pole region at a resolution of 1/30°, spanning the period from 1979 to 2022. In this dataset, 2-meter air temperature, 2-meter specific humidity, 10-meter wind speed, surface air pressure and precipitation are generated by combining long-term ERA5 reanalysis, a short-term high-resolution atmospheric simulation and in-situ observations, the downward shortwave is produced by merging ERA5 with a satellite-based solar radiation product, and the downward longwave is calculated using a semi-physical parameterization. Validation demonstrates that the developed dataset generally outperforms currently widely-used reanalysis datasets. This dataset is expected to be beneficial for climate analyses and modeling applications in land surface processes in the TP. ",

                "The Third Pole (TP) region is one of the most complex terrain regions with high elevations and heterogeneous land surfaces, and strong water and energy exchanges between land surface and atmosphere exist in this region. Moreover, it is the source of many large Asian rivers, providing abundant water resources and hydropower within and beyond this region. Reliable gridded precipitation data are essential for understanding hydrological processes, planning water resources and preventing natural hazards in the TP. At present, quasi-global and regional precipitation datasets, including gauge-based products, satellite-based products and reanalysis products, have played an important role over the TP. These datasets include the Asian Precipitation – Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE), the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), the fifth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) and its downscaled version for land applications (ERA5-Land), the High Asia Refined analysis (HAR) and its version 2 (HAR v2), et al. Among these products, gauge-based products may have large errors in the TP, since they are mostly interpolated based on sparse gauge observations. Satellite or satellite–gauge-combined products are most widely used in the TP. However, they are proven to misrepresent solid precipitation and orographic precipitation and show large uncertainties in winter and in the western and southeastern TP. Atmospheric simulation with fine spatial resolution can give reasonable atmospheric water transport and precipitation spatial variability in complex terrain; moreover, it is skillful in estimating solid precipitation. However, current atmospheric simulation-based datasets consistently overestimate precipitation amount in the TP. As a result, substantial differences exist among these datasets in the TP in terms of both amount and spatial variability of precipitation. In addition, these datasets typically have a horizontal resolution coarser than 10 km, which is insufficient to represent the fine-scale precipitation variability and cannot be applied locally. Errors in precipitation products hinder the correct understanding of water cycle processes in the TP. For example, Immerzeel et al. (2015) found that the simulated runoff in the upper Indus using APHRODITE is much smaller than the observations and further confirmed that APHRODITE severely underestimates precipitation amount in this region. Savéan et al. (2015) pointed out that precipitation from rain gauges with poor spatial representativeness leads to irrational runoff component simulations in the central Himalayas. Jiang et al. (2022a) demonstrated that currently widely used satellite-based precipitation products cannot close the basin-scale water budget in the eastern edge of the TP. Some other studies also demonstrated the high uncertainties in current precipitation products for simulations of snow cover, soil moisture and river discharge. Merging multiple precipitation products is an effective way to mitigate precipitation uncertainties. The most commonly used strategy for improving the accuracy of satellite or modeling precipitation is bias correction with gauge observation-based data. For example, Shen et al. (2014) combined the probability density matching and the optimal interpolation to merge the CMORPH and rain gauge data and produced a high-accuracy precipitation dataset over China. Ma et al. (2020, 2022) produced the AIMERG and AERA5-Asia datasets by applying APHRODITE to correct IMERG and ERA5-Land, respectively. Another strategy is merging multiple precipitation products by assigning different weights to these products, in which the weights can be determined by Bayesian-based methods, machine learning or the inverse of errors against gauge data. These methods are flexible and are able to integrate information from multiple sources. Recently, many efforts have been made to merge different precipitation products over the TP; e.g., K. Li et al. (2021) produced a high-accuracy precipitation dataset for the southern TP by merging three satellite-based precipitation datasets with high-density rain gauge data. Y. Wang et al. (2020a) developed a long-term precipitation dataset for the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin by merging data from satellites, reanalysis and rain gauges."

                "First, the ratios are daily precipitation to monthly climatology (i.e., Pdo/Pco and Pde/Pce) in this part. Second, the daily precipitation fields after residual correction (Pd1) are further adjusted to ensure that the sum of the daily precipitation amount in a month is equal to the corresponding monthly precipitation amount obtained in step (2), given that monthly precipitation fields are more reliable due to their smaller spatial variability than daily fields (He et al., 2020). In this study, the RF is combined with the ordinary kriging to interpolate these variables, which is inspired by the regression kriging method, in which the interpolated target is assigned to the spatial trend (deterministic) and the stochastic component (residual). In Eq. (3), the residuals are calculated as follows: first, we calculate the differences between the gauge observations (Pmo or Pdo) and the precipitation estimates from RF at gauge locations; then, the ordinary kriging is used to interpolate the differences. The difference fields are added to the precipitation estimates from RF to obtain the final estimates of precipitation."

In addition, our group has set up more than 80 rain gauges over the TP since 2017, deployed in the Yadong Valley, on the south slope of the Gangdise Range, on the eastern edge of the TP, in the surroundings of Namco and in the inner TP. After the quality control, data from 9798 rain gauges are eventually selected for precipitation merging, and these data have temporal coverages ranging from a few months to more than 40 years. The background precipitation dataset used in this study is called ERA5_CNN, an atmospheric simulation-based dataset, derived from combining a short-term high-resolution WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) simulation with ERA5 reanalysis. ERA5_CNN has a daily temporal resolution, covering the period from 1979 to 2020. Compared with ERA5, ERA5_CNN has a higher horizontal resolution of 1/30° and smaller wet biases over the TP."
