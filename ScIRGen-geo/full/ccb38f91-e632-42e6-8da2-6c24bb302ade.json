            "description": "Based on our field works in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) from 2008 to 2018, and combining data from previous studies, we obtained genetic data of all widely distributed amphibian and reptile species in QTP. Meanwhile, our data covered the whole ranges of all the species. To answer the question: ‘How climatic changes influenced animals of QTP?’, we rebuild the demographic history and analyzed how Quaternary climatic changes impacted animals. Then, we identified the locations of refugia. After constructing spatial pattern of genetic diversity, we identified genetic hotspots which needs more conservation effects. These results are important in biodiversity conservation in QTP.",
