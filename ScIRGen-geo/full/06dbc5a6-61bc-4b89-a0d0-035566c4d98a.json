            "description": "To investigate the paternal genetic structure of Tibetans from Shigatse, 434 male samples were collected from Shigatse, Tibet. Firstly, SNP genotyping was performed to allocate samples into haplogroups. To further evaluate the genetic diversity of the major Y-chromosomal haplogroup in Tibetan populations from Lhasa, eight commonly used Y-chromosomal STR (short tandem repeat) loci (DYS19, DYS388, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, and DYS393) were genotyped using fluorescence-labeled primers with an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The results indicated that haplogroup O-M175 displayed highest frequency in Shigatse Tibetans (47.00%, the majority of its sublineages were O2-M122), followed by haplogroups D-M174 (40.78%, with most of the samples belonging to D-P47 (20.97%) and D-N1(16.82%)). Another relatively rare lineages in Shigatse Tibetans were C-M217 (1.84%), R1a1- M17 (1.61%), N1-LLY22G (5.76%), Q-M242 (0.69%). In combination with the data from Lhasa that released in 2019, our Y chromosome data of Tibetans from different locations on the Tibetan Plateau will be very helpful to understanding the paternal genetic structure of Tibetans. Moreover, the genetic history of Tibetans can also be dissected by phylogeographic and coalescent analyses.",

                    "Answer": "Using different SNP genotyping methods can result in varying degrees of accuracy and resolution in determining haplogroup affiliations, which can further impact the insights into genetic diversity. For the Shigatse Tibetan population, employing varied methods might enrich the understanding of prevalent haplogroups like O-M175, D-M174, and others, revealing more detailed genetic histories and variations that might not be captured with a single method.",

This analysis helps to reveal the most frequent haplogroups, such as O-M175 and D-M174 in the Shigatse Tibetan population, and facilitates comparisons with other populations, thereby uncovering historical and phylogenetic relationships among different groups.",
