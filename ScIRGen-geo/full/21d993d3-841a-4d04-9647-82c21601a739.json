            "description": "The 1 km / 5-day FVC data set of Heihe River basin provides the 5-day FVC synthesis results from 2011 to 2014. The data uses the data of Terra / MODIS, Aqua / MODIS, and domestic satellites fy3a / MERSI and fy3b / MERSI to build a multi-source remote sensing data set with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a time resolution of 5 days. The whole country is divided into different vegetation divisions and land types, and the conversion coefficient of NDVI and FVC is calculated respectively. The conversion coefficient look-up table and 1km / 5-day synthetic NDVI product production area 1km / 5-day synthetic FVC product are used. In the Heihe River Basin, 1 km / 5-day synthetic FVC products can directly obtain vegetation coverage ratio through high-resolution data to reduce the impact of low-resolution data heterogeneity; in addition, select the typical period of vegetation growth and change, obtain the corresponding growth curve parameters of each pixel by fitting the vegetation index of each pixel time series; and then cooperate with land use map and vegetation classification map, To find the representative uniform pixel of the region to train the conversion coefficient of vegetation index. Compared with the results of high-resolution aster reference FVC in Heihe River Basin, the first step is to aggregate the aster products in Heihe River basin to 1km scale by combining the measured ground data and using the scale up method, and to obtain the aster aggregate FVC data, which is based on spot vegetation remote sensing data released by geoland 2 project (geov1 for short) The results show that the results of geov1 are higher than those of ASTER image combined with ground measurement, and the results of 1 km / 5-day synthetic FVC products in Heihe River Basin are between the two, and the results of 1 km / 5-day synthetic FVC products in Heihe River Basin in the experimental area are better than those of geov1 products. In a word, the comprehensive utilization of multi-source remote sensing data to improve the estimation accuracy and time resolution of FVC parameter products can better serve the application of remote sensing data products.",

It characterizes the fraction of vegetation on a flat background covered by vegetation, thereby accounting for the amount of vegetation distributed in a horizontal perspective. For such, an accurate assessment of FVC is mandatory for a thorough description of land surface processes in the surface parameterization schemes implemented in the climate and weather forecasting models. Besides, the FVC is relevant for a wide range of Land Biosphere Applications such as agriculture and forestry, environmental management and land use, hydrology, natural hazards monitoring and management, vegetation-soil dynamics monitoring, drought conditions and fire scar extent. Two main approaches exist to estimate FVC and other bio-physical parameter like Leaf Area Index (LAI). The first one is based upon empirical relationships with vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The second one relies on radiative transfer models inverted by neural network or look-up tables. The scattering, absorption and reflection processes in the foliage layer are accurately simulated by equations of the radiative transfer theory."
