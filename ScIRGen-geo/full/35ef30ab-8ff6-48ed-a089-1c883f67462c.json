            "description": "Nepal is in the southern Tibetan Plateau. The Cenozoic strata developed in Nepal contain fruitful information on the tectonic evolution, paleoenvironment and paleoclimate changes. It's very significant in revealing the history of the uplift and deformation of the Tibetan Plateau and its relevant effects on the regional and even global environment and climate. This data set contains several well-developed Cenozoic sections from northern and central Nepal, which have been identified by the systematic geological survey. Depending on the tools (e.g. GPS, geological compass) in the fieldwork, we have finished the geological measurements and descriptions of these sections as well as the relevant geological maps. The Butwa section is located in the Tansen area of central Nepal, about 320-m deposit with coals and consists of Taltung Formation, Amile Formation, Bhainskati Formation and Dumri Formation from bottom to top. The Kalyan section is in the northwestern Birendranagar of northern Nepal, about 1160-m deposit with biogenic limestones and abundant microfossils. The lower part is Bhainskati Formation and the upper part is Dumri Formation. This data set provides a solid geological foundation for the following research in the southern Tibetan Plateau on stratigraphic chronology, tectonic evolution, paleoenvironment and paleoclimate, and so forth.",
