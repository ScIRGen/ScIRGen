            "description": "Paleozoic strata are well developed in the western Thailand area, but the detailed palaeontological research is still lacking for the Ordovician in study area. Abundant conodonts and cephalopod samples from the Tha Manao Formation in western Thailand (Sibumasu terrane, Dapingian Wat Mong Kratae section, GPS coordinates: 14°25′57″ N, 99°7′23″) were collected and identified in this study, constraining the age of Dapingian, and correlating to the Hunghuayuan Formation of South China. This dataset includes the stratigraphic column of the Tha Manao Formation section and outcrop photos in the western Thailand.",

In the context of Paleozoic stratigraphy and paleontology research, it is used to document the complete exposure of Paleozoic strata, such as those found in western Thailand at the Wat Mong Kratae section. It includes data on fossil content, which in this case comprises cephalopods and conodonts, and helps establish a chronological framework that can be compared to other geological formations, such as the Honghuayuan Formation in South China.",

                    "Answer": "The objectives include establishing a high-resolution stratigraphic framework and conducting comprehensive paleontological research, as the Paleozoic strata in western Thailand are well-exposed but under-researched. The collected fossils help define the age of the Tha Manao group as the Darriwilian stage and allow for comparisons with similar strata like the Honghuayuan Group in South China.",

                    "Answer": "In western Thailand, specifically at the Wat Mong Kratae section, Paleozoic fossils such as cephalopods and conodonts are collected and identified from the Tha Manao group. The procedures likely include precise field mapping and sampling at GPS coordinates (14°25′57″ N, 99°7′23″ E), followed by laboratory analysis and identification of fossils to establish a biostratigraphic framework. This process helps determine the age of the strata (Daiping period) and enables correlation with related formations, such as the Honghuayuan group in South China. The dataset includes stratigraphic columns and field section photographs, which aid in the comprehensive understanding of the region's stratigraphic and paleontological context.",
