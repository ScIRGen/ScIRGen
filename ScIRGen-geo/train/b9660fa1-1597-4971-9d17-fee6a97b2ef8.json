            "description": "Landslide drainage and seepage prevention is a common technology for the treatment of landslide source area in Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The existing siphon drainage technology is inefficient when applied to high altitude areas. Through improvement, a variable pipe diameter and high head siphon drainage technology is proposed to solve the deep drainage problem of landslide in high altitude and low pressure areas. 12 groups of siphon drainage tests with variable pipe diameter were carried out to verify the correctness of the theoretical velocity calculation formula. The test results show that the theoretical calculation results of siphon velocity are in good agreement with the test results, and the relative error of theoretical calculation is within 5%; Different schemes of variable pipe diameter increase the siphon flow rate by 15% - 116%. It can be seen that variable pipe diameter can significantly enhance the drainage capacity of siphons, especially for high lift siphons.",

This environmental challenge affects the effectiveness of the drainage systems, leading to the development of the variable-diameter high-lift siphon drainage technology as a solution. Data collection methods for testing these improved drainage solutions involve conducting multiple experimental trials, specifically 12 sets of variable-diameter siphon drainage experiments, to verify theoretical flow rate calculations. These experiments help ensure that the improved methods function effectively under the unique conditions of high-altitude, low-pressure environments.",
