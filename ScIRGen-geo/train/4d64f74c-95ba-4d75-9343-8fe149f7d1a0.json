            "description": "This data set is the global 1km resolution population spatial distribution (Future Population, FPOP) data under the SSP scenario. This data set incorporates fine built-up land use changes under the SSP scenario to describe the impact of built-up land use changes on population spatial changes. Machine Learning is used to conduct future population spatial simulations consistent with SSP scenarios, and produce global long-term series, full coverage, high-resolution, and high-precision gridded future population data under five SSP scenarios. The time range covers 2020 to 2100 (10-year interval), and the spatial resolution is 1km. Global future gridded population data with fine resolution can be used to assess future extreme disasters, economic development, social vulnerability, and other aspects of research.",
