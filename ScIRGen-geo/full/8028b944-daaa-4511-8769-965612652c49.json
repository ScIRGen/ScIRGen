In high altitude regions, SWD has become an important energy source for local people, due to the difficulties of long-distance energy supply. Meanwhile, downward longwave radiation (LWD) is an important parameter for frost prediction and for crop growing. There are only a few investigations that had been done to study the radiation conditions of high altitude regions."

This paper presents a pilot study over TP, the highest and largest plateau in the world. First, we investigate the characteristics of shortwave and longwave radiations over high altitude regions, and point out a necessary condition for a model to be applicable over high altitude regions. Then, we evaluate two types of estimates (surface data-based estimate and satellite data-based estimate) against a long-term instrumental data set over TP."

Therefore, suitable instrumental SWD and LWD data are invaluable but they are rarely available, and an effective method developed for estimating radiation occurring over high altitude regions is very important and urgently needed."

In this study, CMA provides long-term data sets of daily-mean air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine duration, and pressure, and thus provides a possibility to extend radiation data from satellite era to earlier decades. For the surface radiation modeling in this study, SWD is estimated by a hybrid model and LWD is estimated by CD99 model. At four CMA stations (SQH, Gerze, Naqu, Anduo) where experimental radiation data are available, SWD was estimated from CMA daily data of sunshine duration, air temperature, air pressure, and humidity by the hybrid model. The estimated SWD data together with CMA air temperature and humidity data were supplied into CD99 model, which, in turn, estimated LWD values."

On the contrary, SWD over TP is significantly higher than that over its surrounding areas, due to low extinction rate of airmass, water vapor, and aerosol occurred in TP. It is found that the surface data-based estimate, though not calibrated locally, shows a good agreement with the measurements and has an advantage of producing less root-mean-square errors and higher correlation coefficients than the satellite estimates."

On the other, the generation of such datasets necessitates ground-based observations as inputs. However, observations at only a small fraction of weather stations from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) are shared world-wide via the Global Telecommunication System (GTS), which prevents data developers from improving their dataset quality over China."

            "methods": [
                "The ground-based observations used in this study come from two data sources: those acquired from CMA’s CMDC are daily data from approximately 700 stations, while those from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) are sub-daily data with only 300–400 stations available over China for most years. Because both datasets are CMA weather station data, we will not distinguish them, and collectively call them CMA data throughout the remainder of this paper. The core of the algorithms for temperature, pressure, specific humidity and wind speed is summarized in Fig. 2a. The five main steps in this algorithm are listed as follows. (1) Interpolate 3-hourly gridded background data (GLDAS or MERRA) at the location of each CMA weather station. (2) Subtract interpolated background data from step (1) by 3-hourly observations at each station, obtaining the discrepancies between these two kinds of datasets. (3) Interpolate these discrepancies from stations to 0.1° grid points using ANUSPLIN software. (4) Remap the background data from its resolution to 0.1° grid. (5) Add the gridded discrepancies in step (3) to the output of step (4), to get the corrected data product. The procedure for generating downward shortwave radiation data (Fig. 2b) is different to that for generating temperature, pressure, specific humidity, and wind speed. The procedure for generating downward shortwave radiation data is listed as follows. (1) Interpolate 3-hourly gridded background data (GLDAS or GEWEX-SRB) at the location of each CMA weather stations. (2) Estimate the daily mean downward shortwave radiation with the hybrid model based on weather station data. (3) Calculate the ratio of the data from step (2) and the daily mean downward shortwave radiation from step (1). (4) Interpolate the ratio from stations to 0.1° grid points and obtain the gridded ratio. (5) Remap the background data from its resolution to 0.1° grid. (6) Multiply the gridded ratio in step (4) with the 3-hourly output of step (5), to get the corrected data product. First, we made a 0.1-degree, 3-hourly precipitation dataset through the interpolation algorithm similar to that of the temperature; the interpolation uses observational and 3-hourly gridded precipitation background data as inputs (see the upper-left block in Fig. 2c). Second, a 0.1-degree, monthly precipitation dataset was made using the same interpolation algorithm, but using monthly observational and gridded precipitation background data as inputs (see the upper-right block in Fig. 2c). Third, the ratio of this monthly precipitation data and the monthly precipitation derived from the 3-hourly precipitation dataset is calculated on each grid cell for each month. The ratio is then used as a correction factor to multiply the 3-hourly precipitation values on the grid for the month, which yields the final precipitation product (see the lower block in Fig. 2c)."
