The basic data is based on data collection, satellite observation, literature and other methods. The emission inventory of 3km * 3km biomass burning sources is established. The data in the work comes from the FAO, MODIS satellite data and scientific literature, and its quality can be guaranteed. The data can be used for further study of climate change and air quality in the third polar region.",
