            "titleEn": "Pricipitation-driven TWSA dataset in Chinese mainland (2002-2022)",
            "description": "This dataset is derived using precipitation reconstruction method. A reconstruction model is developed by selecting precipitation and temperature data with high accuracy for the Chinese mainland and calibrating them with CSR RL06 Mascon data from 2003-2016. Based on this reconstructed model, the precipitation driven TWSA is calculated for 2002-2022 at 0.5° resolution. The precipitation data in 2002-2019 are from CGDPA, temperature data are from CN05.1, and the precipitation and temperature data in 2020-2022 are from the CLDAS-2.0 dataset. Since the CGDPA and CN05.1 datasets are not available in Taiwan, no reconstruction is performed for Taiwan. This dataset contains 7 parameters: Decimal_time, lat, lon, T_P-TWS, time, time_bounds, and TWSA_REC. Among them, lon and lat denote the longitude and latitude ranges of the data. Time_bounds and time denote the observation periods and mean time of the data since January 1, 2002, which is consistent with the GRACE observation period. Decimal_time indicates the decimal time corresponding to the data. TWSA_REC is the reconstructed precipitation-driven TWSA, and T_P-TWS indicates the contribution of long-term precipitation change to the water storage trend. The accuracy of this dataset is generally good in Chinese mainland, but there are some outliers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang. This dataset can provide a scientific reference for the study of the separation of different drivers in regional terrestrial water storage, climate change and human activities in China.",
            "instructions": "The data files are titled as CSRM_TWSAPD_Rec2002_2022.nc, saved in NetCDF format, and can be read using MATLAB, Python, ArcGIS, etc. In addition, tif files of precipitation-driven TWSA with T_P-TWS factors are provided in this dataset to ensure that users can read them in ArcGIS.",

This approach improves data precision over the Chinese mainland; however, it may introduce anomalies in regions like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang.

The data is calibrated with CSR RL06 Mascon data for the period 2003-2016 to develop a reconstruction model.
