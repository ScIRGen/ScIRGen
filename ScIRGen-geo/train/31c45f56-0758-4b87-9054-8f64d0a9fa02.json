            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace element data, whole rock SR Nd isotopic data, zircon U-Pb dating data and zircon Lu Hf isotopic data of Yangshan A-type granite in eastern China. The major element data of the whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the zircon U-Pb dating and in-situ Lu Hf isotopic composition data were obtained by la-mc-icp-ms analysis. The whole rock SR Nd isotopes were obtained by MC – ICP – MS analysis. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals, and the data are true and reliable. Based on the data obtained, the geochemical characteristics of the two phases of Jiuhuashan pluton can be preliminarily studied. Thus, we can better understand the crystallization differentiation and provenance of these A-type granites, and provide key constraints for the tectonic evolution of the eastern Jiangnan orogenic belt.",
