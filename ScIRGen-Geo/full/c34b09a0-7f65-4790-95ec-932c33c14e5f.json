      "description": "This data set is a granitoid geological data set in hengduan Mountain area, which is located in western Sichuan, eastern Tibet and western Yunnan in the eastern part of qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The area is bounded by the Ailaoshan-Jinshajiang deep fault, the Kang-Dian ancient land of the Yangtze plate in Eurasia to the east, and the Ancient Tethis-Himalayan tectonic zone to the west. From Precambrian to Tertiary, the granitoids in hengduan Mountains are well developed from neutral, acidic to alkaline, and are distributed in bands. Due to the change of granite types caused by tectonic evolution, multiple types of granites are distributed in the same rock belt, thus forming the composite rock belt. The original data of this data set is digitized from the book \"Granite Geochemistry in Hengduan Mountains\". This data set provides basic data for the study of Hengduan Mountains and has reference value for the study of related fields.",
      "descriptionCn": "本数据集为横断山区花岗岩类地质数据集，横断山区地处青藏高原东部之川西、藏东和滇西等广大地区。该区以哀牢山-金沙江深断裂为界，以东为欧亚大陆扬子板块的康滇古陆，以西为古特提斯-喜马拉雅构造区。横断山区的花岗岩类时代，从前寒武纪到第三纪，岩性从中性、酸性到碱性都非常发育且呈带状分布。由于构造演化导致了花岗岩类型的改变，使同一条岩带中分布着多种成因类型的花岗岩类，因而构成了复合岩带。该数据集原始数据数字化自《横断山区花岗岩类地球化学》一书，本数据集对于研究横断山区提供了基础数据，对于相关领域的研究具有参考价值。",
