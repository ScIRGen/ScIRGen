            "description": "This dataset is a global land surface evapotranspiration product with a spatial resolution of 0.25 and a temporal resolution of daily independently developed by Jin Jiaxin's team at Hohai University. Raw datas include GLDAS meteorological reanalysis data, MODIS land cover data, GLASS LAI , FPAR, CSIF fluorescence data, CO2 reanalysis data, and FLUXNET 2015 flux site observations. Firstly, we used SIF and LAI to characterize vegetation growth and developed a method for estimating the conductance slope, which is the key to the ‘Gs-A’ mode. Then, based on the optimized conductance-photosynthesis model and the P-M equations, we used spatially-driven data to estimate the stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration of the vegetation canopy. Thirdly, we calculated the evaporation of vegetation from soils by the P-M model, and calculated the intercept evapotranspiration by the Biome-BGC model's canopy interception module. Finally, we combined all three calculations to produce the evapotranspiration of the land surface for the years 2010 to 2020.",

                    "Answer": "The '导度-光合' model refers to a methodology that integrates stomatal conductance and photosynthesis parameters to estimate key elements like the conductance slope parameter. It uses indicators such as solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and leaf area index (LAI) to assess vegetation growth status and combines this with flux tower and meteorological data to optimize the model for estimating canopy stomatal conductance and transpiration.",

                    "Answer": "Space-based SIF and LAI data provide a broad view of vegetation growth conditions and are used in the 'conductance-photosynthesis' model to estimate stomatal conductance and canopy transpiration. In contrast, FLUXNET2015 offers ground-based flux measurements, providing detailed, localized observations. Combining these approaches allows for a comprehensive estimation by integrating spatial coverage and localized accuracy, enhancing the global terrestrial evapotranspiration product from 2010 to 2020.",

The use of SIF and LAI to indicate vegetation growth, combined with site flux and meteorological data, helps establish estimation schemes for key parameters in models like the 'conductance-photosynthesis' model. The optimization of these models, along with the use of the Penman-Monteith equation and Biome-BGC model for different components of evapotranspiration, contribute to the overall accuracy and development of the products.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating satellite-based sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data with ground-measured meteorological data can enhance the accuracy and reliability of global terrestrial evapotranspiration datasets by improving the representation of vegetation growth conditions and stomatal conductance estimations. This integration allows for a more comprehensive model that accounts for both spatially resolved remote sensing inputs and localized flux measurements, leading to refined parameter estimation and model optimization, which consequently can produce more reliable evapotranspiration estimates across diverse global landscapes.",
