            "description": "This dataset is the spatial distribution map of the marshes in the source area of the Yellow River near the Zaling Lake-Eling Lake, covering an area of about 21,000 square kilometers. The data set is classified by the Landsat 8 image through an expert decision tree and corrected by manual visual interpretation. The spatial resolution of the image is 30m, using the WGS 1984 UTM projected coordinate system, and the data format is grid format. The image is divided into five types of land, the land type 1 is “water body”, the land type 2 is “high-cover vegetation”, the land type 3 is “naked land”, and the land type 4 is “low-cover vegetation”, and the land type 5 is For \"marsh\", low-coverage vegetation and high-coverage vegetation are distinguished by vegetation coverage. The threshold is 0.1 to 0.4 for low-cover vegetation and 0.4 to 1 for high-cover vegetation.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating meteorological data from multiple international sources with local observational data can enhance the accuracy and reliability of a dataset by providing a more comprehensive background field. This approach allows for the cross-validation and correction of data anomalies, thereby improving the overall quality of the dataset. However, it may also introduce challenges such as inconsistencies in measurement standards, spatial and temporal resolution disparities, and potential biases inherent in different datasets. Addressing these challenges requires careful data assimilation techniques and the use of advanced algorithms to harmonize the data effectively.",

This integration aims to improve the accuracy and detail of near-surface meteorological and environmental factors analysis, providing a robust foundation for environmental research and applications over the specified region from 1979 to 2016.",
