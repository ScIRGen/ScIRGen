            "description": "This dataset is a global satellite-based precipitation fusion-calibration product with a spatial-temporal resolution of 25km/3hr, independently developed by Dr. Yong Bin's team at Hohai University. The original data sources include the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) IMERG-Early satellite precipitation estimates and ground observation from Climate Prediction Center (CPC). The development process involved establishing error correction models based on the rainfall intensity from IMERG-Early and CPC datasets for different terrains, climatic zones, and seasons during the period of 2010-2014. Subsequently, the models were applied to perform real-time error correction for IMERG-Early (25km/1day, 60°N-60°S) from 2015-2020 years incorporating by terrain information, and climatic zone files. Further steps involved downscaling and resampling to achieve a spatial-temporal resolution of 25km/3hr. Finally, for the high-latitude region (90°N-60°N) and the China region (15°N-59°N, 70°E-140°E), ERA5 data and fusion precipitation data based on random forest were incorporated, respectively. The experiment result shows that the BIAS of the ILSF-RT precipitation dataset is less than 15% at a global scale. The development of the algorithm and the production of this dataset are of significant importance in enhancing the accuracy of mainstream real-time satellite-based precipitation products. It also greatly enhances the potential application of real-time satellite-based precipitation products in natural disaster forecasting and early warning.",

However, the currently operational near-real-time SPEs still have larger errors and uncertainties.",
                "A comprehensive investigation with regard to the relationships between retrieval errors and four factors (i.e., topography, seasonality, climate type, and rain rate) is still lacking. By analyzing the error components of GPM-based passive microwave (PMW) and infrared sensors, for the first time, we comprehensively revealed the dependency of retrieval errors of satellite precipitation on the topography, season, and climate type over mainland China. Furthermore, a power function relationship between retrieval errors and logarithm of rain rates was subsequently proposed in the extended study. In practice, many previous literatures have proposed various correction methods to improve the accuracy of the near-real-time SPPs for enhancing their potentials in natural hazard forecasting. However, these correction methods suffer from different defects: 1) some methods strongly depend on the ground observations in real-time and their effectiveness is also closely related to the observed accuracy; 2) some methods used the satellite-derived soil moisture products to correct SPEs in real-time, but these ways may introduce new error sources and degrade the retrieval quality of original SPPs; 3) others only selected single or few factors but neglected some crucial ones associated with retrieval errors, leading to the fundamental algorithmic defects in establishing the EAMs; and 4) some real-time error correction methods work for only reducing systematic error, but the major error component of current satellite products is random error. Merging different precipitation products is an effective way to enhance the quality of SPPs. However, it cannot correct SPEs in real-time.",
                "Our previous studies have found that the errors of the satellite-based precipitation estimates are closely related to four crucial factors, i.e., seasonality, topography, climate type, and rain rate. However, the comprehensive relationships between satellite retrieval errors and these four factors are still not investigated, and the expected EAM was also not established. Based on the SPF relationships adaptive for 16 different categories, we proposed a novel bias adjustment method to correct the hourly GSMaP-NRT estimates in real-time.",
                "With the rapid development of remote sensing technique in the past 20 years, the retrieval information from various satellite sensors becomes a reliable data source of obtaining areal precipitation estimates over large scales and even globe. Although the satellite-based precipitation estimates are indirect, the high frequency and broad coverage make them uniquely complementary to conventional rain gauge networks and weather radars. Also, the satellite-based precipitation estimates provide an opportunity for both hydrologists and meteorologists to improve the forecasting of extreme events, such as flood warning, landslide detection, typhoon monitoring, and drought diagnosis, at the large scale. In practice, the near-real-time satellite precipitation products (SPPs) are more appropriate for these hydrometeorological predictions relative to post-real-time research quality SPPs. However, the near-real-time SPPs normally have larger errors and uncertainties than the post-real-time products. Therefore, it is important to develop effective error correction methods for further improving the data accuracy of mainstream SPPs in real-time, which will significantly enhance their application potentials especially for natural hazard warning. The scientific understanding of error features of satellite precipitation estimates (SPEs) is essential to establish the error adjustment model (EAM) in correction methods."

Consequently, here we proposed a novel real-time error adjustment method that considers four impacting factors to precipitation errors to correct for the hourly GSMaP-NRT precipitation estimates in real-time.",

Despite that the new method shows great advantages for error corrections in real-time relative to the existing real-time error correction methods, it also cannot reduce missed precipitation and its limited improvements in reducing false errors. In addition, this method has another common problem also inherent in the existing algorithms, that is, underestimating the rainfall volume in the rain rates over 1 mm hr−1.",
                "However, the results of bias score show that the current method seems unsuitable to adjust the rainfall events with higher rain rates (>= 1m mh r −1), which needs to be further improved."

                "In our study, the hourly GSMaP-NRT was first corrected by the proposed method to produce a set of new precipitation product ILSF-RT, which was then intercompared with both GSMaP-NRT and GSMaP-Gauge-NRT to validate the new approach.",
                "In the new correction method, we design a better expression for topography using the standard deviation of elevation [SDE, see Fig. 1(b)] to substitute the original average elevation. The retrieval errors (E) can be simply calculated by satellite rain rate (S) minus ground observations (G). In our numerical experiments, we found that the condition number of matrix A T A is beyond 1000, which causes its determinant close to zero, resulting in matrix AT A seriously ill-conditioned. Therefore, an ILS approach was applied to perform the parameter estimates of X for the 16 EAMs. The procedure of RILS-based outlier elimination mainly includes the following four steps. The ILS method was used to compute the initial parameter estimates of the 16 EAMs [i.e., (2)]. The distances (d) between the selected points and the fitting plane were calculated by substituting parameter estimates, S, SDE, and E into the following equation. Thus, the standard deviation of the distance (σ) could be worked out using the following formula pair. If di < 3σ, the corresponding training sample will be retained to join the following training. Otherwise, it will be eliminated as an outlier. Calculating the errors of satellite estimates. Establishing 16 EAMs based on the analyses of four crucial factors. Removing the outliers. Calibrating the model parameters of EAMs.",
                "The new method primarily adopts the ILS method to solve the parameter estimates of the EAMs that consider four factors, and then the errors and biases of GSMaP-NRT are reduced based on (4) and (6). Finally, the ILSF-RT product was comprehensively intercompared with GSMaP-NRT and GSMaP-Gauge-NRT over mainland China for validation using various evaluation indices. To quantify the performance of the new proposed method, we used seven statistical indices including correlation coefficient (CC), root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), relative bias (RBIAS), and three types of error components (hit bias, miss bias, and false bias)."

Meanwhile, the new method effectively reduces the errors of GSMaP-NRT associated with seasonality and climate (see Figs. 4 and 5). In particular, this new proposed method evidently improves the data quality over arid areas and cold seasons (spring and winter), which improves the application potentials of GSMaP-NRT in such areas where no ground observations are not available. Overall, the new method proposed in this study considers the relationships between retrieval errors and four crucial factors, and the verification results have proved the effectiveness in reducing the retrieval errors.",
                "The results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the retrieval errors of GSMaP-NRT for various terrains and rain rates over different seasons and climate-type areas. The new ILSF-RT even exhibits a general improvement over the GSMaP-Gauge-NRT estimates. One important merit of the new method is that it can perform rather well in validation even when not much historical data were applied as training samples in calibration. Overall, we can conclude that the new proposed method can substantially improve the data accuracy of hourly GSMaP-NRT estimates and even perform better than the gauged adjustment scheme used in GSMaP-Gauge-NRT. The spatial analyses from Fig. 6 demonstrate that the new method effectively reduces the retrieval errors of GSMaP-NRT for various terrains and over different seasons and climate areas and ILSF-RT generally exhibits the best performance among three evaluation products."
