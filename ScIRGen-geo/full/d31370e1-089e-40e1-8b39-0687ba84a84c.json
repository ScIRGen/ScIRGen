            "description": "Using the analytic hierarchy process, this study selects eight assessment factors and assesses the comprehensive quality of eight glacier inventories of the TPR by grading. By merging products of the eight glacier inventories in terms of best-quality assessment units, A new glacier inventory product of best comprehensive quality was derived for the entire TPR. The new product greatly promotes the quality of a single glacier inventory for the entire TPR. \nThe database provides: (1) glacier information inherited from the original inventories including longitude, latitude, area, elevation, slope, aspect, acquisition time of the remote-sensing data; (2) information of the assessment including normalized index values of the eight assessment factors, integrated index values and grades of scenes for all of the eight inventories, which is recorded in terms of individual glaciers. It would meet the needs not only for the potential users who need to know the best glacier inventory of comprehensive quality of a region, but also for those who prefer to get information on a single quality or factor (e.g. seasonal snowcover) of a given glacier inventory.",
