            "description": "This dataset includes annual non-photosynthetic vegetation cover data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau grassland from 2000 to 2020. This dataset is a spatial distribution dataset of non-photosynthetic vegetation cover (fNPV) in grassland on the  Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is estimated by using the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) to construct a dimidiate pixel  model of non-photosynthetic vegetation on the basis of the MODIS 500m resolution surface reflectance product MOD09A1. The data format is TIF, and the projection coordinate system is Alberts Conical Equal Area, which can provide a basis for dynamic monitoring of non-photosynthetic vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",
            "instructions": "The non-photosynthetic vegetation cover data of grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is stored in a TIF format raster file named \"fNPV_XXXX. tif\", where XXXX represents the year, such as fNPV_2020, editing and other operations can be performed in ArcGIS software.",
