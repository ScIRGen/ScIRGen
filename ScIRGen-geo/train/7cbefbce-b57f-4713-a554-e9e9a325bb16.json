            "description": "Water scarcity，food crises and ecological deterioration caused by drought disasters are a direct threat to food security and socio-economic development. Improvement of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management is now urgently required. This article describes major scientific and technological progress in the field of drought disaster risk assessment. Drought is a worldwide natural disaster that has long affected agricultural production as well as social and economic activities. Frequent droughts have been observed in the Belt and Road area, in which much of the agricultural land is concentrated in fragile ecological environment. Soil relative moisture index is one of the indicators that characterize soil drought. It is the ratio of soil relative humidity to field water holding capacity, which can directly reflect the availability of water for crops.The soil moisture data is obtained from the SMAP remote sensing soil moisture data product through the downscaling method, and the field water holding capacity data comes from the Hamonized World Soil Database (HWSD). For detailed calculation formulas and methods, please refer to: \"National Standard for Agricultural Drought Grades of China\"  No.: GB/T 32136-2015. The data covers 34 key node areas along the Belt and Road.",

                    "Answer": "The method of deriving soil relative humidity indices utilizes SMAP remote sensing soil moisture data products, which are processed through downscaling techniques to achieve the required resolution. This approach allows for extensive spatial coverage, especially across large and ecologically fragile regions such as those along the 'Belt and Road.' In contrast, field-based soil moisture measurements typically offer higher accuracy at specific locations but lack the broad spatial coverage provided by remote sensing. The latter method also incorporates field capacity data from the global soil database, HWSD, to calculate the soil relative humidity index, which directly reflects the available water status for crops.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges in data collection and accuracy for assessing soil relative humidity drought indices using remote sensing technologies are influenced by the variability in spatial and temporal scales of droughts, the precision in the downscaling of SMAP remote sensing soil moisture data, and the reliability of field capacity data from global soil databases like HWSD. Additionally, the ecological vulnerability and concentrated agricultural lands in the Belt and Road regions, along with the frequent occurrence of droughts, make it difficult to maintain consistent and accurate monitoring. These factors necessitate advanced methodologies for improving drought risk assessment and emergency management technologies.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing remote sensing data to monitor drought frequency and intensity in these regions can enhance the accuracy and timeliness of drought risk assessments by providing large-scale, consistent, and timely data. This enables a comprehensive understanding of drought patterns and their spatial-temporal variations, which is crucial for improving drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management. The ability to systematically track changes can inform better resource management and policy decisions, potentially mitigating the adverse effects on water scarcity, food security, and ecological degradation.",

                    "Answer": "The goal is to assess the frequency and intensity of droughts, which are increasing due to global warming, and to address the challenges of water scarcity, food crises, and ecological degradation such as desertification. This dataset is intended to support drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management, particularly in the ecologically fragile Belt and Road regions where agriculture is concentrated and droughts occur frequently. By using remote sensing satellites to monitor large areas for drought levels and their spatiotemporal changes, the dataset aims to provide scientific insights into drought patterns and regional differentiation characteristics, and to evaluate their impact on agricultural land.",

                    "Answer": "The soil relative humidity drought index is derived using remote sensing data from the SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite, which provides soil moisture data. This data is then downscaled to achieve higher spatial resolution. The relative humidity index is calculated as the ratio of soil relative humidity to field capacity, which reflects the available water for crops. The field capacity data is sourced from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD). For a detailed methodology, one can refer to the 'National Standard for Agricultural Drought Levels' (GB/T 32136-2015). This approach allows for monitoring and assessing drought levels and their impact on agriculture across large regions, like those along the Belt and Road Initiative.",
