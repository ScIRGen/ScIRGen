            "titleEn": "Hf isotopic data of zircon from host rocks of luokuidong molybdenum deposit, Hainan Island",
            "description": "The Hf isotope data of zircon from the host rock of luokuidong molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island were tested by the State Key Laboratory of isotope geochemistry, Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017-2019. After crushing the whole rock sample to about 40-60 mesh, the zircon particles with good crystal form were manually selected by magnetic separation and heavy liquid separation under binocular lens, and then the target was made with epoxy resin, After polishing, the internal structure of zircon was fully exposed, and then the images of cathodoluminescence (CL), backscatter (BSE), transmission light and reflection light were taken. The appropriate positions without cracks and inclusions were selected as far as possible, and the Neptune plus multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and resolution m-50 laser ablation system were used for testing, The zircon with harmonious U-Pb age was selected for testing, and the diameter of laser ablation spot was 45 μ m. The frequency is 6 Hz. The 176Lu / 177hf and 176hf / 177hf ratios of the zircons are calculated according to 176Lu / 175lu = 0.0265 and 176yb / 172yb = 0.5886, ε The decay constant of 176Lu is 1.867 × The present 176hf / 177hf of chondrite is 0.282772 and 176Lu / 177hf is 0.0332. The HF depleted mantle model age (tdm1) is calculated by 176hf / 177hf of present depleted mantle = 0.28325 and 176Lu / 177hf = 0.0384. The Hf isotope two-stage crustal model age (tdm2) is calculated by assuming 176Lu / 177hf of continental mean crust = 0.015.\nThis data can provide data support for geochemical model analysis of luokuidong molybdenum deposit in Hainan Island.\nThe above data are published in the core journal of geochemistry, the data are true and reliable, and the data are stored in the form of Excel.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of zircon analysis from molybdenum deposits, 'Hf isotopic data' refers to the measurements of hafnium isotopic ratios, specifically 176Lu/177Hf and 176Hf/177Hf, obtained from zircon crystals. These measurements are used to interpret geological processes such as crustal formation and evolution. The data are typically corrected using specific isotopic standards and are crucial for calculating parameters like εHf(t), TDM1, and TDM2, which provide insights into the age and source characteristics of the geological materials studied.",

                    "Answer": "The instrumental techniques include crushing whole rock samples to 40~60 mesh, followed by magnetic and heavy liquid separation. Zircon grains with good crystal form are handpicked and mounted in epoxy resin for polishing to expose internal structures. Cathodoluminescence (CL), back-scattered electron (BSE), transmitted light, and reflected light imaging are used to select suitable zircon positions without fractures or inclusions. Analysis is conducted using the Neptune Plus multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and RESOlution M-50 laser ablation system, focusing on zircons with concordant U-Pb ages. The laser ablation spot diameter is 45 μm with a frequency of 6 Hz. Zircon 176Lu/177Hf and 176Hf/177Hf ratios are corrected using standards and constants, such as 176Lu/175Lu=0.0265 and 176Yb/172Yb=0.5886, with further calculations for εHf(t), and Hf model ages (TDM1 and TDM2) using specific decay constants and isotopic ratios.",
