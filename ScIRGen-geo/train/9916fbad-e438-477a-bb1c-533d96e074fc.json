            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with ASTER was obtained in the saline plot B, the alfalfa plot D and the barley plot E of the Linze grassland foci experimental area on May 28, 2008. 49 points at intervals of 60m in each plot (360m×360m) were selected and observation items included:\n    (1) the land surface radiative temperature by the hand-held infrared thermometer from east to west in the saline plot B, the alfalfa plot D and the alfalfa plot E. Each point was numbered, such as D22-23, indicating from No. 22 to 23 in the alfalfa plot D. In the salineplot B, 5 measurements were carried out each 5m; in the alfalfa plot D and the barley plot E, measurements were at random. Calibration information was archived in the hand-held infrared thermometer calibration.xls.\n    (2) soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying measured by the cutting ring and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm measured by the probe thermometer in plot B; the soil temperature, soil moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity measured by the POGO soil sensor, and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm measured by the probe thermometer in plot D; soil moisture, soil conductivity, the soil temperature, and the real part of soil complex permittivity were measured by WET, and the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer in plot E.\n    Six Excel files on soil moisture and the land surface radiative temperature in plot B, D and E were archived. See WATER: Dataset of setting of the sampling plots and stripes in the foci experimental area of Linze station for more information.",

In contrast, soil moisture data collection involves different instruments for each sample plot: sample plot B uses the ring knife method for soil moisture and density, sample plot D uses a POGO portable soil sensor for various soil properties, and sample plot E uses a WET soil moisture rapid tester along with a needle thermometer for average soil temperature.",

For instance, in the remote sensing experiment, sample plot B uses a ring knife method to obtain soil moisture through drying, while plots D and E utilize portable soil sensors and soil moisture rapid measuring instruments, respectively. These varied methodologies, along with differences in sampling intervals and calibration techniques, such as the use of handheld infrared thermometers with specific calibration data, can lead to differences in measurement outcomes.",

These observations involve a linear measurement approach, moving from one sample point to another, with each point being 60 meters apart. For soil moisture, different instruments are used based on the sample plot: ring knives for soil samples in one plot, portable soil sensors like POGO for another, and WET soil moisture rapid measurement instruments for the third plot. Each method includes specific techniques such as drying soil samples for moisture content or measuring electrical conductivity and dielectric constants, along with using a needle thermometer for average soil temperature at 0-5 cm depth.",
