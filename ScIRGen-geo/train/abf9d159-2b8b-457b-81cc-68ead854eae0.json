Additionally, changes in the landscape, seasonal variations, and the inherent limitations in detecting ice-covered or shadowed areas can also contribute to measurement errors.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective is to systematically document and analyze the characteristics and changes of ice lakes across different regions of the Greater Himalaya, such as the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and various parts of the Himalayas, over a 30-year period. This includes understanding the lake areas, their types, elevation, perimeter, and any new formations, as well as assessing uncertainties in measurements. This information is crucial for monitoring glacial lake dynamics and potential impacts on local environments and communities.",

                    "Answer": "In the field of ice lake cataloging, manual delineation involves using satellite imagery such as Landsat data to outline the boundaries of ice lakes. This process includes selecting appropriate images based on specific metadata like Path, Row, and Date. The delineation is then checked and classified using tools like Google Earth to ensure accuracy. Key steps include selecting clear imagery, accurately drawing lake perimeters, and cross-referencing with other data sources to verify lake types and sizes. Optimizations can involve using automated tools to assist with initial outlines or employing machine learning techniques to differentiate lake types and minimize human error.",
