            "description": "This dataset contains the ground surface water (including liquid water, glacier and perennial snow) distribution in Qilian Mountain Area in 2018. The dataset was produced based on classical Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) extraction criterion and manual editing. Landsat images collected in 2018 were used as basic data for water index extraction. Sentinel-2 images and Google images were employed as reference data for adjusting the extraction threshold. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates and water area. Consisting of 1 season, the dataset has a temporal resolution of 1 year and a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±30 meter). The dataset directly reflects the distribution of water bodies within the Qilian Mountain in 2018, and can be used for quantitative estimation of water resource.",

The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method is applied to these images to initially extract water body distribution, which includes liquid water, glaciers, and perennial snow. This initial extraction is then manually corrected using reference data from Google imagery and Sentinel-2 imagery to ensure accuracy. The final product is stored in a shapefile format and includes attributes such as coordinate systems and water body areas.
