Due to the snow and cloud reflection characteristics, the use of optical remote sensing to monitor snow is severely disturbed by the weather. This product is based on the most commonly used cloud removal algorithm, using the MODIS daily snow product and passive microwave data AMSR-E snow water equivalent product, and the daily cloudless snow product in the Tibetan Plateau is developed.

With the rapid development of space and information technology, satellite remote sensing has gradually become an effective means of snow observation. The use of remote sensing technology for snow mapping and monitoring has a research history of over 40 years, and a series of snow mapping algorithms and products have been developed. Due to the reflective spectral characteristics of snow and clouds, monitoring snow using optical remote sensing data is greatly limited by weather conditions. In recent years, both domestically and internationally, a series of algorithms and patented products have been developed to eliminate cloud contamination in snow classification and fusion algorithms for MODIS and AMSR-E."

Observational results of snow depth from weather stations during the study period indicate that the snowfall during the snow season of 2010-2011 was uneven and relatively low, and there is a lack of snow observation data in high-altitude cold regions, which makes the accuracy validation of the synthesized daily snow products insufficiently comprehensive."

For the analysis of the daily synthesized snow product, if there are cloud pixels in the synthesized snow product for the day, and the pixels at the same location for the previous and following days are classified as snow, then the cloud pixels for that day are classified as snow. Using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM-DEM), the elevation of snow, land, and cloud pixels from the daily synthesized MODIS snow map is extracted. The SNOWL method is used for discriminative analysis and reclassification of cloud pixels. Based on the characteristic that microwave data is not affected by clouds, a comparative analysis can be conducted between the synthesized MODIS snow data and the daily snow water equivalent product from the passive microwave data AMSR-E in snow-covered areas."
