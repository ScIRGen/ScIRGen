            "description": "During the period of middle stream experiment in 2012, closed chamber and gas chromatography method was used to measure soil respiration of different land surface, including farmland, orchard, wetland, sparse grassland (Huazhaizi), Gobi, desert. \nInstrument: Assimilation Chamber\nMeasuring method: Assimilation chamber consists of two parts: the base and the box. Base made of PVC material, the bottom buried in the soil. The box is made of stainless steel cubes, with one open side. When measuring the box cover on the base, air in the box was sampled using injector. The extracted air was injected into the gas sampling bag, and shipped back to the laboratory analysis of the concentration of CO2 by gas chromatography in Institute of Botany, The Chinese Academy of Sciences. Using the difference of concentration of CO2 at two times to calculate soil respiration. Each measurement points are located three repeat. After five minutes sealed box cover start mining the 1st sample, and then taken once every sample interval of 10 minutes, four times in total mining.\nDate content: Data content includes header information and once every 10 days three times repeated observations and the average of the three times.\nMeasuring location: Gobi (Bajitan Gobi station), Wetland (Zhangye wetland Station), Sparse grassland (Huazhaizi desert steppe Station), Desert (Shenshawo sandy desert Station), Orchard (site No.17 eddy covariance system), Maize Farmland (Daman Superstation)\nMeasuring time: 16-6-2012, 28-6-2012, 9-7-2012, 18-7-2012, 30-7-2012, 11-8-2012, 21-8-2012, 2-9-2012, 13-9-2012, 22-9-2012 (UTC+8).",

Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."
