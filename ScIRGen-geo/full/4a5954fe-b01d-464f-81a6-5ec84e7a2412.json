            "description": "The dataset of the ground-based microwave radiometers and ground truth observations for soil freeze/thaw cycle was obtained in the A'rou foci experimental area (N38º03.639'/E100º26.793'; 2998m) from May 5 to 8, 2008, S-band from Apr. 6 to 8, C-band from Apr. 7 to 8, K-band from Apr. 5 to 8, and Ka-band on Apr. 5, to be specific. The aims of the measurements were the effects of the soil freeze/thaw status on the microwave brightness temperatures. \n     The observation site was bare land and the soil moisture was 30% after artificial irrigation. Observation items included the soil temperature at 5cm automatically (the time interval: 10m), the soil temperature at 5cm, 10cm, 20cm and 30cm by the probe thermometer (the time interval: 1h), and the soil moisture at 5cm, 10cm, 20cm and 30cm automatically (the time interval: 10m). \n     Seven files were included, four ground-based microwave radiometers (S-band, C-band, K-band and Ka-band) observations, the automatic soil temperature, the manual soil temperature, and the automatic soil moisture, and the last three were archived in Excel format.",
