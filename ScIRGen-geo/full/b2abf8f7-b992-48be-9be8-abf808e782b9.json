            "description": "The continuous advancement of SAR interferometry technology makes it possible to obtain multitemporal DEMs with high precision in the glacial area. In particular, in 2000, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) led by NASA provided DEM data covering the area from 56ºS to 60ºN; the TanDEM-X bistatic SAR interferometry system of DLR could provide the global DEM data with high resolution and precision. These high-quality, large-coverage SAR interferometry data, as well as published DEM data products, provided valuable information for using the multitemporal DEMs to detect changes in ice thickness.\nThe temporal coverage of the ice thickness variation data of typical glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau was from 2000 to 2013, covering Puruogangri and the west Qilian Mountains with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. Using TanDEM-X bistatic InSAR data and a C-band SRTM DEM, the differential radar interferometry method was first used to generate a TanDEM-X DEM with high precision. Then, based on the precise registration of DEM, the DEM data obtained in different periods were compared. Lastly, the ice thickness changes were estimated. The format of the data set was GeoTIFF, and each typical glacier ice thickness change was stored in a folder.\nFor details of the data, please refer to the Ice elevation changes for typical glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau - Data Description.",

However, it is difficult for these LiDAR systems to acquire topographic datasets over large-scale glaciated regions, because of political sensitivities (e.g., Karakoram), high costs, and poor archiving. However, this repeat-pass InSAR is still challenging for glacier applications because it commonly suffers from atmospheric disturbance (mainly due to variations of the troposphere and the ionosphere between the repeat-pass SAR acquisitions), as well as temporal decorrelation induced by ice melting, snow accumulation and glacier movement between acquisitions."
