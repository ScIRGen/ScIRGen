            "description": "The data are AMS data of PENGGUAN complex. We used a portable gasoline rig to drill 5-7 cores at each sampling point, with an interval of 1 m to 2 m, and each core is about 3-6 cm long. Each core pillar was oriented by magnetic compass and solar compass, and magnetic declination (7 °) Correction of the error. In order to avoid the interference of core geometry on magnetic fabric, each core column is cut into a standard column with a diameter of 2.5 cm and a length of 2.2 cm. The AMS tests were carried out in the agico kappabridge (mfk1) low field condition of paleomagnetism laboratory, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The statistical analysis of AMS is mainly completed with the help of anisoft 4.2. The data has been officially published in tectonics, and the quality is true and reliable.",

                    "Answer": "Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) in the context of geological datasets refers to the variation in magnetic susceptibility of rock samples in different directions. This variation is used to infer the rock fabric and deformation history. In this field, AMS data is collected by drilling rock cores at specific intervals, orienting them with magnetic and solar compasses, and analyzing them under low-field conditions using specialized equipment like the AGICO Kappabridge. This data is statistically analyzed to understand the magnetic fabric, which can provide insights into geological processes.",

By analyzing the AMS, researchers may infer the orientations of magnetic minerals, which can suggest the directions of past tectonic stresses and deformation events. The consistency in AMS patterns across multiple samples and locations could indicate widespread tectonic activities, while variations might point to localized events or heterogeneous stress fields. Additionally, the correction for magnetic declination and the standardization of sample preparation ensure that the data accurately reflect the geological processes, minimizing the influence of external factors on the magnetic fabric of the rocks.",

                    "Answer": "The variations in AMS data collection techniques can be influenced by the use of portable gasoline drills to obtain rock cores at sampling points with specific spacing and core length. The orientation of each core using magnetic and solar compasses, correction for magnetic declination, and the cutting of cores into standardized cylindrical forms are factors contributing to the data collection process. Additionally, the use of low-field conditions for AMS testing and statistical analysis using specialized software like ANISOFT 4.2 can affect variations in the data collected.",

This data can help in reconstructing past tectonic environments and contribute to a deeper understanding of geological formations in the area.",
