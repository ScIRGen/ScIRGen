            "description": "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period of time, which has been used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region. According to the collected the published global GDP data of 2015, a downscaling model, named support vector machine regression kriging was established for predicting 100-m GDP in thirty-four key nodes along the Belt and Road. The remote sensed night light data, land cover, vegetation and terrain indices were employed as ancillary variables in downscaling process. To solve the problem of missing data existing in the ancillary datasets, we will apply kriging and function interpolation methods to fill gaps. The aggregation and resampling were used to obtain 1-km and 500-m all ancillary variables, as well as 100-m terrain indices including elevation, slope and aspect. The adopted downscaling model contains trend and residual predictions. The support vector machine regression is used to model the relationship among GDP and its ancillary variables for obtaining GDP trends at fine scale based on scale invariant of the relationship. And then, the kriging interpolation is used to estimate GDP residuals at fine scale. In the downscaling process, the mentioned downscaling model was firstly employed in 1-km and 500-m data for obtaining 500-m GDP predictions; and it was again used in 500-m and 100-m data for achieving 100-m GDP predictions. The 100-m GDP predictions in constant 2011 international US dollars would provide high spatial resolution data for risk assessments.",

We first expanded the rasterized national and sub-national boundaries to cover NoData areas (such as sea areas and other water bodies) with a 2 arc-degree buffer, using the Euclidean Allocation tool in ArcMap 9.2. Next, we created a land mask by combining cells from both population datasets used, and national boundary data. This land mask was then used to set non-land cells to NoData. To compile the GDP per capita (PPP) dataset (Data Citation 1), we first put together a full national GDP dataset, drawn from the most recent World Bank Development Indicators database 32. For missing countries (see Supplementary Information), we used data from the CIA’s World Factbook 33, except for one administrative unit, namely French Southern Territories, for which no data was found and regional average data was used (see below). The constant 2015 international US dollars of CIA fact sheets were converted to constant 2011 international US dollars, the unit in which national GDP from World Bank was given. For that we used the standard method documented by the World Bank39. Temporal interpolation followed the same method as for national values. The data were extrapolated over time by scaling the last available value to reflect subsequent national changes, and similarly scaling the first value with preceding changes. After deriving both national and sub-national tabulated data, we first created a raster dataset of these two spatial scales for each time step, and then combined the two raster datasets, which resulted in the final GDP per capita (PPP) raster dataset provided here. To estimate the total GDP (PPP) of each grid cell, we multiplied the GDP per capita (PPP) by grid specific population data using two different spatial resolutions: 5 arc-min (10 km at equator) (Data Citation 1) and 30 arc-sec (1 km at equator) (Data Citation 1). To compile the HDI dataset (Data Citation 1), we first produced a full national HDI dataset, based on the data from the Human Development Reports by UNDP 30 (Table 3). After deriving both national and sub-national tabulated data, we first created raster datasets of these two scales for each time step, and then combined the two rasters, resulting in the final HDI raster dataset provided here. To estimate the error originating from the interpolation and extrapolation to fill the missing data entries, we performed an error analysis separately for national and sub-national level data."

                    "Answer": "The creation of a seamless administrative raster file is enabled by using national and sub-national boundaries along with population datasets. The process involves expanding rasterized boundaries to cover NoData areas, using tools like the Euclidean Allocation tool in ArcMap, and combining cells from different datasets to create a land mask that sets non-land cells to NoData.",

These auxiliary variables provide crucial insights into human activities and environmental conditions, which can enhance the accuracy of GDP predictions when used in a sophisticated model like the support vector machine regression kriging downscaling model.

These models can capture complex, non-linear relationships between GDP and various auxiliary data, providing more accurate and nuanced predictions. By leveraging fine-scale input variables, machine learning approaches can refine the spatial resolution of economic data, which is vital for detailed risk evaluations. However, the success of these models depends on the availability of high-quality training data and the appropriateness of the model parameters for the specific economic context being analyzed.",

This model establishes a nonlinear relationship between kilometer-scale GDP and these variables, predicting GDP trends at finer scales by assuming the scale-invariance of variable relationships. Kriging interpolation is then used to predict GDP residuals at fine scales.",

                    "Answer": "The process begins by using 1-km and 500-m data to predict GDP at 500-m resolution via the downscaling model. Subsequently, 500-m and 100-m data are used to refine the prediction and achieve the final 100-m resolution GDP grid for the specified key regions. This staged approach leverages data aggregation and resampling methods to enhance spatial resolution incrementally.",

A support vector machine regression kriging downscaling model is constructed to achieve GDP prediction at 100-meter spatial resolution for key node regions. This model includes both trend and residual predictions, where the trend prediction relies on the non-linear relationship between kilometer-scale GDP and auxiliary variables. The residual prediction is obtained using kriging interpolation. Auxiliary data gaps are filled using kriging interpolation, and data aggregation and resampling methods are employed to derive necessary data at various resolutions, such as 1-km and 500-m night-time light, vegetation index, land cover data, and terrain indices.",

The methodology involves creating a seamless administrative raster file using national and sub-national boundaries, combined with population datasets. Temporal interpolation and extrapolation are employed to scale data to reflect national changes, ensuring comprehensive coverage. This approach allows for the creation of gridded datasets with varying resolutions, such as 5 arc-min and 30 arc-sec, by multiplying GDP per capita by grid-specific population data.",
