            "description": "This data set is the data set of human activities in key areas of Qilian Mountains in 2021, with a spatial resolution of 2m. This data set focuses on the monitoring of mining, urban expansion, cultivated land development, hydropower construction and tourism development in key areas of Qilian Mountains. Through high-resolution remote sensing images, the changes before and after statistics are compared. The map spots of land type change in Qilian mountain area were investigated and verified block by block; Reinterpret and verify the plots with suspicious mapping; For the land type that cannot be reflected by the image, verify the land type on the spot, collect relevant data, check and correct the position. At the same time, further check the attribute information of the monitoring content of key areas in the Qilian Mountains in 2021, input and edit the map spots and their attributes in a unified way, form a human activity data set in the Qilian Mountains in 2021, realize the current situation and timeliness of ecological governance in the Qilian Mountains, and provide data support for human activity monitoring in key areas in the Qilian Mountains.",
