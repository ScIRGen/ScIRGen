            "description": "The dataset of vegetation cover fraction observations was obtained by the self-made instrument and the camera at a height of 2.5m-3.5m above the ground in the Yingke oasis, Huazhaizi desert steppe and Biandukou foci experimental areas on May 20, 24, 25, 28 and 30, Jun. 11, 14, 15, 21, 23, 24, 27 and 30, and Jul. 2, 2008.    \n     Observations were carried out in Yingke oasis maize field, Yingke oasis wheat field, Huazhaizi desert No. 1 and 2 plots, the rape field, the barley field and grassland in Biandukou.\n     A pole with known length was put in each photo to determine the size of the photo. GPS data was used for the location and the technology LAB was used to retieve the coverage of the green vegetation. Besides, surrounding environment was also recorded.\nThe dataset included the primary collected vegetation images and retrieved fraction of vegetation coverage.",

This involves taking ground photos with a camera positioned 2.5m to 3.5m above the ground, using known objects for scale, and determining the location with GPS. This method is potentially more efficient than traditional manual surveying as it allows batch processing of images and uses color space transformation for precise vegetation detection. However, its accuracy would depend on the quality of images and the effectiveness of the LAB transformation, which might need comparison with other spectral or manual methods to evaluate efficiency and precision.",

Additionally, extracting green vegetation coverage using LAB color space transformation may encounter difficulties due to the varying lighting conditions and the presence of non-vegetative green objects.",

                    "Answer": "To measure and verify vegetation coverage in arid environments, a custom-made coverage observation instrument is utilized. A camera is positioned at a height of 2.5m to 3.5m from the ground to capture images of the surface. Known-length objects such as measuring tapes or bamboo poles are placed within the photo's frame to calibrate the area size. GPS is used to determine the location of the photo, and information related to coverage and the shooting environment is recorded. The LAB color space transformation technique is employed to extract green vegetation coverage from the images.",
