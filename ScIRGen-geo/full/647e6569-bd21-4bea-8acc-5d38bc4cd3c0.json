            "description": "CMADS V1.1(The China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the SWAT model Version 1.1) Version of the data set introduced the STMAS assimilation algorithm. It was constructed using multiple technologies and scientific methods, including loop nesting of data, projection of resampling models, and bilinear interpolation. The CMADS series of datasets can be used to drive various hydrological models, such as SWAT, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and the Storm Water Management model (SWMM). It also allows users to conveniently extract a wide range of meteorological elements for detailed climatic analyses. Data sources for the CMADS series include nearly 40,000 regional automatic stations under China’s 2,421 national automatic and business assessment centres. This ensures that the CMADS datasets have wide applicability within the country, and that data accuracy was vastly improved.\nThe CMADS series of datasets has undergone finishing and correction to match the specific format of input and driving data of SWAT models. This reduces the volume of complex work that model builders have to deal with. An index table of the various elements encompassing all of East Asia was also established for SWAT models. This allows the models to utilize the datasets directly, thus eliminating the need for any format conversion or calculations using weather generators. Consequently, significant improvements to the modelling speed and output accuracy of SWAT models were achieved.\nMost of the source data in the CMADS datasets are derived from CLDAS in China and other reanalysis data in the world. The integration of air temperature (2m), air pressure, humidity, and wind speed data (10m) was mainly achieved through the LAPS/STMAS system. Precipitation data were stitched using CMORPH’s global precipitation products and the National Meteorological Information Center’s data of China (which is based on CMORPH’s integrated precipitation products). The latter contains daily precipitation records observed at 2,400 national meteorological stations and the CMORPH satellite’s inversion precipitation products.The inversion algorithm for incoming solar radiation at the ground surface makes use of the discrete longitudinal method by Stamnes et al.(1988)to calculate radiation transmission. The resolutions for CMADS V1.0, V1.1, V1.2, and V1.3 were 1/3°, 1/4°, 1/8°, and 1/16°, respectively.\nIn CMADS V1.0 (at a spatial resolution of 1/3°), East Asia was spatially divided into 195 × 300 grid points containing 58,500 stations. Despite being at the same spatial resolution as CMADS V1.0, CMADS V1.1 contains more data, with 260 × 400 grid points containing 104,000 stations. For both versions, the stations’ daily data include average solar radiation, average temperature (2m), average pressure, maximum and minimum temperature (2m), specific humidity, cumulative precipitation, and average wind speed (10m).\nThe CMADS comprises other variables for any hydrological model(under 'For-other-model' folder): Daily Average Temperature (2m), Daily Maximum Temperature (2m), Daily Minimum Temperature (2m), Daily cumulative precipitation (20-20h), Daily average Relative Humidity, Daily average Specific Humidity, Daily average Solar Radiation, Daily average Wind (10m), and Daily average Atmospheric Pressure.\nIntroduction to metadata of CMADS\nCMADS storage path description:(CMADS was divided into two datesets)\n1.CMADS-V1.0 For-swat  --specifically driving the SWAT model\n2.CMADS-V1.0 For-other-model  --specifically driving the other hydrological model(VIC,SWMM,etc.)\nCMADS-- For-swat-2009  folder contain:(Station  and Fork )\n1).Station \nRelative-Humidity-58500  Daily average relative humidity(fraction)\nPrecipitation-58500  Daily accumulated 24-hour precipitation(mm)\nSolar radiation-58500  Daily average solar radiation(MJ/m2)\nTmperature-58500  Daily maximum and minimum 2m temperature(℃) \nWind-58500  Daily average 10m wind speed(m/s)\nWhere R, P, S, T, W+ dimensional grid number - the number of longitude grid is the station in the above five\nfolders respectively.(Where R,P,S,T,W respective Daily average relative humidity,Daily cumulative\nprecipitation(24h),Daily mean solar radiation(MJ/m2),Daily maximum and minimum temperature(℃) and Daily mean\nwind speed (m/s)) respectively.Data format is (.dbf)\n2).Fork  (Station index table over East Asia)\nPCPFORK.txt (Precipitation index table)\nRHFORK.txt (Relative humidity index table)\nSORFORK.txt (Solar radiation index table)\nTMPFORK.txt (Temperature index table)\nWINDFORK.txt (Wind speed index)\nCMADS-- For-swat-2012  folder contain:(Station  and Fork ) Storage structure is consistency with  For-swat-\n2009 .However, all the data in this directory are only available in TXT format and can be readed by SWAT2012.\n3) For-other-model  (Includes all weather input data required by the any hydrologic model (daily).)\nAtmospheric-Pressure-txt  Daily average atmospheric pressure(hPa)\nAverage-Temperature-txt  Daily average 2m temperature(℃)\nMaximum-Temperature-txt  Daily maximum 2m temperature(℃)\nMinimum-Temperature-txt  Daily minimum 2m temperature(℃)\nPrecipitation-txt  Daily accumulated 24-hour precipitation (mm)\nRelative-Humidity-txt  Daily average relative humidity(fraction)\nSolar-Radiation-txt  Daily average solar radiation(MJ/m2)\nSpecific-Humidity-txt  Daily average Specific Humidity(g/kg)\nWind-txt  Daily average 10m wind speed(m/s)\nData storage information: data set storage format is .dbf and .txt\nOther data information:\nTotal data:45GB\nOccupied space: 50GB\nTime: From year 2008 to year 2014\nTime resolution: Daily\nGeographical scope description: East Asia\nLongitude: 60° E\nThe most east longitude: 160°E\nNorth latitude: 65°N\nMost southern latitude: 0°N\nNumber of stations: 58500 stations\nSpatial resolution: 1/3 * 1/3 * grid points\nVertical range: None",

The CLM model is considered one of the most comprehensive and reliable land surface models internationally. Soil temperature is crucial in land surface process research because it affects the surface water and energy balance, providing feedback to the climate and serving as an important factor in soil moisture status and thermal properties. Recent research has shown that soil temperature can significantly impact meteorological research and forecasting models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational forecast models, affecting short-term precipitation simulation results."
