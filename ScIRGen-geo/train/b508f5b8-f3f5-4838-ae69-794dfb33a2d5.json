            "description": "Landslide drainage and seepage prevention is a common technology for the treatment of landslide source area in Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The calculation of the existing siphon drainage velocity formula is improved, and the correctness of the modified velocity formula is verified by experiments. The test results show that: (1) the existing siphon calculation formula is only suitable for the calculation of low lift siphon drainage velocity, and the calculation error of high lift siphon drainage velocity is large, and the maximum relative error is more than 90%; (2) The modified siphon calculation formula is suitable for siphon drainage systems with various heads. The theoretical calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental results, and the relative general error of theoretical calculation is less than 20%; (3) Therefore, it is recommended to use the proposed modified formula for the calculation of siphon drainage velocity.",

This involves measuring how fast water is removed through siphons, which is crucial for evaluating and improving drainage techniques to prevent water accumulation and potential landslides in this region.",

                    "Answer": "The significant errors in existing siphon drainage flow rate calculation formulas for high-lift siphon systems are caused by their limitation to low-lift scenarios. These formulas have a relative error that can exceed 90% for high-lift systems. The errors can be addressed by modifying the siphon flow rate calculation formulas to ensure accuracy across various lift scenarios. Experimentation and data collection to test and validate these modified formulas are crucial in ensuring their accuracy, as evidenced by the improved performance where the relative error is reduced to within 20%.",

                    "Answer": "The modification of existing siphon formulas for different lift heights significantly improves the accuracy of drainage flow rate calculations. The existing formulas are only accurate for low-lift siphon drainage systems and can have a relative error exceeding 90% for high-lift systems. The corrected formula, however, is applicable to all lift heights and aligns well with experimental results, reducing the relative error of theoretical calculations to within 20%.",
