            "description": "Based on literature collection and database integration methods, the forest structure-forest age dataset was constructed on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. This dataset includes elements such as forest age, aboveground/belowground biomass, geographic location, and forest type. The compilation of this dataset helps to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship and distribution characteristics between forest biomass and forest age in the region. The data is sourced from 118 literature and 282 sample plots. After removing duplicates and outliers, they were classified into coniferous forests, broad-leaved forests, and mixed forests based on dominant species or vegetation types. After careful data integration and cleaning, the credibility and accuracy of the data are guaranteed, and the data quality is excellent. This dataset can provide basic data support for research on forest ecosystems in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, such as simulating carbon cycling processes in ecosystem models.",
