It is expressed in geographic coordinates using the decimal degree. The main contents include: marsh wetland types, wetland water supply types, soil types, main vegetation types, geographical area, etc. Implemented the \"Standard for Information Classification and Coding of Sustainable Development Information Sharing System of China\". Data source of this database: 1:20 swamp map (internal version), Tibetan Plateau 1: 500,000 swamp map (internal version), swamp survey data 1: 1 million and national 1: 4 million swamp map; processing steps are: data source selection, preprocessing, digitization and encoding of marsh wetland elements, data editing processing, establishing topological relationships, edge processing, projection conversion, linking with attribute databases such as place names and obtaining attribute data.",

                    "Answer": "The selection and pre-processing of specific geographical data sources for marsh wetlands are influenced by the need to accurately reflect swamp wetland information from the 2000s across China. This involves choosing data sources such as 1:20 marsh maps, 1:50,000 marsh maps of the Tibetan Plateau, 1:1,000,000 marsh survey data, and 1:4,000,000 national marsh maps. These sources are then pre-processed and digitized to capture marsh wetland elements, followed by editing, topological relationship establishment, edge matching, projection conversion, and linking with attribute databases to obtain comprehensive attribute data.",
