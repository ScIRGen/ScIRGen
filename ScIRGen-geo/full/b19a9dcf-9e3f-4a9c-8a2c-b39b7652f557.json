The quadrates were changed from 4×4 into 3×3 subsites during the foci experimental period, with each one spanning a 30×30 m2 plot. The centers and corners of each subsite were collected. As for the sampling lines, samples were collected every 100 m along them from south to north. The points were named in the form of L1-1, indication No. 1 point in No. 1 line.\n     The coordinates and elevation of each sampling point were included in the dataset in Excel format.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of data collection for spatial sampling in remote sensing experiments, 'Grid' refers to a unit of measurement used in the arrangement of sampling plots or transects. Each Grid is a square area, with dimensions of 30m x 30m, used to systematically organize and distribute sampling points. During the pre-experimental phase, the Grid arrangement consists of a 3x3 configuration, which is expanded to a 4x4 configuration during the intensive experimental phase. Sampling points are usually located at the corners and center of each Grid.",

                    "Answer": "In the Aru Dense Observation Area, the sample plots are organized in grids, initially set as 3Grid×3Grid and expanded to 4Grid×4Grid during the intensified experiment period, each grid being 30m×30m. Sampling points are positioned at each grid's corners and center. In contrast, the sample belts are oriented north-south with sampling points spaced at 100m intervals. This results in a denser spatial distribution and more localized sampling within the plots compared to the more linear and evenly spaced sampling along the belts.",

                    "Answer": "In the given field, the layout within a dense observation area involves placing sampling plots and belts, such as three plots (A1, A2, A3) and six belts (L1 to L6). Each plot initially uses a 3x3 grid during the pre-test phase, expanded to a 4x4 grid in the enhanced test phase, with each grid measuring 30m x 30m. Sampling points are typically located at the corners and center of each grid. Each belt is oriented north-south with sampling points spaced 100m apart. The naming convention for sampling points is based on the plot or belt and point number, such as A1-1 for the first point in plot A1. This information is captured and stored in Excel format, detailing the latitude, longitude, and elevation of each sampling point.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection techniques involve placing sampling points within a grid system during pre-experiment and enhanced experiment periods, ensuring precise positioning by using a structured layout where each Grid is 30m x 30m, with sampling points located at the corners and center. The coordinates and elevations of these points are then recorded and stored in an Excel spreadsheet.",

Sampling points are strategically located at the corners and center of each grid. Additionally, transects are oriented north-south with sampling points spaced 100m apart, which ensures systematic coverage. This method allows for high-resolution data collection and can be further refined by increasing grid density or varying the orientation of transects to capture different environmental gradients.",
