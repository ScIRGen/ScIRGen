Instruments for the oasis-desert system were arranged in hierarchically nested scales to capture multi-scale eco-hydrological processes. We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale. A total of 12 airborne remote sensing missions were conducted to cover the FEA using LiDAR, an imaging spectrometer, a multi-angle thermal imager, and an L-band microwave radiometer."

        "AnswerEn": "The data collection techniques for measuring channel flow rates involve using portable mechanical flowmeters like the Flowatch, which measure fluid velocity based on the rotation speed of a water wheel. It has a flow velocity observation accuracy of 0.1 m/s. The methodology involves observing the flow velocity at 0.6 times the channel's center water level, and using the channel's cross-sectional area and water level to calculate flow rates.",

        "AnswerEn": "One of the main challenges in collecting multiscale eco-hydrological data is the lack of availability of multiscale observations. To address this challenge, experiments like HiWATER have been designed to provide multiscale and multidisciplinary data using hierarchically nested instrumentation. This includes flux observation matrices, eco-hydrological sensor networks, and hyper-resolution airborne remote sensing, which are all integrated to capture diverse eco-hydrological processes effectively.",
        "AnswerCn": "收集多尺度生态水文数据的主要挑战之一是缺乏多尺度观测的可用性。为了解决这一挑战，像HiWATER这样的实验被设计用来提供多尺度和多学科的数据，采用分层嵌套的仪器。这包括通量观测矩阵、生态水文传感器网络和超高分辨率的空中遥感，这些都被整合在一起，以有效捕捉多样的生态水文过程。",
