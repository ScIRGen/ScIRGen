            "description": "(Please notice that we have updated the data (V2.0) in May 2023 to extend the data period as well as gap-filled the vacant period between Oct 2011-June 2012 for the original V1.0  dataset. The V2.0 product has the same estimation error to the V1.0 one. Both versions are equally trusty for their accuracy. For details, please see the attached file \"2023-05-Instruction on update of the data.pdf\".) Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a crucial parameter for understanding the hydrological process of our earth surface. Passive microwave (PM) technique has long been the primary choice for estimating SSM at satellite remote sensing scales, while on the other hand, the coarse resolution (usually >~10 km) of PM observations hampers its applications at finer scales. Although quantitative studies have been proposed for downscaling satellite PM-based SSM, very few products have been available to public that meet the qualification of 1-km resolution and daily revisit cycles under all-weather conditions. In this study, therefore, we have developed one such SSM product in China with all these characteristics.  The product was generated through downscaling of AMSR-E and AMSR-2 based SSM at 36-km, covering all on-orbit time of the two radiometers during 2003-2019. MODIS optical reflectance data and daily thermal infrared land surface temperature (LST) that have been gap-filled for cloudy conditions were the primary data inputs of the downscaling model, in order to achieve the “all-weather” quality for the SSM downscaling outcome. Daily images from this developed SSM product have achieved quasi-complete coverage over the country during April-September. For other months, the national coverage percentage of the developed product is also greatly improved against the original daily PM observations.  We evaluated the product against in situ soil moisture measurements from over 2000 professional meteorological and soil moisture observation stations, and found the accuracy of the product is stable for all weathers from clear sky to cloudy conditions, with station averages of the unbiased RMSE ranging from 0.053 cm3/cm3 to 0.056 cm3/cm3. Moreover, the evaluation results also show that the developed product distinctly outperforms the widely known SMAP-Sentinel (Active-Passive microwave) combined SSM product at 1-km resolution. This indicates potential important benefits that can be brought by our developed product, on improvement of futural investigations related to hydrological processes, agricultural industry, water resource and environment management.\n\n",
            "instructions": "The surface soil moisture data is stored in HDF5. The file name is \"sm_yyyyddd. H5\", where yyyy represents the year and DDD represents Julian date, such as SM_ 2005001.h5 represents the surface soil moisture status in China at about 1:30 A.M. on the first day of 2005. Howeve, all data are stored using Int16 datatypes to save space. In this way, all data saved should be multiplied with 0,001 to obtain the real volumetric soil moisture content. For example, if the value retrieved from this product at one pixel of a day is 327, the corresponding soil moisture content is 0.327 cm3/cm3.",
