            "description": "The dataset of airborne WiDAS mission was obtained in the Linze station-Linze grassland flight zone on Jun. 29, 2008.\n     Data available for general users include Level-2C data (after geometric, radiometric and atmospheric corrections), Level-1B browse image (after intra-band matchingintra-band) and Level-2B browse image (intra-bandafter registration). The raw data, Level-1A, and data processing parameters were filed; applications would be evaluated prior to access. Data processing started in Aug. 2008 and ended in Apr. 2009, and in Nov. 2009, CCD data were reprocessed to adjust radiometric calibration. \n     The flying time of each route was as follows:\n\n{|\n! id \n! flight\n! relative height\n! starttime\n! endtime\n! data size\n! data state\n! data quality\n! ground targets \n|-\n| 1 || 1#13 || 1500m || 11:44:35 || 11:50:31 ||  90 || processed;complete || good || Pingchuan reservoir \n|-\n| 2 || 1#11 || 1500m || 11:55:55 || 12:01:55 || 91 || processed;complete || good || Linze grass station \n|-\n| 3 || 1#9_1 || 1500m || 12:06:27 || 12:12:27 || 91 || incomplete || incomplete || Pingchuan reservoir \n|-\n| 4 || 1#9_2 || 1500m || 13:01:35 || 13:07:43 || 93 || processed;complete || good || Pingchuan reservoir \n|-\n| 5 || 1#7 || 1500m || 12:17:59 || 12:23:59 || 91 || processed;complete || good || desert transit plot \n|-\n| 6 || 1#5 || 1500m || 12:28:35 || 12:34:31 || 　90 || processed;complete || good || North-south desert strip \n|-\n| 7 || 1#3 || 1500m || 12:39:11 || 12:45:03 || 　89 || processed;complete || good || Pingchuan reservoir \n|-\n| 8 || 1#1 || 1500m || 12:50:55 || 12:56:51 || 90 || processed;complete || good || Linze station\n|}",
