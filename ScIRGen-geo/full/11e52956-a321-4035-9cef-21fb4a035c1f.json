            "description": "The dataset of airborne microwave radiometers (L&K) mission was obtained in the A'rou-Biandukou flight zone on Mar. 19, 2008.\n     The frequency of L bands was 1.4 GHz with back sight of 35 degree and dual polarization (H&V) was acquired; and the frequency of K band was 18.7 GHz at the nadir view angle without polarization. The plane took off at Zhangye airport at 9:25 (BJT) and landed at 12:50 along the scheduled lines at the altitude about 4100m and speed about 260km/hr. \n     The raw data include microwave radiometer (L&K bands) data and GPS data; the former are instantaneous non-imaging observation recorded in text, which will be converted into brightness temperatures according to the calibration coefficients (filed with raw data together), and the latter are aircraft longitude, latitude and attitude. Moreover, based on the respective real-time clock log, observations by the microwave radiometer and GPS can be integrated to offer coordinates matching for the former. Yaw, flip, and pitch motions of aircraft were ignored due to the low resolution of microwave radiometer observations. Observation information can also be rasterized, as required, after calibration and coordinates matching. L&K bands resolution (x) and footprint can be approximately estimated as x=0.3H (H is relative flight height) for L band and x=0.24H for K band.",

These coefficients are essential to ensure that the recorded data accurately reflect the physical properties being measured. The calibration process is necessary to account for the characteristics of the radiometer and the specific conditions during data collection, such as flight altitude and aircraft speed.",

This integration helps in mapping the microwave observations to the Earth's surface more accurately despite the coarse resolution of the radiometer data, ensuring that the data products are more reliable for users.",

The goals associated with collecting such data include obtaining precise measurements of brightness temperatures, which help in understanding surface conditions and atmospheric parameters. These observations are particularly useful for studying snow and ice cover, as demonstrated in the flight over the frozen Shuangsushi reservoir. By collecting this data, researchers aim to enhance the accuracy of geographical and environmental models, and improve the understanding of microwave interactions with natural surfaces at different frequencies and polarizations.",

                    "Answer": "The procedural steps in converting raw microwave radiometer data into usable brightness temperature values and georeferenced products involve several stages. First, the digital values obtained from the microwave radiometer's instantaneous observations need to be converted into brightness temperature values using calibration coefficients, which are archived along with the raw observation data. Next, the recorded microwave observations are matched with GPS data using their respective timestamps to assign geographic coordinates to the microwave observations. The data processing generally overlooks effects such as aircraft yaw, roll, and pitch due to the coarse resolution of the observations. Finally, after calibration and coordinate matching, the observational data can be rasterized, where the resolution and footprint for L and K bands are considered to be consistent with specific reference resolutions: for L band, the resolution is 0.3 times the relative flight altitude (H), and for K band, it is 0.24 times H. This results in a product that is ready for direct use by the end-user.",
