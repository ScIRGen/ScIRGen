In this project, an observation field was set up in Populus euphratica forest near the Alxa Desert eco hydrological experimental research station from 2011 to 2013 By manually measuring the groundwater depth every month in the year, it can provide basic data support for the study on the transpiration water consumption mechanism of Populus euphratica, and also can be used for the estimation of ecological water demand in the study area.",
