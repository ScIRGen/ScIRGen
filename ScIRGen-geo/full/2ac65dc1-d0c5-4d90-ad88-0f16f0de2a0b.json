The time resolution of the original data is 10min, the air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and air pressure are calculated by arithmetic mean, and the precipitation is the daily cumulative value. The meteorological station was set up at the end of 2006 and the probes were replaced in August 2020. Please note that the models of instrument probes before and after the update are as follows: the model of temperature and humidity probe was changed from HMP45C to hmp155; The model of air pressure probe is changed from PTB220 to ptb110; The model of wind speed sensor is changed from 034b to 0513, and the model of rain gauge sensor is rg13h\nThe data can be used by students and researchers engaged in meteorology, atmospheric environment or ecology (Note: when using, it must be indicated in the article that the data comes from South East Tibetan Plateau station for integrated observation and research of alpine environment, CAS)",

                "In mountainous areas, different altitudes exhibit distinct vertical zonation due to variations in water (precipitation) and heat (temperature) components. The southeastern Tibet Sejila Mountain has a pronounced mountain vertical zonation characteristic: from the foot of the mountain to the summit, it includes broadleaf forest, mixed coniferous and broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, shrubs, and moss. The vegetation types in Sejila Mountain are rich, and the longevity of trees is notable (Lu et al., 2015). The tree line at 4390 m is one of the highest forest lines in the world, making it a hotspot for tree-ring and forest ecology research (Wang et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018). Currently, there is limited research on the vertical gradients of temperature and precipitation in Sejila Mountain (Liang et al., 2011). Most studies by some scholars on the changes in temperature and precipitation vertical gradients in this region and its vicinity are based on the Baji Station (formerly Linzhi Station) and the nearby Bomi Station, focusing on the vertical lapse rate of temperature across the entire Tibetan Plateau (Jiang Jingchao et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2001, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) and precipitation gradients (Guo et al., 2016)."

Additionally, it provides reliable data support for future hydrological modeling in this region."

However, it may overlook short-term variations and extreme events, which could be significant in understanding local climate dynamics and variability. The choice of averaging method should be carefully considered based on the research objectives and the nature of the data.",

These factors can introduce uncertainties in the gradient estimations, and the presence of diverse environmental conditions across slopes could further complicate the analysis.",

Additionally, integrating remote sensing technologies and deploying advanced sensors could enhance data resolution and accuracy. Collaborative efforts with local agencies and leveraging historical data might also improve the foundational dataset for hydrological modeling.",

In the field, meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and pressure are collected using specialized sensors. These sensors are often placed in strategic locations to capture accurate readings, and the data is averaged or accumulated over specific intervals to ensure reliability. However, factors like the location of stations (e.g., ridge versus valley) and sensor calibration (e.g., changing sensor models) can impact data accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "In mountainous environments, the vertical temperature lapse rate is influenced by several factors, including altitude, slope orientation, and atmospheric conditions. For instance, in the South-East Tibetan plateau, different slopes (west and east) exhibit varying temperature lapse rates due to differences in solar radiation exposure and atmospheric circulation patterns. The altitude of measurement stations and their specific location (e.g., ridge or valley) also play crucial roles in determining the temperature lapse rate observed.",

                    "Answer": "Researchers often face challenges due to the limited number of high-altitude weather stations, which can affect the accuracy of precipitation gradient studies. To overcome this, they utilize data from multiple stations across varying altitudes and orientations to perform regression analysis, which helps estimate the precipitation gradients. Additionally, integrating data from other accessible nearby stations and considering natural geographic units (e.g., different slopes) can provide a more comprehensive understanding, despite the limited number of high-altitude observations.",
