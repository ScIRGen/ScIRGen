This dataset is based on the future monthly precipitation (PRE) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) dataset of 1km in China (published by this station) and obtained by annual PET/ annual PRE. The data adopts the latest SSP scenarios (ssp119, ssp126, ssp245, ssp585) released by IPCC. Each scenario contains the climate data of one GCM (mri-esm2-0). The data are single format and stored in NC (NetCDF) files. NC data can be opened by ArcMap software and extracted and processed by MATLAB and R software. The data suggest using WGS84 coordinate system. AI is an indicator to characterize the degree of dryness and wetness of a region. Generally, according to AI classification, the region can be broadly divided into humid (AI<1, equivalent to forest), semi-humid (AI in 1-1.5, equivalent to forest grassland), semi-arid (AI in 1.5-4, equivalent to dry grassland) and arid (AI≥4, equivalent to desert).",

                "Global warming has become an indisputable fact and has large long-term effects on water resources, plant growth, crop yields, and economic behavior (Naumann et al., 2018). Its impacts on water resources are the most obvious and extensive, because it can directly and quickly increase surface evaporation (Cook et al., 2014). Potential evapotranspiration (PET), a crucial hydrological variable that can quantify the water loss of a region, could be used to calculate actual evapotranspiration (Aouissi et al., 2016), plan crop irrigation (Fan et al., 2018), project vegetation dynamics (Peng and Li, 2018), and could act as input for ecosystem or hydrological models (Odusanya et al., 2019). Numerous approaches have been employed to estimate PET, including Budyko (Budyko, 1974), Priestley–Taylor (Priestley and Taylor, 1972), Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985), and FAO Penman–Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) models. However, the Hargreaves model is more suitable than the FAO Penman–Monteith model for use in a drier climate and for longer time periods (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003; Odusanya et al., 2019). The Hargreaves model adopts monthly minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures (TMN, TMX, and TMP, respectively) to calculate PET and thus can better attribute long-term PET variations to changes of these temperature variables, which in turn would enhance our understanding of how global warming induces surface water loss. Currently, climate data used to calculate PET typically comes from either station observations (Ning et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2009) or proxy climate data (Cook et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2017). Although these data can produce reliable and long-term PET results, respectively, they cannot elucidate the detailed spatial patterns of PET because of poor weather station density and climatic proxy data spatial resolution (e.g., >50 km) (Gao et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2014). Several studies reported that the Delta downscaling method can be used to generate the high-spatial-resolution climate datasets (Brekke et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2017; Wang and Chen, 2014). To date, many investigations regarding PET have been completed for China. However, these studies were conducted using datasets based on low-density weather stations with short time series (Chang et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019) or climatic proxy data with low spatial resolution (Chai et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Limited knowledge on the detailed spatial patterns of PET over China impedes the development of sustainable strategies to adapt and mitigate the climatic warming of China."

Therefore, the Hargreaves model should be employed to investigate long-term PET changes and the attribution of such changes to a warmer climate. Current work studied the changes and attribution of long-term PET in China. Specifically, the Delta downscaling framework and Hargreaves model were employed to generate high-spatial-resolution temperature time series and calculate PET for China, respectively."

To evaluate the 0.5’ downscaled temperatures, this study employed mean absolute error (MAE), the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). To detect PET trends, the linear regression relationship between annual PET and time was established at each grid point over China. Following the Hargreaves model, PET is a function of Ra, TMP, TMX, and TMN, and can be expressed as a sensitivity of PET to an independent variable x was calculated from the derivative of PET with respect to x."

PET variations during the historic period were most sensitive to mean temperature (TMP), while in the future period it was more sensitive to maximum temperature (TMX), suggesting a change in the primary sensitivity factor due to global warming. Minimum temperature (TMN) made the largest contribution (45%) to PET variations during the historic period, while TMX had the largest contribution (36–40%) in the future period. Therefore, the primary contributing factor might transform from TMN to TMX under climate change.

Several recent studies have suggested that ongoing warming is accelerating evaporation and creating more spatiotemporal heterogeneity in precipitation than in the past. China is home to multiple climate zones that host important agricultural regions and other societally important activities that are likely to be affected by increased drought. Several indexes have been employed to investigate long-term drought, including the standardized precipitation index, the Palmer drought severity index, and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Unlike the standardized precipitation index, the SPEI considers changes in both the precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration induced by temperature. The SPEI also allows for multiple temporal scales, unlike the Palmer drought severity index."

We also found that, compared with the past (1901–2017), the climate in the future (2018–2100) will tend toward significant droughts, although both periods showed a high spatial heterogeneity across China. Moreover, the proportion of areas with significantly decreasing SPEI trends was far greater than the proportion of those with increasing trends in most cases, especially for northwestern and northern China.

Although meteorological observation networks are increasingly incorporating data from a greater number of weather stations and contributions from an increasing number of governments and researchers around the world, observation networks still suffer from low station density and spatial resolution, especially in mountainous areas, where the installation and maintenance of weather stations are challenging. Proxy monthly temperature (TMP) and precipitation (PRE) data products are released by several climate research organizations such as the general circulation models (GCMs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), and Willmott & Matsuura (W&M). Although CRU products offer the advantage of reflecting long-term climate effects, their low spatial resolution (30′, approximately 55 km) limits their ability to reflect the effects of complex topographies, land surface characteristics, and other processes on climate systems. China has a large area with abundant mountainous regions. As a result, even the establishment of additional weather stations has not fully satisfied the requirements for long-term, high-spatial-resolution climate data, especially at finer geographical scales and for mountainous areas. Furthermore, most weather stations in China were established after 1950, and thus long-term observational climate data are lacking."

                    "Answer": "Challenges include the low density of weather stations and the low spatial resolution of climatic proxy data, which hinder the elucidation of detailed spatial patterns of PET. Although reliable PET calculations can be achieved using models like Hargreaves, capturing the detailed spatial variability necessitates high-resolution datasets obtained through methods such as Delta downscaling.",

                    "Question": "Please identify potential datasets and their sources that could be leveraged for enhancing the spatial resolution of climate data in mountainous and diverse terrain regions.",
                    "Answer": "Potential datasets include those from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and WorldClim, which provide long-term climatic data with varying spatial resolutions. The CRU datasets offer 30' spatial resolution data, while WorldClim provides finer resolutions (e.g., 0.5'). These datasets can be used as references to downscale larger resolution datasets to achieve higher spatial resolution outputs, particularly for complex terrains.",
