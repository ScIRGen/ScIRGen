            "description": "The dataset is the Landsat enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products from 1970s to 2020 over the Tibetan Plateau。The dataset is producted based on Landsat surface reflectance dataset. It is calculated by the EVI equation which is added backgroud adjusted parameters C1 and C2, and atmospheric adjusted parameter L based on NDVI equation.And the corresponding production of quality identification documents (QA) is also generated to identify the cloud, ice and snow. Compared with NDVI, EVI has stronger ability to resist atmospheric interference and noise,so it is more suitable for weather conditions with high aerosol content and lush vegetation areas.",
            "instructions": "1) File name rules: the EVI result of each scense is stored in a floder including the EVI band, QA bands, metadata, and browser; the named rule of a folder is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-EVI\",for example, L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-EVI;the EVI is stored as GeoTIFF format and its named rule is presented as \"satellite- sensor-path-row-imaging date-LSR-BRDF-EVI.TIF\", for example, \"L5-TM-115-026-19840418-LSR-BRDF-EVI.TIF\". 2) How to use the dataset:the surface reflectance results can be opened by ArcGIS, envi, QGIS and so on, the surface reflectance results are multiplied 10000 to become16 bit integer from the original floating-point type in the range of 0 ~ 1 , so it needs to be mutiplied 0.0001 when used, and the background filling value is -9999, and the \"LZW\" lossless compression is carried out.",

                    "Answer": "Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in the context of remote sensing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau refers to a satellite-derived index that improves upon the traditional NDVI by incorporating background adjustment parameters (C1 and C2) and atmospheric correction parameter (L) to better account for atmospheric interference and noise. It provides more reliable vegetation monitoring in areas with high aerosol content and dense vegetation.",

                    "Answer": "Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is designed to be more effective than NDVI in accounting for atmospheric conditions and noise, which are particularly challenging in high-altitude regions like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The effectiveness of EVI calculations can be influenced by factors such as high aerosol content and dense vegetation, which EVI is better suited to handle due to its incorporation of background adjustment parameters and atmospheric correction parameters. Data processing methods can be tailored to these conditions to enhance accuracy and reliability by using quality assurance files to identify and mitigate the impacts of clouds and snow.",

                    "Question": "What factors lead to the decision to use EVI over NDVI for monitoring vegetation in regions with high aerosol content?",
                    "Answer": "EVI is favored over NDVI for monitoring vegetation in regions with high aerosol content due to its stronger resistance to atmospheric interference and noise. This makes it more suitable for areas with high aerosol levels and densely vegetated regions, where accurate vegetation indices are crucial.",

                    "Answer": "Using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) instead of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can lead to better resistance to atmospheric interference and noise, making it more suitable for conditions with high aerosol content and dense vegetation. This affects data collection methods by potentially requiring adjustments in the processing of satellite surface reflectance data to incorporate EVI's background adjustment and atmospheric correction parameters, thus improving data quality and applicability in these challenging environments.",

                    "Answer": "The computation of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau involves the use of Landsat satellite surface reflectance data. The process includes applying the EVI calculation formula, which introduces background adjustment parameters C1 and C2, and an atmospheric correction parameter L, to enhance atmospheric interference resistance. To ensure data quality, a quality assessment (QA) file is produced to identify clouds and snow/ice in the data.",
