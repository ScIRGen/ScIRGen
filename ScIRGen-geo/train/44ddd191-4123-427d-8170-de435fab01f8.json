                "Snow cover is closely bound up with our climate. On the one hand, owing to snow’s unique optical properties (high albedo) it can affect the surface radiation budget severely and thereby our climate systems significantly (Warren, 1982; Huang et al., 2019). Remote sensing is a widely used tool for monitoring snow cover extent (SCE) globally and regionally at various spatial and temporal resolutions (Konig et al., 2001; Dozier and Painter, 2004; Frei et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014) since the beginning of the satellite era in the 1960s. Although the time coverage is long, the NHSCE product has a low spatiotemporal resolution, hand-drawn snow line maps, and incomplete spatial coverage due to swath gaps or cloud obscuration, largely restricting its application in climate research. These SCE datasets have good quality with a high spatiotemporal resolution, but their short period is insufficient to create a climatological baseline of snow cover. Although the JASMES product presented a long time series and significantly enhanced spatial and temporal resolutions, several shortcomings have been found. These shortcomings limit its application in snow monitoring and climate studies in China. Thus, China still lacks a high-quality, long-term SCE product with complete spatial coverage for climate research."

Using the Landsat-5 TM maps for the true values, we trained the frequency distribution characteristics of BT37-BT11 for cloud and snow samples from AVHRR SR. For daily AVHRR preliminary SCE records, gaps caused by frequent cloud obscuration or swath gaps remained serious. Two gap-filling strategies described below were used to generate a spatially complete daily AVHRR SCE record. To test the effect of HMRF-based interpolation for gap pixels, we compared the monthly average gap ratio of the AVHRR preliminary SCE record from 1981 to 2019 before and after HMRF-based interpolation."

                    "Answer": "The use of decision tree classification in generating snow cover extent datasets has been effective, as evidenced by the high overall accuracy (OA) of 87.4% achieved. The substantial agreement level indicated by a CK value of 0.717, along with the significant reduction in omission and commission errors compared to previous products, suggests that this method improves data accuracy and completeness.",

The new dataset, with its high spatiotemporal resolution, serves as a more reliable baseline for climate studies, offering better insights into snow cover dynamics and their implications on climate systems. The enhanced resolution addresses previous limitations and supports more precise climate modeling and analysis.",

The Landsat-5 TM maps were utilized to train the frequency distribution characteristics for cloud and snow samples. Two gap-filling strategies were implemented to generate a gap-free daily snow cover extent (SCE) record. The HMRF-based interpolation was used to improve the completeness of the dataset by filling gaps caused by clouds or swath gaps.",
