            "description": "The data set contains meteorological observation data of zhangye wetland station in the middle reaches of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.The site is located in zhangye national wetland park in gansu province.The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 100.4464E, 38.9751N, and altitude is 1460m.Air temperature and relative humidity sensors are set up at 5m and 10m, facing due north.The barometer is installed at 2m;The inverted bucket rain gauge is installed at 10m;The wind speed sensor is set up at 5m and 10m, and the wind direction sensor is set up at 10m, facing due north.The four-component radiometer is installed at 6m, facing due south;The two infrared thermometers are installed at the position of 6m, facing south, and the probe is facing vertically downward.The soil temperature probe is buried at 0cm on the surface and 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm and 40cm underground, in the south due to 2m from the meteorological tower.The soil hot flow plates (3) are successively buried in the ground 6cm;Four photosynthetic radiometers are installed above and inside the canopy respectively. The upper part of the canopy is installed at 6m (one probe vertically up and one probe vertically down), and the upper part of the canopy is installed at 0.25m (one probe vertically up and one probe vertically down), facing due south.\nObservation items are: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5m RH_5m Ta_10m, RH_10m) (unit: c, percentage), pressure (Press) (unit: hundred mpa), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), wind speed (WS_5m, WS_10m) (unit: m/s), wind (WD_10m) (unit: degrees), the radiation of four component (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts per square meter), the surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit:Degrees Celsius), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watts per square meter), soil temperature (Ts_0cm Ts_2cm Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_40cm) (unit: c), the canopy on the up and down photosynthetic active radiation (PAR_U_up, PAR_U_down) (unit: second micromoles/m2) and up and down under canopy photosynthetic active radiation (PAR_D_up, PAR_D_down) (unit: second micromoles/m2).\nProcessing and quality control of observation data :(1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10min). If data is missing, it will be marked by -6999;(2) eliminate the moments with duplicate records;(3) data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument is deleted;(4) the part marked by red letter in the data is the data in question;(5) the format of date and time is uniform, and the date and time are in the same column.For example, the time is: 2014-6-10-10:30;(6) the naming rule is: AWS+ site name.\nPlease refer to Li et al.(2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al.(2011) for observation data processing.",

Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",
                "Shuttleworth and Wallace proposed a typical two-source evapotranspiration estimation model in which the energy partition is assumed to occur in both “the above canopy” and “the under soil” cases. Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",
                "The TSEB model has undergone several revisions, improving the estimation of soil and canopy net radiation, the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface, the fractional vegetation coverage observed at the radiometer view angle, the distribution of regional-scale near-surface air temperature, and soil and canopy component temperatures. Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",
                "Accurately estimating surface fluxes in a strongly advective irrigated agricultural area is a particularly challenging task and is even more difficult when the EC flux measurements of H and LE have an incomplete energy balance closure with respect to the available energy Rn−G0. The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The estimated E/ET% and E/ET% values agreed well with the values observed using the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes technique during the early, middle, and late growing seasons.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
