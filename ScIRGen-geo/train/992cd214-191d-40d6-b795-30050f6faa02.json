            "description": "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the \"Third Pole\", and the permafrost distribution map is of great significance for engineering construction, ecological and hydrological research in the cold region. This dataset is based on the output data of the climate models participating in CMIP6, and after statistical downscaling, it is simulated and generated using the improved Noah land surface process model. This dataset provides the distribution map of permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the future for five GCMs (BCC-CSM2-MR, CESM2, EC-Earth3, MPI-ESM1-2-HR and MRI-ESM2-0) under different shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (including SSP1-2.6 , SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). The time range is 2016-2100, the time resolution is a year, the spatial resolution is 0.1°, the data format is TIFF, DN=1 represents permafrost, and DN=2 represents non-permafrost. This dataset can be used as a primary source of data for research on permafrost, ecology, hydrology, and other topics in the third polar region.",

                "As a unique geomorphological unit on Earth, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is sensitive to global warming, and has warmed twice as fast as the global average over the past five decades. The QTP, known as the “Third Pole,” has the largest area of alpine permafrost in the world. Permafrost on the QTP has been observed to have degraded substantially as a result of drastic climate warming, as evidenced by increasing ground temperature, thickening of the active layer, and continued decline. Global warming has led to permafrost degradation worldwide. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) hosts most of the world's alpine permafrost, yet its impending changes remain largely unclear, thereby affecting regional hydrological and ecological processes and the global carbon budget. Existing prediction studies have consistently concluded that QTP permafrost will degrade with climate warming, but there is no consensus on the extent of degradation."

                "To date, there have been no studies employing land surface models to predict future changes in QTP permafrost based on the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 data. Here, based on climate outputs from multi-model projections under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, we used a land surface model adapted to frozen ground modeling to simulate future changes in permafrost distribution and its thermal regimes on the QTP, and evaluated permafrost responses to various scenarios of future climate change."

            "challenges": [
                "To the best of current knowledge, these permafrost projections have several weaknesses. Previous projections are generally limited to changes in permafrost area and rarely consider changes in permafrost thermal regimes, such as those represented by mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) and active layer thickness (ALT). Most projections are based on empirical/statistical models, but such models are often data-driven and suffer from poor transferability of model parameters when applied to long-term simulations, which generally makes them unsuitable for future projections. Despite the fact that a few studies have used process-based physical models that account for water and heat exchange processes between the atmosphere and the ground, as well as local factors such as vegetation, snow cover, soil type, and moisture conditions, these models have not been specifically developed to simulate frozen ground dynamics. Most projections are based on single atmospheric driving data or simple warming scenarios, thus projection results may contain larger uncertainties stemming from the uncertainties associated with these datasets and the models that generate them. Moreover, existing predictions generally neglect the effects of climate wetting, whereas our recent study showed that climate wetting on the QTP mitigates warming-induced permafrost degradation under a warm-wet climate."

Second, we evaluated permafrost responses to various future climate changes by comparing the results simulated under different combinations of GCMs and SSPs. Finally, in order to obtain intuitive sense of how permafrost responds to climate warming on the QTP, we examined the sensitivity of permafrost to climate warming on the basis of simulated changes in permafrost and corresponding projected air temperatures from five GCMs projections under different SSPs."

The climate projection data chosen are the outputs of five GCMs with well-resolved resolution (BCC-CSM2-MR, CESM2, EC-Earth3, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, and MRI-ESM2-0) to better characterize the spatial differentiation of climate forcing on a regional scale, particularly in regions with high topography, such as the QTP."

                "Projections for SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 show that most of the continuous permafrost region of the QTP will persist through 2050. Much of the permafrost is likely to degrade in the late 21st century, with projected area losses of 44 ± 4%, 59 ± 5%, and 71 ± 7%, respectively, by 2100. The mean annual ground temperature of QTP permafrost will increase by 0.8 ± 0.2°C, 2.0 ± 0.3°C, and 2.6 ± 0.3°C under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively, and the active layer thickness will increase by 0.7 ± 0.1 m, 1.5 ± 0.3 m, and 3.0 ± 1.0 m, respectively. The surviving permafrost under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 will be thermally unstable, which is a clear warning sign of complete disappearance. The analysis of permafrost sensitivity to climate change signifies that alpine permafrost on the QTP has low resilience to climate change, in contrast to permafrost in pan-Arctic high latitudes."

                    "Answer": "Existing permafrost projections often fail to consider changes in thermal regimes because they generally rely on empirical/statistical models that focus mainly on changes in permafrost area.
