            "description": "Railway distribution map is the basic data in the mapping process. In order to facilitate the use of users, we compiled the railway data set of Heihe River basin according to the railway data set distributed by the National Basic Geographic Information Center, the atlas of Gansu Province compiled by the Gansu Provincial map Geographic Information Center, the sky map and Guge map published by the China Surveying and Mapping Bureau. This data basically reflects the distribution of Railways around the Heihe River basin around 2010.\nThe national standard of data classification and coding of national basic geographic information system - Classification and code of basic land information data (GB / T 13923-92) is adopted for railway coding, and the code is five digit code (National Basic Geographic Information Center 2010).",

This approach may differ from methods in other regions, which might rely on different local geographic information systems or alternative digital mapping services. The use of national standards for railway coding, such as the GB/T 13923-92, ensures consistency but may contrast with other regions that might use different classification systems or focus on more recent data.",

This dataset aids users by integrating information from multiple authoritative sources, including the National Geographical Information Center's railway dataset, Gansu Provincial Map Atlas, and maps from China's Mapping Bureau and Google Maps. The objective is to ensure that the dataset serves as a reliable resource for understanding and analyzing the railway infrastructure within the region.",
