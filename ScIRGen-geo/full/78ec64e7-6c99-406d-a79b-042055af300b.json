            "description": "The data include major elements, trace elements and Sr – nd Pb isotopic data. In 2018, samples were collected from the early Cretaceous Chaoyang and Beipiao volcanic rocks in the northern North China Craton. The whole rock major geochemical data were obtained by rigaku-zsx-100e X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF). The whole rock trace geochemical data were obtained by Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The whole rock SR – nd Pb isotopic compositions were obtained by sample separation and purification and multi receiver inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The data obtained can reveal the contribution of mantle and crustal melt to basic to intermediate acid volcanic rocks, and evaluate the importance of mantle derived magma underplating to the formation and evolution of continental crust in post collisional environment.",
