            "description": "This dataset contains 10 years (2010-2019) global daily surface soil moisture . The resolution is 36 km , the projection is EASE-Grid2, and the data unit is m3 / m3. This dataset adopts the soil moisture neural network retrieval algorithm developed by Yao et al. (2017，2021). This study transfers the merits of SMAP to FY-3B/MWRI through using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in which SMAP standard SSM products serve as training targets with FY-3B/MWRI brightness temperature (TB) as input. Finally, long term soil moisture data are output. The accuracy is about 5% volumetric water content，which is comparable with that of SMAP. (evaluation accuracy of 14 dense ground network globally.)",
            "instructions": "File name: The soil moisture data is stored in netcdf format, and the file name is“ NNsm-FY-yyyyddd.nc ”, where yyyy stands for year and ddd stands for Julian date. For example, NNsm-FY-2013001.nc represents this document describe the global soil moisture distribution on the first day of 2013.\n    How to read data: The data is EASE-grid equal-area projection data (with varying latitude and longitude intervals)， rather than usual equal-latitude-longitude data. (for more information about EASE-grid projection, please see https://nsidc.org/data/ease). The NC file of data stores three variables: latitude matrix, longitude matrix and soil moisture matrix, which are latitude (406*1), longitude（964*1） and soil_moisture (406*964) respectively. Projection information is not stored.\n    A. NC file can be directly read using software such as Matlab. For more information about netcdf, please see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf.\n    B. If you want to convert NC file to TIF format, you need a .tif template data with EASE-grid 36km. We provide this data named EASEGrid2_36km.tif, please see the data folder.

                "Land surface soil moisture (SM), which is the water stored in the upper soil layer, is a key variable to improve our understanding of the energy and water cycles in the Earth system; thus, it is an important parameter in climate, hydrology, and environment. SM plays a crucial role in a large number of applications, including numerical weather prediction, disaster monitoring, crop yield prediction, flood and drought damage estimation, water resources management, greenhouse gas accounting, civil protection, and epidemiological modeling of water borne diseases. SM, as a key parameter in the water cycle process, has been endorsed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as one of 50 Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), which are required to support the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Both the active and passive microwave remote sensing systems can estimate SM through the observation of backscatter signals and brightness temperatures (TBs), especially passive microwaves at low frequencies. The theoretical basis of microwave remote sensing of soil moisture is that very large differences between the dielectric constants of dry soil and liquid water lead to a very large contrast between wet soil and dry soil. However, these radiometers are easily affected by vegetation attenuation, are insensitive to soil moisture under conditions of moderate vegetation (water content greater than ~3 kg/m2), and measurements can only represent information about the top of 1 cm of soil. L-band has more advantages in the retrieval of soil moisture, because it can penetrate the atmosphere and vegetation coverage (up to ~5 kg/m2 water content), and TB represents information on the upper 5 cm of soil. The NNs method is an effective nonlinear method to establish a model. It has been widely applied in remote sensing fields, including soil moisture retrieval. The general idea is to build relationships between input data (TB/backscatter, SM) and target SMs (in situ SM, model SM, or satellite SM) through NNs training, and then retrieve SM using the trained NNs."

As shown in Fig. 1, the NNsm-FY dataset was generated with three steps:(1) data pre-processing and data matching, (2) training of soil moisture ANN model, (3) retrieval and validation of NNsm-FY dataset. Data Pre-processing. To match FY-3B TBs with SMAPL3sm, FY-3B TBs are firstly resampled to 36 km. We use the “drop in the bucket” method to resample FY-3B L1 swath data to 36 km EASE-Grid format. All swath data that fall within a 36 km grid cell are averaged together. Training of soil moisture ANN model. The training is implemented in Matlab R2018b version. Cascade-forward neural network is selected as the training model, with “hiddenSizes” being 10, “Training function” being “trainlm (Levenberg-Marquardt)” . Mean squared error (mse) is used to evaluate the performance of the neural network. The ANN model is trained to learn the relationship between the input TBs related variables and the target SMAPL3sm. The model is trained separately for each grid cell in Matlab R2018b version. Matlab randomly divide the training dataset into 3 kinds of samples: 70% training samples, 15% validation samples and 15% testing samples. Retrieval of NNsm-FY for each grid cell. After establishing the ANN relationship model between the input and the target for each grid cell, the model is applied with inputting pre-processed FY-3B TBs and MVI at the corresponding 36 km grid cell from 2010 to 2019.
