The dataset is in NETCDF format with a temporal resolution of one month and spatial resolution of 0.25°*0.25°.The units for temperature and precipitation are \"K\" and \"mm\", respectively. The dataset is based on the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) with  ERA-Interim as the boundary conditions. Compared with its driving, the higher resolution dataset that can catch the climate change characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau more detailed.",
            "instructions": "The dataset was made in NETCDF format and named as \"RAIN_mon_0.25_1979-2018.nc\" for precipitation and \"T2_mon_0.25_1979-2018.nc\" for 2 m air temperature and “wrf_HGT-LUINDEX.nc” for terrain height and land use category. The data can be read through all of the softwares that can recognize NETCDF format file, such as Python, NCL and R software, etc.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) stands over 4000 m above sea level, and is the highest and most extensive highland in the world. One of the most important findings is that the TP has undergone a faster warming rate than the global average in the past three decades. However, because of the harsh environmental conditions, observation sites are sparsely scattered over the TP where humans have relatively easy access. Global climate models (GCMs) can resolve large-scale weather systems. However, formulation of adaptation measures in response to climate change requires information at finer spatial scales. Accurate estimates of regional-scale climate are required to better understand regional climate change. Dynamic downscaling has been widely applied for downscaling reanalysis data and global climate simulations to study regional climate and climate change in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Because of the scarcity of observations over the TP, there is little literature focusing on the analysis of the regional simulation over the TP. Furthermore, the elevation-dependent warming (EDW) has been documented in the literature using observations."

Therefore, there is an unavoidable uncertainty in climate change analysis with in situ observations due to the poorly gauged observation network over the TP. Because of the scarcity of observations over the TP, there is little literature focusing on the analysis of the regional simulation over the TP. The most important issue in downscaling is under what conditions it is really capable of improving/adding more climate information at smaller scales compared to the driving GCM or reanalysis, especially when an RCM is run for a long time."

Model simulations from WRF and ERA-Int are compared to observations at 83 CMA stations. The initial lateral boundary conditions and SST were interpolated from ERA-Interim. WRF was set up with 30-km horizontal grid spacing with 1593 x 196 grid cells, which covers nearly the whole Asian continent. The vertical levels were set to 27 with the model top at 50 hPa.

The magnitude and variability of the lapse rate in the WRF simulation matches the observation much better than ERA-Int, with higher spatial correlation coefficients in both the dry and wet seasons and smaller RMSE in the wet season (Table 3). To examine the added value of the WRF simulation over ERA-Int for precipitation, Fig. 9 compares the observed annual cycle of the average precipitation and its temporal trend across the 83 stations, together with those from ERA-Int and the WRF simulation. Consistent with the observation and ERA-Int, the Prec trend in the WRF simulation shows the largest positive value in May and is closer to the observation than ERA-Int in July and August (Fig. 9b). The WRF simulated trends are closer to the observations than those in ERA-Int in the wet season."
