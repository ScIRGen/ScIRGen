            "description": "The data are the whole rock major, trace element and Sr-Nd isotopic data of the granite in Xishan pluton, Guangdong Province, as well as zircon U-Pb isotopic dating, Hf isotopic composition and trace element data, molybdenite Re-Os isotopic dating and cassiterite U-Pb isotopic dating. The whole rock sample is K-feldspar granite from Xishan pluton, zircon is chosen from K-feldspar granite, molybdenite and cassiterite are from cassiterite-quartz vein in Xishan deposit. The major and trace elements of the whole rock are obtained by XRF and ICP-MS analysis, respectively. the F content is obtained by ion electrode analysis, the Cl content is obtained by ion chromatography analysis, and the Sr-Nd isotopic composition is obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis.  In-situ U-Pb ages of zircon and cassiterite and in-situ ziron trace element were all obtained by LA-ICP-MS. In situ Hf isotopic compositions of zircons were obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. The Re-Os isotopic composition of molybdenite was obtained by ICP-MS. The above data have been published in SCI journals (LITHOS), and the data are true and reliable. Based on the data obtained, the genesis of Xishan pluton and its relationship with Sn-W deposit can be discussed.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity of collecting accurate isotopic and elemental data from granite and mineral samples in geological studies can be attributed to the requirement of specialized analytical techniques like XRF, ICP-MS, and LA-ICP-MS for main, trace, and isotopic compositions. The precision needed for in-situ analyses such as LA-MC-ICP-MS for zircon Hf isotopes and the challenges in accurately dating minerals using U-Pb and Re-Os isotopic systems also contribute to this complexity. Additionally, ensuring the reliability of the data for exploring the genesis of igneous bodies and their relation to Sn-W mineralization adds to the intricacies involved in the data collection process.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of collecting comprehensive geochemical and isotopic data from granite and mineral samples is to investigate the genesis of the Xishan deep-seated igneous body and its connection with Sn-W deposits. By analyzing whole-rock major, trace elements, and isotopic compositions, researchers aim to understand the geological processes that led to the formation of these deposits. The data allows for a detailed examination of the rock and mineral compositions, which provides insights into the formation environment and the magmatic evolution of the area.",

                    "Answer": "To ensure accuracy and reliability, geochemical data from granite samples are collected using several analytical methods: whole-rock major and trace elements are obtained via XRF and ICP-MS, F content by ion electrode analysis, Cl content by ion chromatography, and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions by MC-ICP-MS. Zircon in-situ U-Pb ages and trace element data, as well as cassiterite in-situ U-Pb ages, are acquired using LA-ICP-MS. Zircon in-situ Hf isotopic compositions are determined via LA-MC-ICP-MS, while molybdenite Re-Os isotopic compositions are obtained through ICP-MS. These methods ensure the data are accurate and reliable for exploring the genesis of the deep-seated pluton and its relationship with Sn-W mineralization.",
