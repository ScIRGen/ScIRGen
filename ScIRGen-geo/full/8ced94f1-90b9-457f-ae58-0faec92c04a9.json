            "description": "This data set mainly includes fluid inclusion data and h, O isotope data of scheelite, wolframite, fluorapatite and quartz in Dahutang deposit, as well as major element data of altered mineral chlorite. In 2018, the samples were collected from the Dahutang w-cu-mo deposit in South China. The major element composition of chlorite was measured by electron microprobe microanalysis, the fluid inclusion data was measured by Linkam MDS 600 and Renishaw RM2000 laser Raman microprobe, and the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of minerals was measured by thermo Finnigan Deltaplus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). According to the measured data, the evolution process of ore-forming fluid in Dahutang deposit is constrained.",
            "instructions": "All data are stored in Excel file, the name of hydrogen and oxygen isotope data file is \"summary of oxygen and hydrogen isotope data from the Dahutang. Xlsx\", and the name of fluid inclusion microthermal data on fluid inclusions of the Dahutang.
