It is generated from the big data (e.g., ground-based measurements, satellite remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and model simulations) using artificial intelligence by considering the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of air pollution. This is the big data-derived seamless (spatial coverage = 100%) daily, monthly, and yearly 1 km (i.e., D1K, M1K, and Y1K) ground-level PM10 dataset in China from 2000 to present. This dataset yields a high quality with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.90 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 21.12 µg m-3 on a daily basis. Note that this dataset is continuously updated, and if you want to apply for more data or have any questions, please contact me (Email: weijing_rs@163.com; weijing@umd.edu).\nThe data file contains four codes (Python, Matlab, IDL and R language) nc2geotiff codes for NC to GeoTiff.\n",

                "Respirable particles with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 10 µm (PM10) have important impacts on the atmospheric environment and human health. While PM10 mainly comes from nature, e.g., dust, soil, and sea salt, anthropogenic activities also play an important role in the emission of PM10, such as construction-generated dust, insufficient combustion of fossil fuels, and discharge of industrial residues. PM10 is thus of great concern to both the atmospheric environment and human health, given its potential contribution to cancer, respiratory diseases, and heart diseases, especially in developing countries like China. The Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection has thus established a national ground-based monitoring network to monitor typical air pollutants (e.g., PM10, PM2.5, ozone, and sulfur dioxide) in real time. Satellite remote sensing has the advantage of providing complete and uniform coverage. A positive relationship between AOD and near-surface PM concentrations has been shown despite uncertainties due to various sources of the retrievals. At present, satellite-based PM estimation methods fall into four main categories: physical models, chemical models, statistical regression models, and artificial intelligence. Despite these efforts, further improvements can be made in estimating near-surface PM10 concentrations in China."

This method was used to establish robust PM10-AOD relationships. A high-quality PM10 dataset at a spatial resolution of 1 km covering China was finally generated from the STET model, i.e., ChinaHighPM10, using the newly released MODIS 1-km Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product, along with meteorological, land use, topography, and population data as input."

                "Despite these efforts, further improvements can be made in estimating near-surface PM10 concentrations in China. First, traditional physical, chemical, and statistical regression models generally have less data mining abilities than do machine learning methods. Second, most previous studies employed MODIS AOD products generated from the Dark Target (DT) or Deep Blue (DB) aerosol algorithms at spatial resolutions of 3 – 10 km. The coarse-resolution PM10 dataset generated thus has limited applications in medium- or small-scale areas such as urban regions where air pollution is much more locally concentrated than in rural regions. Last, PM10 is less intensively studied than PM2.5 in China, possibly because coarser particles have less impact on human health for the same mass concentration."

Second, a training set (n) is randomly selected from all data samples (N), and m features are randomly selected from all features (M) without replacement. Then a split (s*) is selected among all generated splits (S) according to the calculated scores (s*, S), and an extremely randomized tree is built based on the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) algorithm. Last, the above steps are repeated to construct numerous extremely randomized trees as weak classifiers, which are then combined to form a strong classifier."

High levels of PM10 concentration occurred in northwest China (e.g., the Tarim Basin) and the Northern China Plain. Overall, PM10 concentrations had a significant declining trend of 5.81 μg/m3 per year (p < 0.001) over the past five years in China, especially in three key urban agglomerations.
