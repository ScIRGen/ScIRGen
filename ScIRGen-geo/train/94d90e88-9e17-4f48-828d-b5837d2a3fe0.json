            "description": "This data is a simulated output data set of 5km monthly hydrological data obtained by establishing the WEB-DHM distributed hydrological model of the source regions of Yangtze River and Yellow River, using temperature, precipitation and pressure as input data, and GAME-TIBET data as verification data. The dataset includes grid runoff and evaporation (if the evaporation is less than 0, it means deposition; if the runoff is less than 0, it means that the precipitation in the month is less than evaporation). This data is a model based on the WEB-DHM distributed hydrological model, and established by using temperature, and precipitation (from itp-forcing and CMA) as input data, GLASS, MODIA, AVHRR as vegetation data, and SOILGRID and FAO as soil parameters. And by the calibration and verification of runoff，soil temperature and soil humidity, the 5 km monthly grid runoff and evaporation in the source regions of Yangtze River and Yellow River from 1998 to 2017 was obtained.

This model uses specific datasets like GAME-TIBET for validation, and it incorporates vegetation data (from GLASS, MODIA, AVHRR) and soil parameters (from SOILGRID and FAO) to accurately simulate the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.",

The model also requires soil parameters from SOILGRID and FAO, and the calibration and validation of runoff, soil temperature, and moisture data further contribute to the challenges in accurately simulating the 5km monthly gridded runoff and evaporation from 1998 to 2017.",

This approach helps in capturing the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources over a large and diverse region like the Yangtze and Yellow River sources.

                    "Answer": "The WEB-DHM distributed hydrological model is used to simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources by taking inputs like temperature, precipitation, and air pressure. The GAME-TIBET data is employed for validation purposes. The model uses input data derived from sources such as itp-forcing and CMA, and vegetation data from GLASS, MODIA, and AVHRR, along with soil parameters from SOILGRID and FAO. Calibration and validation are performed by adjusting the model to match observed runoff and soil moisture and temperature data, resulting in a 5km monthly grid dataset of runoff and evaporation for the period 1998-2017.
