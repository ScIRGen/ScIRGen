            "description": "The late Mesozoic Magmatic arc of the South Qiangtang terrane is related to the long-term subduction of Bangong Lake Nujiang Tethys ocean and the subsequent collision of Lhasa Qiangtang terrane. However, the geological evolution from oceanic lithosphere subduction to continental collision is not clear. In view of this scientific problem, through the study of volcanic rocks in mudijiangya area of South Qiangtang terrane, the following achievements and understandings have been obtained（ 1) Zircon U-Pb dating data of two groups of volcanic rocks in mudijiangya area, Shuanghu County, central Qinghai Tibet Plateau show that the volcanic rocks of qushenla formation were formed at 114 Ma and those of abushan formation were formed at 76-75 ma（ 2) The original magma of the volcanic rocks in the qushenla formation may be derived from partial melting of mantle peridotite contaminated by crustal materials, which is related to the plate rotation of the northward subducted Bangong Nujiang Tethys oceanic crust（ 3) The original magma of volcanic rocks in the abushan formation may be a mixture of crustal melt and asthenospheric mantle, which is related to the lithospheric delamination in the Lhasa Qiangtang collision area.",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method involves analyzing zircon U-Pb ages in volcanic rocks from regions like the Mu Di Jiang Ya area in central Tibet. The obtained zircon U-Pb data, for instance, shows that the Qushenla volcanic rocks formed around 114 Ma, while the Abushan volcanic rocks formed between 76-75 Ma. These data contribute to understanding the tectonic evolution by highlighting the magmatic processes related to the subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethys Ocean and subsequent collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes.",

                    "Answer": "The U-Pb zircon dating patterns suggest that the formation of the volcanic rocks occurred at different times, with the Qushenla volcanic rocks forming at 114 Ma and the Abushan volcanic rocks forming at 76-75 Ma. These patterns can be interpreted to indicate distinct magmatic events related to the northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan oceanic crust and subsequent lithospheric processes associated with the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision.",

                    "Answer": "The complexity arises from the need to understand the geological evolution from oceanic lithosphere subduction to continental collision, which involves analyzing volcanic rocks formed at different times and under varying tectonic settings. Specifically, obtaining accurate zircon U-Pb ages requires detailed examination of volcanic rocks like those in the Muji Jiangya area, where the formation times and magma sources are influenced by crustal contamination, mantle partial melting, and lithospheric processes such as slab rollback and lithosphere delamination associated with the Bangong-Nujiang Tethys Ocean and Lhasa-Qiangtang collision.",

This data aids in understanding the geological evolution from oceanic subduction to continental collision, showing links between volcanic formation and tectonic events such as the subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethys Ocean and the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision.",
