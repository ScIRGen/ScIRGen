            "description": "This dataset is the water balance dataset in the Yellow River source region and Qilian Mountains in the future 50 years (runoff, precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil liquid water content). It is simulated by the Geomorphology-Based Ecohydrological Model (GBEHM). The variables in the dataset include monthly runoff, monthly precipitation, monthly evapotranspiration, the monthly average 5cm soil liquid water content and the monthly average 50cm soil liquid water content. The temporal range is 2020-2070 and the spatial resolution is 1 km. The input data of the model include meteorological forcings, vegetation, soil and land use data, and the meteorological forcings are obtained from the ensemble mean of 38 CMIP6 models under SSP2-4.5 scenario. The simulation results can reflect the spatio-temporal changes of the hydrological variables in the Yellow River source region and Qilian Mountains. The dataset can be further used for researches into the eco-hydrological processes in the Yellow River source region and Qilian Mountains, and help provide a scientific basis for the optimal allocation of \" mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes and grasslands \" system.",
            "instructions": "The variables in the dataset include monthly runoff (R), monthly precipitation (P), monthly evapotranspiration (ET), monthly average 5cm soil liquid water content (w_l1) and monthly average 50cm soil liquid water content (w_l2). The naming method is variable name + year + month. The data is stored in ASCII form and can be opened and used directly in ArcGIS.",
