            "description": "The global reach-level 3-hourly river flood reanalysis (GRFR) dataset includes 1) global 0.05 degree, 3-hourly/daily runoff data, 2) 3hourly/daily naturalized river discharge at 2.94 million river reaches, 3) global 3-hourly river flood events from 1980 to 2019, 4) underlying hydrography MERIT-Basins.\nGrounded on recent breakthroughs in global runoff hydrology, river modeling, high-resolution hydrography, and climate reanalysis, the 3-hourly river discharge record globally for 2.94 million river reaches during the 40-yr period of 1980–2019 was developed. The underlying modeling chain consists of the VIC land surface model (0.05°, 3-hourly) that is well calibrated and bias-corrected and the RAPID routing model (2.94 million river and catchment vectors), with precipitation input from MSWEP and other meteorological fields downscaled from ERA5. Flood events (above 2-yr return) and their characteristics (number, spatial distribution, and seasonality) were extracted and studied. Validations against 3-hourly flow records from 6,000+ gauges in CONUS and daily records from 14,000+ gauges globally show good modeling performance across all flow ranges, good skills in reconstructing flood events (high extremes), and the benefit of (and need for) sub-daily modeling.\nThe GRFR database represents a pioneering effort on global reach-level flood reanalysis and may offer new opportunities for global flood studies in terms of baseline data and potential research pathways. Also, it can better help river-observing satellite missions to develop their discharge algorithms.",

                "Floods are among the most frequent and costly natural disasters. According to a United Nations report (UNISDR 2015), floods accounted for 43% of occurrences of natural disasters during 1995–2015. The EM-DAT international disaster database indicates that fluvial floods contributed to two-thirds of flood events in the past two decades. Fluvial flood is the extreme upper tail of river hydrology that can happen at different scales. The lack of global long-term fine-scale (in both time and space) river discharge (Q) records has been the major hurdle for large-scale flood research. There are large gaps in river gauge data around the world as most gauges are concentrated in developed areas like North America and Europe. The other observational alternative is remote sensing, though the first satellite mission dedicated to discharge estimation will not launch until 2022. Continuous efforts have been made by the modeling community to quantify river discharge globally with increasingly finer spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent global studies with vector networks have illustrated their efficiency at high resolutions."

                "We downscaled forcing fields to 0.05° using fine-scale elevation as the correction factor for temperature (fixed lapse rate of −6.5°C km−1), surface pressure (hydrostatic), longwave radiation (lapse adjustment for radiative temperature), humidity (lapse adjustment for saturated vapor pressure), wind speed (bilinear interpolation), and precipitation (bilinear interpolation). To reduce model biases, we performed grid-level parameter calibration and bias correction (postprocessing) against ML-derived, global runoff characteristic maps from the Global Streamflow Characteristics Dataset (GSCD). Instead of calibrating VIC against limited gauge observations, we calibrated three VIC parameters (infiltration curve shape, second soil layer thickness, and nonlinear baseflow threshold) at 0.25° grid pixel level, using the baseflow index, mean runoff, and runoff percentiles (Q10 and Q90) from the GSCD, and then resampled the parameters to 0.05° by bilinear interpolation. To reduce the remaining model biases after calibration, we applied the sparse cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching bias correction approach, which corrects the VIC runoff biases against nine runoff percentiles (Q1, Q5, Q10, Q20, Q50, Q80, Q90, Q95, and Q99) from the GSCD. The model was spun up for the 10-yr period of 1969–78 forced with downscaled Princeton Global Forcing (PGF) which has an original resolution of 0.25°. We implemented RAPID, a river routing model that uses a matrix-based version of the Muskingum method to calculate the flow and volume of water for each reach on a river network. Here, RAPID is run using a 30-min time step and forced with 3-hourly lateral inflows from VIC runoff."

Validation of GRFR against 3-hourly flow records from 6,000+ gauges in CONUS and daily records from 14,000+ gauges globally shows good general skills of discharge estimates across all flow values, as well as good skills in reconstructing flood events (high extremes)."

The effort to enable subdaily high-resolution modeling is expected to offer added values in capturing subdaily dynamics that may come with local and flashy events. The comparison between 3-hourly peaks and daily peaks highlights the significant benefit of (and need for) subdaily modeling for flood extremes. Precipitation sensitivity analysis suggests that, over well-gauged areas, the global product MSWEP performs very close to local product (Stage IV)."

Additionally, a model calibration process is employed, where parameters are calibrated against global runoff characteristic maps and biases are corrected using a sparse CDF matching bias correction approach. A river routing model like RAPID is then used to simulate river flow using inflows from a hydrological model.",
