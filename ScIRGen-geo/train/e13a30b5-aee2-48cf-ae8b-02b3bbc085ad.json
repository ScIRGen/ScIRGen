            "description": "On 30 June 2012 (UTC+8), TASI sensor carried by the Harbin Y-12 aircraft was used in a visible near Infrared hyperspectral airborne remote sensing experiment, which is located in the observation experimental area (30×30 km), Linze region and Heihe riverway. The relative flight altitude is 2500 meters. The wavelength of TASI is 8-11.5 μm with a spatial resolution of 3 meters. \nThrough the ground sample points and atmospheric data, the data are recorded in surface radiance processed by geometric correction and atmospheric correction. Land surface temperature (LST) data was retrieved by temperature/emissivity separation algorithm.",

                "LAND surface emissivity (LSE) is a basic parameter in surface–atmosphere interaction processes and plays an important role in deriving land surface temperature (LST), as well as long-wave energy budget estimates. As an intrinsic property of natural materials, the LSE is always regarded as an indicator for the surface composition and is widely used in mineral mapping and studies of soil erosion. In a typical land cover, water and dense vegetation have a stable high emissivity in the thermal infrared (TIR) region, whereas bare surface has relatively low emissivity, which varies with the spectral wavelength, viewing angle, surface roughness, soil moisture (SM), and composition. Laboratory and field measurements have revealed that SM has a significant effect on the LSE, particularly in the 8–9.5-μm region. The impact of SM on the LSE was well known from ground-based experiments; however, studies using remote sensing data to analyze this effect have been limited. Both the laboratory measurements and the remote sensing observations indicated that the SM has large temporal and spatial variation and that the SM effects on the LSE should be taken into account to improve the accuracy of long-wave energy balance models."

The data of the GB and HZZ sites yielded satisfying results, with determination coefficients of 0.9429 and 0.7705, respectively. The SSW site was slightly worse, which might due to the relatively small SM variation range and the emissivity uncertainty. This study confirms that the emissivity-SM dependence previously inferred under laboratory conditions is also valid for the satellite data. In addition, the modeled BBE showed that the emissivity diurnal variation for specific soil is so significant that it should not be neglected in the day/night LST algorithm."

LSE reflecting the land surface emission feature is widely applied in geological research, mineral mapping and so on. Quantitative remote sensing inversion is an important approach to retrieve LST&E on regional and global scale. As the multi-spectral and hyperspectral thermal infrared sensors appear, deriving the LST&E simultaneously becomes possible. Except for the space-borne sensors such as MODIS and ASTER, various airborne multispectral and hyperspectral thermal infrared sensors play important role on regional survey and scientific research for their flexibility and finer spatial resolution. At the same time, algorithms for extracting LST/LSE information from the data collected by these airborne sensors have been subsequently proposed and yielded satisfactory result. However, the emissivity validation using in situ data has been barely presented. TASI is a new generation of commercial hyperspectral infrared sensors released by ITRES, Canada in 2006, aiming to the detection of land surface temperature and emission characteristics and applications like mineral mapping, land mining and gas exploration."
