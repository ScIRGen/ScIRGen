            "description": "The melting observation of Hengduan Moutain glacier is mainly carried out on Hailuogou Glacier on the east slope of Gongga and the large and small Gongba glacier on the west slope of Gongga. In addition, some ablation observations have been made on Baishui 1 glacier on the east slope of Yulong. According to the melting observation of the four glaciers in the above two mountains, there are some regional representativeness, which makes them reflect the basic situation of melting glaciers in Hengduan Mountain. This data set records the glacier ablation data of different time and different places: from June to August 1982, the Glacier No. 1 in Baishui on the east slope of Yulong mountain was observed at the altitude of 4200m, 4600m and 4800m. From August 27, 1982 to the end of August 1983, the annual measured data of different heights of Hailuogou Glacier tongue on the east slope of Gongga Mountain were collected. From July 12, 1982 to August 6, 1983, the observation data of Gongba glacier melting on the west slope of Gongga Mountain were recorded.",
            "instructions": "The data are stored in the form of xlsx, which can be viewed and edited by Excel software in Microsoft office. Four workbooks are included, which are the melting status of Baishui No.1 glacier on the east slope of Yulong, the melting values of Hailuogou Glacier from 1982 to 1983, the melting values of Gongba glacier from 1982 to 1983, and the melting data of xiaogongba glacier from June 29 to August 21, 1982. The altitude, ablation depth and ablation rate of the four regions are described in detail in the table.",

On the western slope at the Gongga Glaciers, the observations span from July 12, 1982, to August 6, 1983, focusing on melting data. The eastern slope data provides a full year of continuous data, while the specific time frames for the western slope are less detailed.",

By analyzing melting data from altitudes of 4200m, 4600m, and 4800m on Yulong Mountain, and throughout the year at varying heights on Gongga Mountain, researchers can infer how altitude affects melting rates and the potential impact of regional climate variations across these ranges.",

                    "Answer": "The regional representativeness of a dataset focused on glacier ablation in areas like the Hengduan Mountains is contributed by the inclusion of multiple observation sites across different glaciers, such as the Hailuogou Glacier on the eastern slope of Gongga Mountain, the Da and Xiao Gongba Glaciers on the western slope, and the Baishui No. 1 Glacier on the eastern slope of Yulong Mountain. These sites provide data from different altitudes and time periods, which helps in reflecting the general situation of glacier ablation in the region.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of collecting glacier ablation data across different elevations in the Hengduan Mountains is to provide a regional representation of glacier melt, reflecting the basic conditions of glacier ablation in this area. The data collected from various locations and elevations, such as the Hailuogou Glacier on the eastern slope of Mount Gongga and the Baishui No. 1 Glacier on the eastern slope of Mount Yulong, aim to capture the variability and patterns of glacier melt over time and altitude, which are crucial for understanding regional climate impacts and glacier dynamics.",
