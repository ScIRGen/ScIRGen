            "description": "This dataset includes stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonates in a 180 m-long sediment core retrieved from Lop Nor, Tarim Basin. Sedimentary carbon and oxygen isotopes from carbonates are two of the most commonly used proxies in paleoclimatic studies, as they have the potential to record past variations in hydrology and vegetation. The sediment samples were grounded and sieved through a 100 mesh screen, and then directly analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (MAT-252) with an automated carbonate preparation device (Kiel Ⅱ). Typical analytical errors are within ±0.06‰ and ±0.08‰ for carbon isotope and oxygen isotope, respectively. Based on the high-resolution stable carbon and oxygen isotope data of core Lop Nor, the evolution history of arid environment in the Taklimakan Desert since the Pleistocene can be reconstructed, allowing further exploring of trends, variability and mechanisms of regional climate change. Field photos dataset of the Tibetan Plateau include photos of the stratigraphic profiles.",

Although the onset of Asian desertification is proposed to have started in the earliest Miocene, prevailing desert environment in the Tarim Basin, currently providing much of the Asian eolian dust sources, is only a geologically recent phenomenon. Once part of the Neo-Tethys Sea, indicated by the Paleogene littoral-neritic deposits with intercalated marine strata, the Tarim Basin in western China has experienced dramatic environmental and depositional changes during the Cenozoic. The Tibetan Plateau uplift, long-term global cooling, and the associated retreat of the remnant sea during the Cenozoic, through their complex interplay, may have all contributed to the enhanced aridification in the Asian interior and eventually the desert formation. The existing evidence, although still limited, would point to the occurrence of a possible megalake in the Tarim Basin during the Late Miocene."

Superimposed on the orbitally episodic changes, the δ18O record also shows a long-term trend of deteriorating lacustrine conditions at 4.9–7.1 Ma. Therefore, our multiple-proxy results consistently show that the Taklimakan sand sea began to form at ∼4.9 Ma and that the transition into prevailing desert environment was permanent and irreversible."
