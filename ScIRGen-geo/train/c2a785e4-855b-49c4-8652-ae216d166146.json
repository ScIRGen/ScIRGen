            "description": "1) The data includes the soil erosion modulus of 15 watersheds with a resolution of 2.5 m in the year of 2019 in Pakistan. 2）Based on the surface layer of rainfall erosivity R, soil erodibility K, slope length factor LS, vegetation coverage FVC, and rotation sampling survey unit, the Chinese soil erosion model (CSLE) was used to calculate soil erosin modulus in 15 watersheds respectively. Through spatial data processing (including chart linking and transformation, vector-grid conversion, and resampling),  R, K, LS factors were calculated from the regional thematic map of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and DEM. By half-month FVC, NPV, half-month rainfall erosivity data, we calculated the value of B factors  in each sampling watershed. The value of E factor was calculated based on the remote sensing interpretation result and engineering measure factor table. The value of tillage factor T was obtained from tillage zoning map and tillage measure table. And then the soil erosion modulus in each sampling watershed was calculated by the equation: A=R•K•LS•B•E•T. The selection of 15 watersheds was based on the layout of sampling survey in pan-third polar region. 3) Compared with the data of soil erosion intensity in the same region in the same year, there is no significant difference and the data quality is good.4) the data of soil erosion modulus is of great significance for studying the present situation of soil erosion in Pan third polar region, and it is also crucial for the implementation of the development policy of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating multiple data factors like rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length, and cover management factors allows for a comprehensive evaluation of soil erosion. This approach enhances the accuracy of soil erosion assessments by incorporating various elements that influence erosion rates. By using spatial data operations and remote sensing interpretations, the assessments can account for diverse environmental and management conditions across different regions, leading to more precise evaluations of soil erosion status.",

                    "Answer": "Calculating soil erosion modulus using high-resolution data in small watersheds in Pakistan is important for accurately assessing soil erosion conditions in the region. The goal is to evaluate the soil erosion status effectively, which is significant for understanding the current state of soil erosion in the broader Third Pole area. This assessment also supports the implementation of the 'Belt and Road' development policy by providing reliable data on soil erosion.",

                    "Answer": "The process involves using the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) model, which is represented as A=R•K•LS•B•E•T. The steps include calculating the soil erosion modulus for each of the 15 watershed sampling units based on various factors: rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), vegetation cover (FVC), and management practices (B). Spatial data operations such as raster-vector conversion, resampling, and thematic mapping are utilized to derive R, K, and LS factors from regional maps of rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility. The B factor for different land types within sampling units is calculated using bi-weekly FVC and rainfall erosivity weights, while engineering measures and tillage factors are determined through remote sensing interpretation and tillage zone maps. Challenges in this process may include ensuring accurate spatial data transformations, maintaining data quality across diverse topographies, and integrating multiple data sources seamlessly.",
