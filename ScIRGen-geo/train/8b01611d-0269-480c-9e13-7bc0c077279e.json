            "description": "The soil surface roughness data set measured simultaneously during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR) in 2018, which covers (1) 30 quadrats in the north-south flight region of 70 km ×12 km typical experimental area, and (2) 8 quadrats in the northeast-southwest flight region of 165 km×5 km complex experimental area. The data were measured on September 17, September 18 and September 20, 2018 respectively. The soil surface roughness along the row (East-West) direction and cross the row (North-South) direction of typical features in each sample area were measured. The surface roughness of the dataset is described using three parameters; root mean square height (RMSH) and correlation length (CL). The root mean square height describes the random surface characteristics, while the correlation length and correlation function describe the periodicity of the surface. The surface roughness was calculated through the steps of soil surface height digitization, slope correction, periodic correction, and roughness calculation.",
            "instructions": "The surface roughness data file is LuanRiver_Surface_Roughness.xls. This file contains two sheets with name of corresponding flight region. There are two roughness parameters including RMSH and CL at two directions for each quarter, for which 01 indicates along row(east-west) direction and 02 indicates cross row (south-north) direction.\n The location and land cover of sampling site file is Sampling_Location.xls, which contains name of the quadrat, the land cover and the longitude and latitude of the sampling location.",

                    "Answer": "A data collection method for capturing surface roughness in a river basin involves conducting ground synchronous observations across various sample areas. This method was applied in the Luan River Basin during a soil moisture remote sensing experiment. Observations were made in two different directions: east-west (or parallel to ridges) and north-south (or perpendicular to ridges) to measure the roughness of typical land cover within each sample area. The surface roughness was represented by the root mean square height for vertical roughness and the correlation length for horizontal roughness. These measurements were taken on specific dates in September 2018, covering multiple sample areas with varying complexity.",

These objectives influence the choice of data collection methods by necessitating ground-based synchronized observations that cover both typical and complex experimental areas.

                    "Answer": "The procedures for measuring and calculating surface roughness in a dataset related to land surface roughness observation involve several steps. First, the surface height data is digitalized, which converts the physical measurements into digital format. Next, slope correction is applied to adjust for any inclination in the terrain that might skew the roughness measurements. Periodic correction follows, which accounts for any repeating patterns or cycles in the terrain that could affect the accuracy of roughness calculations. Finally, the roughness is quantified using metrics such as root mean square height for vertical roughness and correlation length for horizontal roughness.",
