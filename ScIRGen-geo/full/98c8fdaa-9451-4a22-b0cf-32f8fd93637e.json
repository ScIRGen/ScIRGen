                "Understanding the changes in number and areal extent of lakes, as well as their abundance and size distribution is important for assessments of regional and global water resources, biogeochemical cycles, and changes in climate. Lakes are known to affect regional climate, exchanging heat and water with the atmosphere. The emission of greenhouse gasses from lakes is one of the essential components of the global carbon cycle, also potentially regulating climate change. The abundance and size distribution of lakes, therefore, play a significant role in regional and global biogeochemical cycles. Most of the world’s lakes are thought to exist in glacierized terrains, and the total area of glaciers on the TP and its surrounding area is around 100,000 km2. The lake areas and water levels tend to increase as climate warms, accompanying an accelerated retreat of glaciers and an increase in net precipitation. Lakes on the TP are rarely influenced by human activities, and are, therefore, the representative of natural water bodies."

This study provides the first detailed lake inventory of the TP, as well as an evaluation of the lake size distribution in this area."

                "The accuracy of the extracted lake areas may be controlled by pixel size, image quality as affected by clouds, snow and glaciers and shadow coverage, classification algorithms, and the experience of the researcher. The seasonal variations and inconsistency in the dates of acquisition of the Landsat data could result in some uncertainties, due to the limited availability of data. However, seasonal fluctuations in lake area on the TP are small, compared to lakes in the more humid South China region."

                "In this study, changes in lake area greater than 1 km2 are mapped using Landsat datasets, spanning the 1970s, 1990, 2000, and 2010. In addition, high-resolution images (GeoCover Landsat mosaic 2000, with a pixel size of 14.25 m) are used for the first time to map lakes as small as 0.001 km2 across the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP)."

Ninety-nine new lakes are identified between the 1970s and 2010, 71 of which are found between 1990 and 2010. This indicates the accelerated glacier melt and/or increased difference of precipitation minus evaporation since the 1990s. More than 80 % of the lakes show an increase in their area between the 1970s and 2010. Around 96 % of all lakes are small, with an area <1 km2, while the 1,204 large lakes (>1 km2) account for 96 % of the total lake area. The TP is subdivided into 12 greater drainage basins, and of these the inner TP dominates in terms of the number of lakes (55.03 %), the total area of lakes (66 %), and lake density (0.026/km2 compared to the mean, 0.011/km2). A plot of lake abundance against size shows that the size distribution of lakes departs from a typical power-law distribution, but displays such a distribution at the mean elevation (4,715 m), with an r2 value of 0.97 and a slope of -0.66. The slopes of the abundance-size equations from each of the 12 greater basins, and from all basins together, are larger than -1, supporting the inference that larger lakes, rather than the small lakes, contribute more to the total lake surface area across the TP."

More than 80 % of the lakes show an increase in their area between the 1970s and 2010. Around 96 % of all lakes are small, with an area <1 km², while the 1,204 large lakes (>1 km²) account for 96 % of the total lake area. A plot of lake abundance against size shows that the size distribution of lakes departs from a typical power-law distribution, but displays such a distribution at the mean elevation (4,715 m), with an r2 value of 0.97 and a slope of -0.66. The slopes of the abundance-size equations from each of the 12 greater basins, and from all basins together, are larger than -1, supporting the inference that larger lakes, rather than the small lakes, contribute more to the total lake surface area across the TP.",
