            "description": "The data includes U-Pb isotope dating analysis of cassiterite and monazite in albite granite, analysis of major and trace elements of the whole-rock, and mineral composition analysis of mica, spodumene, and pollucite. The U-Pb isotope dating results of cassiterite and monazite were obtained using laser ablation inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major element analysis of the whole rock was obtained using X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The trace element analysis of the whole rock was obtained using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The major element data of minerals was obtained using EPMA, and the trace element data of minerals was obtained using laser ablation inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data was collected from Tsalung valley, Gyirong. The data provides the age and composition of pollucite-lepidolite-bearing rocks discovered for the first time in Tibet, providing important information for understanding regional rare metal mineralization.",
