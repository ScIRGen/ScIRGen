The data set is classified by the Landsat 8 image through an expert decision tree and corrected by manual visual interpretation. The spatial resolution of the image is 30m, using the WGS 1984 UTM projected coordinate system, and the data format is grid format. The image is divided into five types of land, the land type 1 is “water body”, the land type 2 is “high-cover vegetation”, the land type 3 is “naked land”, and the land type 4 is “low-cover vegetation”, and the land type 5 is For \"marsh\", low-coverage vegetation and high-coverage vegetation are distinguished by vegetation coverage. The threshold is 0.1 to 0.4 for low-cover vegetation and 0.4 to 1 for high-cover vegetation.",
            "instructions": "The dataset files are uniformly packaged in the “result” folder, and the “resultgrid” grid format file can be opened using ArcGis software to view the classification results of the Yellow River source marsh.

We employed the 18-GHz horizontal polarization channel and 37-GHz vertically polarized channel from the SMMR data, and the 19-GHz horizontal channel and 37-GHz vertically polarized channel from the SSM/I and SSMIS data. Using the regression coefficients presented by Liu et al. (2005), Jezek et al. (1991) and Abdalati et al. (1995), the SMMR, SSM/I F11 and SSM/I F13 data are converted into SSM/I F8 equivalent values for the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. In addition, to validate the result, the temperature measurements of automatic weather stations (AWSs) in Antarctica and Greenland were also collected. We use in situ data to validate the daily snowmelt detection results of each method. For processing the AWS data, we chose the daily mean air temperature data from the summer months (November /C1 March) in Antarctica. Once the corresponding daily detection results have been obtained by using the snowmelt detection method, the following defined quantities (Celik 2010) are computed for comparing the daily detection results against the corresponding daily mean air temperature data."

                    "Answer": "Researchers might face challenges in validating snowmelt detection results with automatic weather station temperature data because the spatial resolution of satellite data is much coarser than point measurements from weather stations. This mismatch can lead to discrepancies when comparing remote sensing-based snowmelt detection results with localized temperature readings.",

                    "Answer": "To ensure consistency in brightness temperature data across different sensors, a cross-correction of brightness temperatures is performed before melt detection. This involves using regression coefficients to convert SMMR, SSM/I F11, and SSM/I F13 data into SSM/I F8 equivalent values for the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. This step is crucial for maintaining temporal consistency in the datasets used for monitoring the ice-sheet snowmelt.",

Techniques such as wavelet transformation and variance analysis are used to manage these challenges by extracting and analyzing edge information and distinguishing melt processes. Additionally, spatial neighborhood error correction operators help address errors caused by noise.",
