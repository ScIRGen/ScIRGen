            "description": "This data set includes observation data of meteorological elements in the Shenshawo Desert Station in the middle of the Heihe Hydrometeorological Observation Network from January 1, 2015 to April 12, 2015. The site is located in Shenshawo, Zhangye City, Gansu Province, and the underlying surface is desert. The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 100.4933E, 38.7892N, and the altitude is 1594m. The air temperature and relative humidity sensors are installed at 5m and 10m, facing the north; the barometer is installed at 2m; the tipping bucket rain gauge is installed at 10m; the wind speed sensor is set at 5m, 10m, and the wind direction sensor is set at 10m, facing the north; the four-component radiometer is installed at 6m, facing south; two infrared thermometers are installed at 6m, facing south, the probe orientation is vertically downward; the soil temperature probe is buried in the ground surface 0cm and underground 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm 40cm, 60cm and 100cm, in the south of the 2m from the meteorological tower; soil moisture sensors are buried in the underground 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 60cm and 100cm, in the south of the 2m from the meteorological tower, and among them a repetitive soil moisture sensor (Ms_40cm_2) was embedded in the underground 40cm on May 6, 2014.soil heat flux plates (3 pieces) are buried in the ground 6 cm in order.\nObservation items include: air temperature and humidity (Ta_5m, RH_5m, Ta_10m, RH_10m) (unit: centigrade, percentage), air pressure (Press) (unit: hectopascal), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), wind speed (WS_5m, WS_10m) (unit: m / s), wind direction (WD_10m) (unit: degree), four-component radiation (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts / square meter), surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2 ) (unit: centigrade), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watts/square meter), soil moisture (Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm, Ms_10cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_40cm, Ms_60cm, Ms_100cm) (unit: volumetric water content, percentage) and soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_40cm, Ts_60cm, Ts_100cm) (unit: centigrade).\nProcessing and quality control of the observation data: (1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10 minutes), when there is missing data, it is marked by -6999; From March 19, 2015 to March 26, due to the collector problem, the data is missing; (2) eliminate the moment with duplicate records; (3) delete the data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument; (5) the format of date and time is uniform, and the date and time are in the same column. For example, the time is: 2015-6-10 10:30; (6) the naming rules are: AWS+ site name. The station was dismantled after April 12.\nFor hydrometeorological network or site information, please refer to Li et al. (2013). For observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2011).",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

A Fluke Ti55 thermal infrared camera was manually operated on a 25-m-high platform on a boundary layer tower to measure the thermal radiation of the cropland approximately every 120 min; the observations were collected as thermal images from approximately 07:00 to 19:00 China Standard Time (CST) during the daytime.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.

                    "Answer": "One significant factor is the complexity of the surface, which contains a mixture of soil and vegetation with different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. This heterogeneity makes it difficult for one-source models to estimate surface evapotranspiration accurately. Errors in determining surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from remote sensing data, particularly due to image classification errors and atmospheric effects, also contribute to these challenges.",

These classification errors can lead to misclassification of soil and vegetation pixels, resulting in overestimated canopy temperatures. Additionally, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance can introduce uncertainties in estimated temperatures, further limiting the approach.",
