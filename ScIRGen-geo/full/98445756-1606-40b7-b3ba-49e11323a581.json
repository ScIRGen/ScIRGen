            "description": "This data set includes the thermal chronological data of the South Tianshan Mountains and the piedmont, and the U-Pb chronological data of sedimentary detrital zircons. These data are of great significance for establishing the Cenozoic uplift and expansion process of the South Tianshan Mountains, the basin mountain coupling evolution of the South Tianshan Mountains and the northern margin of the Tarim Basin, and its dynamic mechanism. Among them, thermochronological data mainly includes apatite fission track data of bedrock and clastic rocks. The external detector method is used for testing, and the accuracy of the data is mostly less than 15% (1 sigma), with a small amount of data less than 40% (1 sigma); The U-Pb geochronological data of detrital zircons were tested using LA-ICP-MS with an accuracy of less than 5% (1 sigma). The fission track data of apatite is presented in the form of a result table, and the U-Pb dating data of detrital zircon includes the original test data, which can be further analyzed. These data are of great significance for establishing the Cenozoic uplift and expansion process of the South Tianshan Mountains, the basin mountain coupling evolution of the South Tianshan Mountains and the northern margin of the Tarim Basin, and its dynamic mechanism.",
