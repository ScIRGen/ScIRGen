            "description": "This data set includes cathodoluminescence images (CL images) of detrital zircons from sandstone of Late Carboniferous-Late Permian strata in the Southern Qiangtang terrane and Early Cretaceous Hauterivian-Albian strata in the Bangong‐Nujiang suture zone, Tibetan Plateau. The sampling and shooting time is 2018-2019. The sampling areas of Late Carboniferous-Late Permian strata are Jiaco and Ritu areas of the Southern Qiangtang terrane. The sampling areas of Early Cretaceous Hauterivian-Albian strata are Baerqiao, Mabujiaco, Duochang and Kama areas of the Bangong‐Nujiang suture zone. CL images were taken in the Continental Dynamics Laboratory, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing, China These data provide a key limit for understanding the closing of the Bangong‐Nujiang suture zone. The opening time of Bangong‐Nujiang Ocean is limited to 300-279Ma, and the closing time is limited to 110-100 Ma, which is of great significance to explore the tectonic evolution of Tethys Ocean. The related articles of the data set have been published in the well-known journals《Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology》,《Tectonics》,《Geoscience Frontiers》, and the data results are true and reliable.",
