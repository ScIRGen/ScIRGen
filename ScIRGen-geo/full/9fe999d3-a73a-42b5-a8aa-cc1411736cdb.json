            "description": "The data set includes the identification results of animal remains, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of animal bone collagen and dating data of Han Dynasty tombs in the country of Heishui. Animal bones were collected during the excavation of Han tombs in the State of Heishui, and animal archaeological analysis, C and N stable isotope analysis and dating were carried out in the Key Laboratory of Western Environment of the Ministry of Education, Lanzhou University. The collected animal bones were classified, identified and measured according to their morphological characteristics. Animal bones were treated with acid-alkali-acid to extract animal bone collagen for C and N stable isotope analysis and dating. The analysis showed that humans mainly used domestic chickens, pigs and sheep as burial objects, with other burial objects including cattle, horses and dogs. In the Han Dynasty of the Black Water, humans probably fed more C4 food than herbivorous livestock. Through archaeological and isotopic studies of prehistoric animals in the Hexi Corridor, we found that herbivorous livestock were more important in animal utilization strategies than omnivorous livestock, and the weight of C4 foods in feed basically decreased during the period of about 2,300-200 BCE, which may be caused by long-distance exchange and climate fluctuations. However, the trend of the Hexi Corridor was reversed during the Han Dynasty, largely due to the control of the region by the Han Empire and the subsequent mass migration from the Yellow River basin in northern China.",

                    "Answer": "The analysis of animal bone collagen C, N stable isotopes and dating data suggests that during the Han dynasty in the Heishuiguo region, humans primarily used domesticated animals like chickens, pigs, and sheep as burial offerings, with other animals like cattle, horses, and dogs also included. The data indicates that humans possibly fed their livestock more C4 plants compared to the herbivores. Additionally, the importance of herbivorous livestock in animal utilization strategies over omnivorous livestock was significant, and the weight of C4 plants in feed decreased between approximately 2300-200 BCE, likely due to long-distance exchanges and climate fluctuations. However, this trend reversed during the Han dynasty, attributed to the Han empire's control over the region and the subsequent large-scale migration from the northern Yellow River basin of China.",

                    "Answer": "The use of C and N stable isotope analysis and radiocarbon dating in analyzing animal bones from Han tombs could be influenced by the need to understand dietary patterns, the types of animals used as burial offerings, and the temporal context of animal usage. These methods provide insights into the types of food consumed, the feeding strategies of livestock, and the historical timeline of these practices, which are essential for reconstructing ancient human-animal interactions and economic strategies in the region.",

                    "Answer": "Using stable isotope analysis and radiocarbon dating on animal bone collagen can reveal dietary patterns and the types of animals used as burial offerings, indicating cultural practices and shifts in human-animal relationships. In the Han Dynasty’s Heishui Kingdom, such methods showed a preference for domestic fowl, pigs, and sheep as grave goods, and indicated a change in feeding practices of livestock, suggesting shifts in agricultural strategies due to climate fluctuations and trade exchanges.",

This research aims to provide insights into the cultural and environmental influences on the Heishui Kingdom's burial practices during the Han dynasty, as well as the impact of long-distance exchange, climate fluctuation, and Han Empire's control on regional resource utilization.",
