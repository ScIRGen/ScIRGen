            "description": "This dataset contains the data of the meteorological element gradient observation system of the Sidaoqiao superstation downstream of the Heihe Hydrometeorological Observation Network from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The site is located in Sidaoqiao, Dalaihu Town, Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia. The underlying surface is Tamarix. The latitude and longitude of the observation point is 101.1374E, 42.0012N, and the altitude is 873m. The air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed sensors are respectively set at 5m, 7m, 10m, 15m, 20m and 28m, with 6 layers facing the north; the wind direction sensor is set at 15m, facing the north; the barometer is installed in the waterproof box. The tipping bucket rain gauge is installed at 28m; the four-component radiometer is installed at 10m, facing south; two infrared thermometers are installed at 10m, facing south, the probe orientation is vertically downward; two photosynthetically active radiometers are installed At 10m, facing south, and the probe is vertically upward and downward respectively; the soil moisture sensor is installed 2m on the south side of the tower body, and the soil heat flow plates (self-correcting type) (3 pieces) are buried in turn in the ground 6cm deep; The average soil temperature sensor TCAV is buried in the ground 2cm, 4cm; the soil temperature probe is buried in the ground surface 0cm and underground 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm; soil moisture sensors are buried in the underground 2cm, 4cm, 10cm, 20cm, 40cm, 80cm, 120cm and 160cm.\nObserved items include: wind speed (WS_5m, WS_7m, WS_10m, WS_15m, WS_20m, WS_28m) (unit: m/s), wind direction (WD_15m) (unit: degree), air temperature and humidity (Ta_5m, Ta_7m, Ta_10m, Ta_15m, Ta_20m, Ta_28m and RH_5m, RH_7m, RH_10m, RH_15m, RH_20m, RH_28m) (unit: centigrade, percentage), pressure (unit: hectopascal), precipitation (Rain) (unit: mm), four-component radiation (DR, UR, DLR_Cor, ULR_Cor, Rn) (unit: watts/square meter), surface radiation temperature (IRT_1, IRT_2) (unit: centigrade), up and down photosynthetically active radiation (PAR_U_up, PAR_U_down) (unit: micromol/square Msec), average soil temperature (TCAV) (unit: centigrade), soil heat flux (Gs_1, Gs_2, Gs_3) (unit: watts/square meter), soil moisture (Ms_2cm, Ms_4cm, Ms_10cm, Ms_20cm, Ms_40cm, Ms_80cm) , Ms_120cm, Ms_160cm) (unit: volumetric water content, percentage), soil temperature (Ts_0cm, Ts_2cm, Ts_4cm, Ts_10cm, Ts_20cm, Ts_40cm, Ts_80cm, Ts_120cm, Ts_160cm) (unit: centigrade).\nProcessing and quality control of the observation data: (1) ensure 144 data per day (every 10 minutes), when there is missing data, it is marked by -6999; From September 8, 2014 to November 8, due to the sensor problems, the data is missing; on May 9, 2014, the soil moisture probe was re-buried, and the data before and after is inconsistent; (2) eliminate the moment with duplicate records; (3) delete the data that is obviously beyond the physical meaning or the range of the instrument; (5) the format of date and time is uniform, and the date and time are in the same column. For example, the time is: 2014-9-10 10:30; (6) the naming rules are: AWS+ site name.\nFor hydrometeorological network or site information, please refer to Li et al. (2013). For observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al. (2011).",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."
