            "description": "This dataset contains the glacier outlines in Qilian Mountain Area in 2019. The dataset was produced based on classical band ratio criterion and manual editing. Chinese GF series images collected in 2019 were used as basic data for glacier extraction. Google images and Map World images were employed as reference data for manual adjusting. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates, glacier ID and glacier area. Consisting of 1 season, the dataset has a spatial resolution of 2 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±2 meter). The dataset directly reflects the glacier distribution within the Qilian Mountain in 2018, and can be used for quantitative estimation of glacier mass balance and the quantitative assessment of glacier change’s impact on basin runoff.",

It involves using ratios of different spectral bands from satellite imagery to identify and delineate features such as glaciers. In this context, it is used to extract glacier distribution from high-resolution satellite images, which are then manually corrected to improve accuracy.",

The original data comes from high-resolution satellite imagery covering the entire Qilian Mountains in 2019. Reference images from Google and Tianditu are also utilized.
