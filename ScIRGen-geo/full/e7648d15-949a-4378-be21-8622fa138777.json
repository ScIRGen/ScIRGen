            "description": "This data set contains the eddy correlativity observation data of the naked earth station downstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014.The station is located in Inner Mongolia ejin banner four bridge, the underlying surface is bare ground.The longitude and latitude of the observation point are 101.1326e, 41.9993n and 878m above sea level.The rack height of the vortex correlativity meter is 3.5m, the sampling frequency is 10Hz, the ultrasonic orientation is due north, and the distance between the ultrasonic wind speed and temperature meter (CSAT3) and CO2/H2O analyzer (Li7500) is 15cm.\nThe original observation data of the vortex correlativity instrument is 10Hz, and the published data is the 30-minute data processed by Eddypro software. The main processing steps include: outliers, delay time correction, coordinate rotation (quadratic coordinate rotation), frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction and density (WPL) correction.Quality assessment for each intercompared to at the same time, mainly is the atmospheric stability (Δ st) and turbulent characteristics of similarity (ITC) test.The 30min pass value output by Eddypro software was also screened :(1) data when instrument error was eliminated;(2) data of 1h before and after precipitation are excluded;(3) remove the data with a missing rate of more than 10% in the original 10Hz data within every 30 minutes;(4) the observation data of weak turbulence at night (u* less than 0.1m/s) were excluded.The average observation period was 30 minutes, 48 data per day, and the missing data was marked as -6999.Suspicious data caused by instrument drift, etc., shall be marked in red font.\nThe published observational data include:Date/Time for the Date/Time, wind Wdir (°), Wnd horizontal wind speed (m/s), standard deviation Std_Uy lateral wind speed (m/s), ultrasonic virtual temperature Tv (℃), the water vapor density H2O (g/m3), carbon dioxide concentration CO2 (mg/m3), friction velocity Ustar) (m/s), stability Z/L (dimensionless), sensible heat flux Hs (W/m2), latent heat flux LE (W/m2), carbon dioxide flux Fc (mg/(m2s)), the quality of the sensible heat flux identifier QA_Hs, the quality of the latent heat flux identifier QA_LE,Quality indicator for co2 flux QA_Fc.The quality of the sensible heat and latent heat, carbon dioxide flux identification is divided into three (quality id 0: (Δ st < 30, the ITC < 30);1: (Δ st < 100, ITC < 100);The rest is 2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average of 0:00-0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nFor information of hydrometeorological network or station, please refer to Li et al.(2013), and for observation data processing, please refer to Liu et al.(2011).",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times.
