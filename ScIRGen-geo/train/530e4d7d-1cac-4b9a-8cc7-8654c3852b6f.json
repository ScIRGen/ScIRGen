            "description": "In recent years, rare metals have attracted much attention at home and abroad because of their importance and strategic significance. Niobium and tantalum, as important rare resources, have many mineralization events in South China. From 2020 to 2021, a large granite porphyry tantalum niobium deposit recently discovered in Daping, Yongding, Fujian Province was selected as the research object, and LA-ICP-MS was used to study the U-Pb geochronology of tantalum niobium minerals. The U-Pb isotopic dating data of tantalum and niobium minerals were obtained by LA-ICP-MS analysis, and the major elements of tantalum and niobium minerals were obtained by EMPA analysis. It provides a basis for determining the metallogenic age and type of the deposit. The results show that the metallogenic age of Daping TA NB deposit is about 183 Ma, which is consistent with the diagenetic age within the error range, indicating that there is an early Jurassic granite porphyry TA NB metallogenic event in South China. In addition, the Daping early Jurassic granite porphyry type TA NB deposit is an important supplement to the study of TA NB mineralization in South China in terms of metallogenic time and type, and provides a new idea for TA NB prospecting in South China in the future.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of determining the age of tantalum-niobium deposits, 'U-Pb isotopic dating using LA-ICP-MS' refers to a data collection method where a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) technique is used to analyze the uranium-lead isotopic composition of minerals. This method allows researchers to establish the precise age of mineralization events, helping to identify the timing of ore formation. In the case of the 福建闽西南大坪花岗斑岩型钽铌矿, this technique was used to determine the mineralization age to be approximately 183 Ma, which aligns with the igneous formation age, suggesting a Jurassic period metallogenic event in South China.",
