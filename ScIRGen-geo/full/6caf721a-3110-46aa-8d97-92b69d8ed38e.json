            "description": "The routine meteorological observation data set of four times a day provided by the data management center of Heihe plan is adopted, including 13 stations. The daily evaporation was statistically sorted out, and the monthly evaporation data of 2000-2009 years was calculated. The spatial stability analysis is carried out to calculate the coefficient of variation. If the coefficient of variation is greater than 100%, the geographical weighted regression is used to calculate the relationship between the station and the geographical terrain factors, and the monthly evaporation distribution trend is obtained; if the coefficient of variation is less than or equal to 100%, the common least square regression is used to calculate the relationship between the station evaporation value and the geographical terrain factors (latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, aspect, etc.) After the trend is removed, the residuals are fitted and corrected by HASM (high accuracy surface modeling method). Finally, the monthly average evaporation distribution of the Heihe River Basin in 1961-2010 is obtained by adding the trend surface results and the residual correction results. Time resolution: monthly average evaporation in 2000-2009. Spatial resolution: 500M.",

Alternatively, if the variability is lower or equal to 100%, ordinary least squares regression is utilized, potentially affecting the spatial distribution accuracy by offering a different perspective on the relationship between evaporation values and geographic factors. This methodological choice impacts the precision and reliability of the spatial representation of evaporation data.",

This approach helps in calculating the monthly evaporation distribution trend by determining whether spatial variations are significant (with a variance coefficient greater than 100%) or not. This process ensures that the data accurately reflects the spatial distribution of evaporation across different geographic conditions.",

Spatial stability is analyzed by calculating the coefficient of variation. If the coefficient is greater than 100%, a geographically weighted regression is used to model the relationship between station data and geographic-terrain factors. If the coefficient is less than or equal to 100%, ordinary least squares regression is used for this purpose. High Accuracy Surface Modeling Method (HASM) is applied to the residuals to correct and fit them. The resulting trend surface and residual corrections are combined to produce the multi-year average monthly evaporation distribution for the period 1961-2010, with a spatial resolution of 500 meters.",
