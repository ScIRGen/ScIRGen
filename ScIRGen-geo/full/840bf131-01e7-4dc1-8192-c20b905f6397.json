            "titleEn": "Sulfur and lead isotopic data of pyrite and chalcopyrite in Hengdong cobalt deposit, Northeastern Hunan",
            "description": "The dataset includes sulfur and lead isotope data of pyrite and chalcopyrite in Hengdong cobalt deposit, Hunan Province. The experimental method is as follows: the pure separation is crushed into small pieces and grinded into powder with a diameter of 0.5-2 mm by a stone mill for s and Pb isotope analysis. The prepared sulfide separation solution leached soluble sulfate in 10% NaCl solution, rinsed three times in deionized water, and then dissolved in 3 N HCl. The acidified sample was filtered and an excess of 1 m BaCl2 was added to the filtrate to precipitate BaSO4. 0.1 mg BaSO4 precipitate was accurately weighed, rinsed, filtered and dried, and then mixed with excessive V2O5. The S isotopic composition of the precipitate was analyzed at the State Key Laboratory of biological geology and environmental geology, Wuhan Branch of China University of Geosciences. The sulfur isotope composition is based on the standard δ  Symbolic representation, using the traditional Delta（ δ The symbol 34S represents the change per thousand (%) relative to the v-cdt. According to the repeated analysis of samples and the calculation of laboratory standards NBS 127 (21.1%), IAEA SO-5 (0.49%) and IAEA SO-6 (- 34.05%), the analysis error of sulfur isotope results is about 0.1%. Lead isotope analysis of four pyrite isolates was monitored by standard nbs981 at the analytical laboratory of Beijing Institute of uranium geology using GV isoprobe-t thermal ionization mass spectrometer. The analytical procedure consists of dissolving the sample in a crucible with HF and HClO4, and then purifying the lead with an alkaline anion exchange resin. The result of standard nbs981 is 206Pb / 204Pb = 16.937 ±  0.002 (2 σ)、 207Pb/204 Pb = 15.457  ±  0.002 (2 σ)  And 208Pb / 204Pb = 36.01 ± 4 (2 σ)。 The data can be used for geochemical analysis of Hengdong cobalt deposit in Hunan and similar deposits in Northeast Hunan.\nThe above data have been published in SCI high-level journals, and the data are true and reliable.

Sulfur isotopes are determined by leaching soluble sulfates from prepared sulfide isolates in a NaCl solution, followed by dissolution in HCl, precipitation with BaCl2, and analysis of the BaSO4 precipitate mixed with V2O5 using a mass spectrometer. Lead isotopes are analyzed by dissolving samples in HF and HClO4, purifying lead using ion exchange resin, and measuring isotopic ratios with a thermal ionization mass spectrometer.",

The lead isotope analysis uses thermal ionization mass spectrometry, with sample dissolution in HF and HClO4, and purification using anion exchange resin. The precision for sulfur isotope results is about 0.1%, while lead isotope results are monitored using standard NBS981. These methods emphasize accuracy in isotopic composition and require specific sample preparation steps, including purification and use of standard references, which may differ from other isotope analysis methods that might use different standards or sample preparation techniques.",
