            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with the airborne microwave radiometers (L&K bands, between 8:06~11:17BJT) and thermal imager mission (between 12:48~16:35BJT) was obtained in  L2, L3, L4, L5 and L6 of the A'rou foci experimental area on Apr. 1, 2008. The samples were collected every 100m along the strip from south to north in the the morning and from north to south in the afternoon.\n     In L2, L4 and L6, the soil temperature, soil volumetric moisture, the loss tangent, soil conductivity, and the real part and the imaginary part of soil complex permittivity were acquired by the POGO soil sensor, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the surface radiative temperature measured three times by the hand-held infrared thermometer, and soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3).\n     In L3, soil volumetric moisture was acquired by ML2X, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the surface radiative temperature measured three times by the hand-held infrared thermometer, and soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3).\n     In L5, soil volumetric moisture, soil conductivity, the soil temperature, and the real part of soil complex permittivity were acquired by WET, the mean soil temperature from 0-5cm by the probe thermometer, the surface radiative temperature measured three times by the hand-held infrared thermometer, soil gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture, and soil bulk density after drying by the cutting ring (100cm^3). \n     Besides, the handheld thermal imager observations were carried out in L4. Those provide reliable ground data for retrieval and validation of soil moisture and freeze/thaw status from active remote sensing approaches. \n     Seven files were included, two ground-based microwave radiometers (L&K-band and L-band) observations, L2 data, L3 data, L4 data, L5 data and L6 data.",

                    "Answer": "To ensure accurate synchronization, airborne microwave radiometer measurements were taken during specific flights targeting frozen and thawed soil conditions. Ground-based observations were conducted simultaneously along multiple sample transects, with precise timing and direction of data collection. For frozen soil, morning flights were conducted using L&K band airborne microwave radiometers, while for thawed soil, midday flights used L band radiometers and thermal imagers. Ground-based observations included portable soil moisture sensors, needle thermometers, handheld infrared thermometers, and soil sampling for drying and weighing. This synchronized approach allows for comprehensive and accurate data collection to support remote sensing inversion algorithms.",

                    "Answer": "The effective collection of soil moisture and temperature data in remote sensing experiments is enabled by the use of sensors such as the POGO portable soil moisture sensor, ML2X soil moisture rapid tester, and WET soil moisture tester. These instruments measure soil temperature, volumetric water content, dielectric properties, and electrical conductivity. Additionally, portable infrared thermometers and needle thermometers are used for measuring surface and soil temperature. The data is further supported by traditional soil sampling methods like using a 100cm^3 ring cutter for soil moisture content determination.",
