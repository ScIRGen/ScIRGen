            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the Huailai station eddy covariance system (EC) from January 1 to December 31 in 2018. The site (115.7880° E, 40.3491° N) was located in the maize surface, near Donghuayuan town of Huailai city in Hebei Province. The elevation is 480 m. The EC was installed at a height of 5 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500A) was 0.15 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1 (level 0: Δst<30 and ITC<30), class 2 (level 1: Δst<100 and ITC<100), and class 3 (level 2: Δst>100 and ITC>100), which represent high-, medium-, and low-quality data, respectively. In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. \nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Guo et al. (2020) (for sites information), Liu et al.

                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance technique is a data collection method used to measure and calculate vertical turbulent fluxes within the atmosphere. It involves using instruments like sonic anemometers and gas analyzers to capture high-frequency (e.g., 10Hz) data on wind speed and gas concentrations, which are later processed to derive fluxes such as heat, water vapor, and CO2. This processed data typically results in averaged metrics over a specific time period, like 30 minutes, after undergoing steps like coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and quality assessment.",

                    "Answer": "Data gaps or errors can occur due to several factors, including instrument malfunction, which led to data loss from June 17 to June 28 and September 30 to October 20. Additionally, errors may arise from environmental conditions such as precipitation, which prompted the removal of data recorded 1 hour before and after rainfall events. Other causes include high rates of missing data in raw 10Hz recordings and low turbulence conditions at night, where friction velocity (u*) is less than 0.1m/s. The dataset adheres to strict quality control measures, removing data during instrument errors, high missing data rates, and low turbulence to ensure reliability.",

                    "Answer": "Using Eddypro software to process 10Hz raw data into 30-minute intervals can improve data quality and accuracy by applying steps such as outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, sonic temperature correction, and density correction. These steps can help ensure that the processed data accurately reflects atmospheric conditions. However, challenges such as instrument errors, data loss during precipitation events, and weak nocturnal turbulence might still affect the data quality. Therefore, quality assessments based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics are crucial to ensure the reliability of the collected data.",

This processing aims to ensure high-quality and reliable flux measurements by addressing atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics, as well as filtering out erroneous and low-turbulence data.",

The flux values undergo quality evaluation primarily through atmospheric stability (Δst) and turbulence similarity characteristics (ITC) testing. The data are further filtered to remove records during instrument errors, one hour before and after precipitation, instances where more than 10% of the 10Hz original data is missing within 30 minutes, and observations of weak nighttime turbulence (u* less than 0.1m/s).",
