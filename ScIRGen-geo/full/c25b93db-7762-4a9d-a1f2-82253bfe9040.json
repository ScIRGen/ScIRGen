            "description": "This dataset includes two reference images. The first one is before the calibration and validation experiment and the second one is during the calibration and validation experiment. The first image was shoot and mosaicked by CCD camera on 8 November, 2011. It was mainly used to design the experiment in the middle stream. The spatial resolution is 0.3 m for raw image and 0.5 m for the mosaicked image. The second reference image is CASI image shoot on 29 June, 2012. This image is mainly used to crop structure mapping in the experiment area. The spatial resolution is 0.3 m for raw image and 0.5 m for the mosaicked image.\nData format：GeoTIFF\nProjection：The 2000 national geodetic coordinate system",

These images are primarily used for designing observation system layouts in the midstream flux observation matrix core experiment area. In contrast, CASI data, also with an original resolution of 0.3m and mosaicked to 0.5m, support analysis and classification of planting structures in the same region.

This process was conducted with imaging from November 8, 2011, to aid in the design of the observation system layout for the core test area of the midstream flux observation matrix. The original resolution of the data is 0.3m, and the mosaicked image resolution is 0.5m.",
