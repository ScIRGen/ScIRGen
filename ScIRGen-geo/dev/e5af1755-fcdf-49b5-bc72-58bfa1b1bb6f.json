            "description": "Net Primary Productivity (NPP) refers to the total amount of organic matter produced by photosynthesis in green plants per unit time and area. As the basis of water cycle, nutrient cycle and biodiversity change in terrestrial ecosystems, NPP is an important ecological indicator for estimating earth support capacity and evaluating sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems. This data set includes the monthly synthesis of 30m*30m surface LAI products in Qilian mountain area in 2021. Max value composition (MVC) method was used to synthesize monthly NPP products on the surface using the reflectivity data of Landsat 8 and sentinel 2 channels from Red and NIR channels.",

This approach provides detailed spatial resolution, which may offer advantages in capturing finer-scale ecological variations compared to some other satellite data sources that might offer lower resolution or less frequent temporal coverage. However, differences in spectral bands, revisit times, and cloud cover limitations can affect the accuracy and utility of different satellite sources for NPP estimation.",
