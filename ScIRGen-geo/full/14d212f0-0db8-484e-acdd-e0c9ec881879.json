            "description": "The dataset of diurnal FPAR change observations was obtained in the Yingke oasis foci experimental areas. Observation items included:\n     (1) Maize canopy reflectance spectra by ASD and 50% grey board, leaf SPAD by the chlorophyll meter and leaf photosynthesis by LI-6400 in Yingke oasis maize field on Jul. 5, 2008 (fixed point observations from 10:00-20:00 at intervals of one hour, and half an hour from 16:00)\n     Besides,  Photo: photosynthetic rate (µmol CO2 m-2 s-1), Cond: stomatal conductance (mol H2O m-2 s-1),  Ci: intercellular CO2 viscosity (µmol CO2 mol-1),  Trmmol: transpiration rate (mmol H2O m-2 s-1), VpdL: vapor pressure deficiency of leaves (kPa), Tleaf: leaf temperature (°C),  ParIn_µm: active radiation of interior photosynthesis (µmol m-2 s-1),  and ParOutµm: active radiation of outdoor photosynthesis (µmol m-2 s-1) were all archived.\n     (2) Maize canopy reflectance spectra, leaf photosynthesis and diurnal FPAR change by ASD (Institute of Remote Sensing Applications), 50% grey board (Institute of Remote Sensing Applications), LI-6400 (Institute of Remote Sensing Applications) and SUNSCAN (Beijing academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences). \n     Based on calibration lamp data (serial number: 64831), radiance spectrum on Jul. 9 by 1050 spectrometer (Beijing academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences) and 50% grey board and 99% white board calibration data, the spectrum data were preprocessed.\n     Calibration was undertaken in accordance with the following precedures:\n     a) The original DN was converted into radiance and further into readable EXCEL format by the spectrometer-matched calibration lamp data and ASD. \n     b) Solar radiance was got by 99% white board radiance. solar radiance=the reference board radiance/the reference board reflectance.\n     c) Spectrum from Agriculture and Forestry Sciences was sampled at an interval of 1.438nm, which was made into data at 1nm intervals by segmentation interpolation. \n     d) Based on b=16.087a (where a is radiance before fitting and b after fitting), radiance data got by 68731 spectrograph were processed.\n     The original maize leaf photosynthesis data (by LI-6400) were introduced into EXCEL format, diurnal changes of each leaf were archived as one single unit according to leaf classification. \n     Maize FPAR (the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation) was got by FPAR= (canopyPAR－surface transmissionPAR－canopy reflection PAR+surface reflectionPAR) /canopy PAR; APAR= FPAR×canopy PAR. The unit for PAR  was µmol m-2 s-1. The data included number (the whole leaf), observation time (hh:mm:ss), upper light (µmol m-2 s-1), upper reflectivity (µmol m-2 s-1), lower light (µmol m-2 s-1), lower reflectivity (µmol m-2 s-1) and Spread: variation coefficients of the probe optical intensity.",

                "Gross primary production (GPP) is defined as the overall rate of fixation of carbon through the process of vegetation photosynthesis. It is used to quantify the amount of biomass produced within an ecosystem over a unit of time, regardless of the amount of respiration. The seasonal difference of GPP and ecosystem respiration (Re) determines the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between the atmosphere and forest ecosystems and is important for understanding global carbon cycle climate change research. The eddy covariance (EC) technique is one of the best micrometeorological methods for the estimation of CO2, water, and energy exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing provides consistent and systematic land surface observations and has played an increasing role in characterizing vegetation structure and estimating GPP. The fundamental methodology of GPP estimation is based on Monteith’s equation: GPP ¼ LUE /C2 fAPAR /C2 PAR, where LUE is the light use efficiency, often in units of mol CO2 per mol photosynthetic photon flux density (mol CO2 mol−1 PPFD), and fAPAR represents the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Many models and methods using the LUE basis have been proposed for GPP estimation from ground measurements and satellite remote sensing data."

On the basis of previous research, we selected some VIs that were proved to have the potential to estimate LUE (mol CO2 mol−1 PPFD) and fAPAR and proposed a method to estimate GPP (mg CO2 m−2 s−1) with the MODIS data. The study should be helpful for future GPP models driven by all remote‐sensing inputs."

            "challenges": [

The limitation of LUE models, however, is that they require meteorological inputs that are often not available at sufficiently detailed temporal and spatial scales, resulting in substantial errors in the outputs. Estimates of daytime Re from the nighttime RE‐T relation are associated with considerable uncertainties such as the overestimation of daytime respiration due to the extrapolation of nighttime respiration fluxes."

To form a suite of data, the product (MOD 09, 500 m) of the Terra MODIS surface‐reflectance atmospheric correction algorithm from 13 June to 10 July 2008 was downloaded to estimate the midday GPP at the satellite overpass time.
