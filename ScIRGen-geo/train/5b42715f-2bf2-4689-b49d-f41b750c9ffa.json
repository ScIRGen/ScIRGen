            "description": "This dataset contains 10 meters by the wind speed, 10 meters zonal wind speed, atmospheric temperature, dew point temperature, 10 meters mean sea level, surface pressure, the average wave to the peak, the average wave period, wave period, sea surface temperatures, wind wave and swell with the significant wave height, total precipitation, and model bathymetry, a total of 13 variables. This dataset is from the European center for medium-range weather forecasts (ECMWF) issued by the fifth generation of the global atmospheric ERA5 reanalysis dataset. ERA5 is a global atmospheric reanalysis, from 1959 to five days before the real-time, it is a blend of as much as possible of high altitude and near-surface observation, combined with the atmospheric model, model of the land surface, and the wave model. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread. ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month). In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.",

                "A precise knowledge and proper understanding of long–term pattern and climatological analysis of ocean wave on regional and local scales plays an exigent role in various applications, such as coastal and ocean engineering, physical oceanography, climate projection, marine weather forecasting, coastal morphodynamics, sustainable coastal zone management, shipping routes, marine exploitation, marine industry, development of marine environment, and the planning of marine operations and the marine industry. Information on ocean surface waves is necessary for naval operation or warfare, rescue operations, optimum tracking of ship routes (OTSR), design and development of harbors, wave climate assessment and recreation. The investigation on wave climate is very applicable as a reference for the assessment of wave energy resource development. As change in wave climate is one of the most essential indictor of change in pattern of wind, sea surface temperature and pressure, investigation on long–term trend in wave climate has profound importance. Therefore, study on the long–term variability of wave parameters such wave height, square slope, and period is essential for such applications. Extreme ocean wave heights can provoke coastal sea level extremes and flooding, cause destruction to coastal structures and therefore, to reduce such risk, proper understanding of ocean wave height variability is must needed. Winds blowing over the sea surface generate surface waves playing an important role in the air–sea interaction process in a coupled ocean–atmosphere system and IPCC-AR5 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Fifth Assessment Report) emphasized the importance of wind-waves as they play a vital role in the transfer of energy across the air–sea interface. Long-term study and proper presentation of wave climate requires about 30 years of datasets and long-term data for wind and waves provide an opportunity to understand the inter-annual, intra-seasonal and decadal variability. Important ocean waves data such as significant height of combined wind waves and swell (SWH), mean period of combined wind waves and swell (Tm), mean square slope of waves (MSS), coefficient of drag with waves (Cd), and ocean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind speed (WSP) are investigated in this study. Cd is a type of counteraction due to the atmospheric exertion of waves where MSS and standard slope of combined wind and swell waves are connected to each other. MSS and Cd are both dimensionless parameters. BoB experience coexistence of wind seas and swells. Weather system of BoB is divided into three categories: a) fair weather or pre-monsoon period from February to May, b) southwest or summer monsoon period from June to September and northeast or post-monsoon period from October to January, where the sea-state or surface waves during the fair weather period is usually calm. Changes in wave height in the BoB arouse upgraded tropical cyclone activity in June, July and August during the Indian monsoon. BoB is more vulnerable to tropical cyclones, forming over the Bay with primary maximum in October, November and December and secondary maximum during April and May, can cause large inter-annual variations in wave parameters. BoB is an area of spatial variation in wave climate. Due to sheltering of Sri Lankan Island, surface waves in the southern BoB do not reach the major part of the southeast coast and the south-western BoB have low-wave height compared to the northern BoB."
