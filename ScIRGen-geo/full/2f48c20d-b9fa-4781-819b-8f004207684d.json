            "description": "Chinese Cryospheric Information System is a comprehensive information system for the management and analysis of Chinese Cryospheric data. The establishment of Chinese Cryospheric Information System is to meet the needs of earth system science, to provide parameters and validation data for the development of response and feedback model of frozen soil, glacier and snow cover to global change under GIS framework; on the other hand, it is to systemically sort out and rescue valuable cryospheric data, to provide a scientific, efficient and safe management and division for it Analysis tools.\nThe basic datasets of the  Tibet Plateau mainly takes the Tibetan Plateau as the research region, ranging from longitude 70 -- 105 ° east and latitude 20 -- 40 ° north, containing the following types of data:\n1. Cryosphere data. Includes:\nPermafrost type (Frozengd), (Fromap);\nSnow depth distribution (Snowdpt)\nQuatgla (Quatgla)\n2. Natural environment and resources. Includes:\nTerrain: elevation, elevation zoning, slope, slope direction (DEM);\nHydrology: surface water (Stram_line), (Lake);\nBasic geology: Quatgeo, Hydrogeo;\nSurface properties: Vegetat;\n4. Climate data: temperature, surface temperature, and precipitation.\n3. Socio-economic resources (Stations) : distribution of meteorological Stations on the Tibetan Plateau and it surrounding areas.\n4. Response model of plateau permafrost to global change (named \"Fgmodel\"): permafrost distribution data in 2009, 2049 and 2099 were projected.\n\nPlease refer to the following documents (in Chinese): \"Design of Chinese Cryospheric Information System.doc\", \"Datasheet of Chinese Cryospheric Information System.DOC\", \"Database of the Tibetan Plateau.DOC\" and \"Database of the Tibetan Plateau 2.DOC\".",
