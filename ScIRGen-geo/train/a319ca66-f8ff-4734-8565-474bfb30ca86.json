            "description": "The Tibetan Plateau, featuring the most extensive lake distribution in China, has seen rapid expansion of most its lakes. These lakes are important nodes for regional water and energy cycles, and highly sensitive to climate change. It is therefore imperative to unravel lake water storage changes under climate variation and change to improve the understanding of mechanisms of the interactions between regional hydrology and climate and their changes.  This developed data set provides water level, hypsometric curves, and lake storage changes for 52 large lakes across the TP from 2000 to 2017, comprising traditional altimetry water levels and a unique source of information termed as the optical water levels derived from tremendous amounts of Landsat archives using Google Earth Engine. Field experiments agree with the theoritical analysis that the uncertainty of optical water level is 0.1 - 0.2 m, comparable with that of altimetry water level. The uncertainty of altimetry water level is represented by the standard deviation of water levels obtained from effective footprints of the same cycle, which is included in the dataset. This dataset is applicable in water resource and security management, lake basin hydrological analysis, water balance analysis and the like. For instance, it has great potential in monitoring lake overflow flood.",
            "instructions": "This data set contains 52 time series of lake water level and lake storage change (52 text files), and one text file that stores hypsometric curves of all lakes. The format of the time series file name is \"XXXX_Lake_water_ level_storage_changes\", where XXXX represents the English name of the lake. It can be opened in Notepad. Besides the header file information, each time series file contains five columns of data, including data acquisition date, water level, water level uncertainty, lake storage change and data source. The header file contains the latitude and longitude of the lake and a detailed description of each column of data.",

                "The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as Asia’s water tower, is quite sensitive to climate change, which is reflected by changes in hydrologic state variables such as lake water storage. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), providing vital water resources for more than a billion population in Asia, is a sensitive region undergoing rapid climate change. There are more than 1200 alpine lakes larger than 1 km² on the TP, where glaciers and permafrost are also widely distributed. Lake storage changes that play an important role in the regional water balance can be derived from changes in lake water level and area. Lake water levels and areas are mostly derived from satellite remote sensing due to the scarcity of in situ data across the TP, where the harsh environment and complex terrain make in situ measurements difficult to perform and costly. Lake water levels can be monitored using satellite altimeters initially designed for sea surface topography or ice sheet/sea ice freeboard height measurements. Changes in lake area can be captured by optical or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from medium- or high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data, such as Landsat and Sentinel series. Automatic water extraction methods based on the water index and auto-thresholding are more efficient in dealing with a mass of remote sensing images."

Second, systematic biases between different altimetry data were removed by either comparing the mean water levels during the overlap period or comparing the two water level time series with lake shoreline positions, depending on the length of the overlap period. Third, with information on lake water levels and areas derived from altimetry data and optical remote sensing images, the hypsometric curve that describes the relationship between the lake water level and storage changes can be derived. Fourth, the integral of the hypsometric curve was performed to convert lake water levels into storage changes."
