            "description": "By archaeological investigation and excavation in Tibetan Plateau, we discovered 8 Paleolithic-Epipaleolithic sites, including Baishiya karst cave, Jiangjunfu site, Meilongdapu cave, Xiaqulong site and so on. In this dataset, there are some basic informations about these sites, such as location, longitude, latitude, altitude, material culture and so on. On this Basis, we identified and analysed stone artifacts, animal remains and plant fossil, and obtained a batch of dating data of uranium series, radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence. This dataset provide important basic data for understanding when and how prehistoric human lived in the Tibetan Plateau during the Paleolithic.",

                    "Answer": "Incorporating uranium series dating, carbon-14 dating, and optically stimulated luminescence dating techniques in data collection methods can significantly enhance the understanding of ancient human activities and subsistence patterns on the Tibetan Plateau by providing precise chronological frameworks. These dating techniques allow for accurate age determination of archaeological sites and artifacts, which helps in constructing a timeline of human occupation and adaptation strategies. This chronological precision can lead to insights into the development of cultural attributes, the evolution of tool types and materials, and the shifting patterns of animal and plant resource utilization by ancient populations in response to environmental changes.",

These remains are then identified and analyzed in the laboratory, resulting in data such as uranium-series dating, radiocarbon dating, optically stimulated luminescence dating, types of stone tools and materials, and skeletal unit distribution identification of animal remains.",

Scientific collection, identification, and laboratory analysis of lithic tools and faunal remains are used to obtain uranium series dating, carbon-14 dating, optically stimulated luminescence dating, analysis of lithic tool types and raw material types, and identification of animal bone distribution units. These methods provide data support for studying the activities and subsistence patterns of prehistoric humans in the region.",
