        "Glaciers have long been classified as “temperate” and “polar” glacier (Ahlmann, 1935) or “temperate”, “sub-continental” and “polar continental” glacier in terms of geophysical properties (Shi, 2005), a temperate glacier being one that is at the melting point throughout except for a thin surface layer subject to seasonal cooling. A temperate glacier reacts very sensitive to air temperature than a sub- and polar continental glacier. The thermodynamic state of a glacier ice is subject to both seasonal and long-term climatic changes (Zagorodnov et al., 2006) and strongly determines their behavior (Blatter, 1987). Generally, a glacier’s active-layer temperature (ALT) depends on air temperature, accumulation, firn density, solar radiation, clouds (long wave radiation), surface albedo, wind (speed and direction), melt water runoff, percolation and refreezing of melt water, ice flow, the surface net energy balance and other parameters (Salamatin, 2000; Paterson, 1994; Harrison, 1972). The glacier’s ALT studies at home and abroad began in 1930s (Nye, 1953), while the deep borehole temperature in the late 1950s (Budd et al., 1976). Since the 1970s, most research of borehole temperatures focused on the continental and polar glaciers, especially in Antarctica, Greenland, Alps, Rockies, Svalbard and Himalayas, etc. (Sobota, 2011; Han et al., 1995; Haeberli and Funk, 1991; Blatter and Kappenberger, 1988). Most researchers emphasize four different contents: (a) firn temperatures measured in shallow holes (Alean et al., 1983); (b) heat exchange and thermal conductivity in the active layer (Xie et al., 1998; Funk et al., 1994); (c) temperature gradients and heat fluxes at the glacier base (Wegmann et al., 1998; Oeschger et al., 1977); and (d) the relationship between air temperature and the active-layer temperature (Zagorodnov et al., 2006). There are also detailed studies of spatial distribution of borehole temperature, especially in ice cap and the tongue of glacier (Robin and De, 1995; Haeberli and Alean, 1985). However, as of now, relatively few studies concentrated on the thermal regime of temperate glaciers except for several glaciers in the earlier period (Li et al., 2007; Mikhalenko, 1997; Huang et al., 1982)."
      ],
      "research objective": [
        "In order to better understand ALT characteristics of a temperate glacier and its response to climate change, this paper used recent three borehole temperatures to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of ALTs and their relationships with air temperature and mass balance on the ablation zone of Baishui Glacier No. 1 (BSG1), southeastern Tibetan Plateau, and revealed their inter-decadal variation towards climate change by making use of ALT measured data and comparing with previous studies."
      ],
      "challenges": [
        "Due to many ice crevasses everywhere in summer and autumn and large solid precipitation in winter and spring, the temperature profiles are often either buried for several months or some thermistors are damaged, which brought greater difficulties and challenges for continuous boreholes temperature monitoring. However, automatic weather station (4 750 m a.s.l.) is completely buried by snowfall with about 2 500 mm, and all meteorological data cannot be gained during this period. At the same time, ice crevasse distributes all over glacier surface in the ablation period, while the borehole was buried by snow for several months in the accumulation period. Some heat-sensitive temperature probes are damaged seriously and data observation is delayed by these factors, resulting in the loss of some probes and data."
      ],
      "methods": [
        "In this paper, the data and information (ALT, meteorology, and mass balance) mainly come from historical document “Glaciers in Hengduan Mountain” recorded on July 11, 1982 (Pu, 1994) and the measured data from September, 2008 to August, 2010. In the study, the A, B and C borehole temperatures are monitored by temperature measurement system, which includes thermistors (heat-sensitive probes), wires and ammeter. All borehole thermistors are soldered to individual two-conductor cables and waterproofed by heat-shrink tubing. All thermistors were installed in the boreholes with a vertical spacing varying each 1 m using a heat-sensitive attached to a cable. The resistance was directly measured by Digital Multimeter True RMS189 Fluke Company produced in the United States. Finally, the measured resistance is converted to temperature by Steinhart-Hart equation. In September, 2009, an automatic weather station nearby the borehole C with an altitude of 4 750 m a.s.l. was installed."

      "findings": [
        "The results showed that the influence of air temperature on the active-layer ice temperature had a hysteresis characteristic on the upper of ablation zone and the lag period increased gradually with the altitude elevating. The decrease amplitude of ALT in the accumulation period was far below its increase magnitude in the ablation period. At the same time, the mean glacier ice temperatures at 10 m depth (T10) in A, B and C profile were obviously higher than most of glaciers previously studied. Measured data also showed that the mean ALT increased by 0.24 °C in 0.5–8.5 m depth of the C profile during 28 years from July 11, 1982 to July 10, 2009."

        "冰川长期以来被分类为“温带”冰川和“极地”冰川（Ahlmann，1935），或根据地球物理特性分为“温带”、“亚大陆”和“极地大陆”冰川，温带冰川是指在除薄表层（受季节性冷却影响）外，整个冰川都处于融化点的冰川。温带冰川对气温的反应比亚大陆和极地大陆冰川更为敏感。冰川冰的热力学状态受季节性和长期气候变化的影响（Zagorodnov等，2006），并强烈决定其行为（Blatter，1987）。一般来说，冰川的活层温度（ALT）取决于气温、积累、雪密度、太阳辐射、云层（长波辐射）、表面反照率、风（速度和方向）、融水径流、融水的渗透和再冻结、冰流、表面净能量平衡及其他参数（Salamatin，2000；Paterson，1994；Harrison，1972）。国内外对冰川ALT的研究始于1930年代（Nye，1953），而深钻孔温度的研究则始于1950年代末（Budd等，1976）。自1970年代以来，大多数钻孔温度的研究集中在大陆和极地冰川，特别是在南极、格林兰、阿尔卑斯山、落基山脉、斯瓦尔巴群岛和喜马拉雅山等地（Sobota，2011；Han等，1995；Haeberli和Funk，1991；Blatter和Kappenberger，1988）。大多数研究者强调四个不同的内容：（a）在浅孔中测量的雪密度温度（Alean等，1983）；（b）活层的热交换和热导率（Xie等，1998；Funk等，1994）；（c）冰川底部的温度梯度和热流（Wegmann等，1998；Oeschger等，1977）；（d）气温与活层温度之间的关系（Zagorodnov等，2006）。还有关于钻孔温度空间分布的详细研究，特别是在冰盖和冰川舌头区域（Robin和De，1995；Haeberli和Alean，1985）。然而，迄今为止，关于温带冰川热力学状态的研究相对较少，除了早期对几个冰川的研究（Li等，2007；Mikhalenko，1997；Huang等，1982）。"
