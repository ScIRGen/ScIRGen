            "description": "This dataset includes radiocarbon dating data and carbon identification data for seven ancient cities in the middle and lower reaches of the Heihe River Basin during AD 240-1380. After pre-treatment, the graphite was prepared by AGE3 system, and the carbon dating was tested by accelerator mass spectrometer. Charcoal analysis was observed under metallographic microscope. The dating data were calibrated by Oxcal v.4.2 software and Incal13 curve. The number percentage and excavation probability of different species were calculated after identification of charcoal remains. The results show that many of the cities are younger than previously estimated, and that humans in the middle and lower reaches of the Black River Basin mainly used tamarix and tamarix mixed with broad-leaved trees between AD 240 and 1380, respectively, roughly consistent with the spatial distribution of modern natural woody vegetation in the region. Comparing the archaeological, paleoclimatic and historical results of the Hexi Corridor, we believe that the timber utilization strategy and its impact on the environment of the ancient people in the Heihe River Basin are mainly related to the human lifestyle, rather than climate change.",

                    "Answer": "In the context of ancient city studies in the Heihe River Basin during AD 240-1380, 'radiocarbon dating data and charcoal identification data' refer to the collection of chronological information and botanical analysis from carbon samples derived from archaeological sites. Radiocarbon dating involves measuring the age of carbon samples after pre-treatment and converting them into graphite using an AGE3 system, followed by carbon-14 age testing with an accelerator mass spectrometer. Charcoal identification data involves examining charcoal samples under a metallographic microscope to determine the species composition. The dating results are calibrated using Oxcal v.4.2 software with the Incal13 curve. The species identification results are used to calculate the percentage and probability of different species found, helping to understand the historical use of wood and its correlation with the local vegetation.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection method using accelerator mass spectrometry offers a high level of precision and reliability for radiocarbon dating, particularly useful for analyzing samples from ancient city sites. It requires smaller samples and provides more accurate age estimates than traditional methods, which might be subject to greater error margins and require larger sample sizes.",

                    "Answer": "The necessity of using radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification arises from the need to accurately determine the age of ancient cities, which may be younger than previously estimated. This approach helps to align the understanding of human activity and environmental interaction with the spatial distribution of modern woody vegetation in the region, independent of climate change influences.",

                    "Answer": "The use of radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification data reveals that many ancient cities are younger than previously estimated. It also shows that human populations during AD 240-1380 primarily utilized tamarisk and a mix of tamarisk and broad-leaved trees, reflecting the spatial distribution of modern natural woody vegetation in the region. The findings indicate that the strategies for wood utilization and the environmental impacts of ancient humans in the Heihe River Basin were closely related to human lifestyles rather than climate change.",
