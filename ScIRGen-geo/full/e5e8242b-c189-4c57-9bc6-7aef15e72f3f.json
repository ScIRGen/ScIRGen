            "description": "As one of the first batch and largest national parks in China, Sanjiangyuan National Park quantitatively evaluates the quality of the ecosystem. It not only clarifies the ecological background status, but also understands the ecological construction status of the national park, providing a healthy and stable ecosystem, coping with climate change, and warning ecological security risks for Sanjiangyuan National Park Mitigating the degradation process and other aspects can provide scientific basis and decision-making services. This dataset selects the vegetation coverage and net primary productivity of Sanjiangyuan National Park from 2010 to 2020 as key indicators to measure the ecosystem quality of Sanjiangyuan National Park. Among them, vegetation coverage refers to the proportion of the vertical projection of vegetation on the ground to the total area of the study area, calculated using the pixel binary model. Net primary productivity refers to the total capacity determined and the total amount of organic matter produced minus the amount consumed by vegetation respiration, which directly reflects the production capacity of vegetation communities under natural environmental conditions, characterizes the quality status of terrestrial ecosystems, and is calculated using the EC-LUE model developed based on vorticity-related carbon flux site data. This dataset calculates the values of two indicators before and after the pilot implementation of the Sanjiangyuan National Park system (2016) (2010–2015 and 2016–2020), standardizes them, and finally merges them into the spatial distribution dataset of the ecosystem quality of Sanjiangyuan National Park.",

                    "Answer": "The vegetation cover fraction calculations using the pixel dichotomy model focus on the proportion of the ground area covered by vegetation, providing a spatial measure of vegetation distribution. In contrast, net primary productivity estimations using the EC-LUE model assess the production capacity of vegetation by accounting for the organic matter produced minus the respiration consumption, offering insights into the ecosystem's functional quality. Both methods serve as complementary indicators of ecosystem quality, with vegetation cover giving a structural perspective and net primary productivity providing a functional assessment.",

Vegetation coverage represents the proportion of the area covered by vegetation, calculated using the pixel dichotomy model, while net primary productivity reflects the production capacity of vegetation communities under natural environmental conditions, derived using the EC-LUE model based on eddy covariance carbon flux data.",

Net primary productivity can be estimated using a light use efficiency model (EC-LUE model) developed from eddy covariance carbon flux site data. These methods can be applied to calculate these indicators for different time periods, such as before and after a policy implementation, and results can be standardized and combined to provide a comprehensive dataset of ecosystem quality spatial distribution.",
