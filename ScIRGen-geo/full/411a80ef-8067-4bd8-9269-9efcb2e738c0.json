These steps include utilizing the LandScan global population dynamic statistical analysis database, which involves analyzing population statistics within specific administrative boundaries using spatial data and image analysis techniques. The process requires the integration of innovative methods to produce a geographically accurate and reliable model. The data collection involves obtaining population density averages for the year 2019, correcting missing values, removing outliers, and conducting spatial comparisons both horizontally and vertically. This approach ensures the dataset is suitable for large-scale geographic research and can be updated as the number of Belt and Road countries increases.",
