            "description": "This dataset is generated by the Community Earth System Model version 2.0 (CESM2.0) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario, representing a global land surface climate dataset. To quantify the impact of future urbanization on global climate change, the dataset utilizes future scenario surface data with three different levels of urbanization development, resulting in three sub-datasets: (1) SSP585_UC_BNU, (2) SSP585_DU_BNU, and (3) SSP585_DU_GAO. In SSP585_UC_BNU, urbanization levels remain at the current level, using the 2020 global urbanization products simulated by He et al. (2021) under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5 (SSP5) scenario. In SSP585_DU_BNU, urbanization levels dynamically develop, utilizing the dynamic global urbanization products simulated by He et al. (2021) under the SSP5 scenario for the years 2020 to 2070. SSP585_DU_GAO adopts a faster urbanization rate, using the dynamic global urbanization products simulated by Gao & O'Neill (2020) under the SSP5 scenario for the years 2020 to 2070. The time cover for the SSP585_UC_BNU dataset is from 2015 to 2100, with monthly, daily, and hourly temporal resolutions. The hourly-scale data covers the years 2019 to 2023 and 2096 to 2100. The time cover for the SSP585_DU_BNU dataset is from 2015 to 2070, with a monthly temporal resolution. The time cover for the SSP585_DU_GAO dataset is from 2015 to 2100, with a monthly temporal resolution. The spatial resolution for all three sub-datasets is 0.9°×1.25°. The dataset includes variables at both grid and sub-grid scales, encompassing basic meteorological elements, surface energy fluxes, runoff, and more. Specific information about the simulated data can be found in the paper Zhang, K., Lee, X., Schultz, N. M., Zhao, L., He, C., Huang, Q., .Liu, Z., Chu, H & Zhao, J. (2023). A global dataset on subgrid land surface climate (2015–2100) from the Community Earth System Model. Geoscience Data Journal, 10(2), 208-219. DOI: 10.1002/gdj3.153. The dataset can be used for the research on the climate effect of urbanization, deforestation, lake expansion / shrinking.",

                "The urban heat island (UHI) refers to the phenomenon of higher temperature in a city than in its adjacent rural land. The UHI intensity can be quantified as the urban–rural contrast in surface temperature (SUHI) and in near-surface air temperature (AUHI). Generally, the SUHI intensity is computed from the city-wide mean surface temperature and the mean surface temperature of rural pixels in a buffer zone outside the city. Controls of spatial and temporal patterns in the SUHI are well understood. In comparison, our understanding of the AUHI patterns and their controlling factors is still primitive. Over the diurnal cycle, the SUHI peaks during the daytime, but the AUHI is usually greater at night. Studies that compare the SUHI and the AUHI across climate zones show that the SUHI is stronger than the AUHI by an average of 1.1 ± 1.1 K during the daytime and 0.3 ± 1.5 K during the nighttime. In comparison with the SUHI, the spatial variations in the AUHI and the associated biophysical controls are less understood. The SUHI is generally stronger in wetter climates. With regard to the spatial gradient in the AUHI, one study showed that the AUHI is negatively correlated with climate wetness, but another revealed that the AUHI is uncorrelated with precipitation."

Our second objective is to perform attribution analysis of the AUHI intensity."

They fall into three climate zones: humid (201 grids), semi-humid (118 grids), and semi-arid (36 grids) according to the Köppen–Geiger climate classification.

The annual mean midnight AUHI does not show discernible spatial patterns, but is generally stronger than the midday AUHI. The urban–rural difference in convection efficiency is the largest contributor to the midday AUHI in the humid (0.32 ± 0.09 K) and the semi-arid (0.36 ± 0.11 K) climate zones. The release of anthropogenic heat from urban land is the dominant contributor to the midnight AUHI in all three climate zones. The rural vegetation density is the most important driver of the daytime and nighttime AUHI spatial variations. A spatial covariance analysis revealed that this vegetation influence is manifested mainly through its regulation of heat storage in rural land."

This classification helps in analyzing the contributions and variations of AUHI patterns across diverse environmental conditions.",

Incorporating urban vegetation could improve the representation of biophysical processes and their influence on urban heat islands. This development could enhance the attribution analysis of urban heat intensity by considering factors such as leaf area index and rural vegetation density. However, achieving this sophistication would necessitate overcoming current limitations in model frameworks and increasing computational efficiency to handle the additional complexity.",
