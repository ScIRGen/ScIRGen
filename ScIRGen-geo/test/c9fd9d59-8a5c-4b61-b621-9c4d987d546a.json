The potential evapotranspiration (PET) is calculated based on penman Monteith model, in which the wind speed, relative humidity, sensible heat, latent heat, soil heat flux and surface pressure data are from GLDAS, air temperature data are from CPC, and precipitation data are also from CPC. GLDAS data is divided into two sections. The first section is from GLDAS_ NOAH10_ M v2.0 series, covering the period from 1948 to 2015; The second paragraph is from GLDAS_ NOAH10_ M v2.1, covering the period from 2000 to now, we spliced the overlapping data segments from 2000 to 2014, subtracted the average values of wind speed, relative humidity, sensible heat, latent heat, soil heat flux and surface air pressure of the two sets of data in this period, obtained the difference, and added the difference to the data set of v2.1 to calculate pet.",

This approach is comprehensive, integrating multiple atmospheric and surface parameters. Alternative models might use different parameters or simpler empirical approaches, potentially affecting the accuracy and applicability of the PET estimates across different climatic regions.",

                    "Answer": "The methodologies for calculating the global aridity index using data from GLDAS and CPC were developed due to the need for accurate potential evapotranspiration (PET) calculations. This required a combination of data inputs, such as wind speed, relative humidity, sensible heat, latent heat, soil heat flux, and surface pressure from GLDAS, and temperature and precipitation data from CPC. The integration of these datasets allowed for more reliable PET calculations using the Penman–Monteith model.",

                    "Answer": "Integrating data from different GLDAS versions may impact the accuracy of aridity index calculations by introducing inconsistencies in the input variables. To mitigate this, the data from overlapping periods (2000-2014) were averaged and differences were adjusted to harmonize the datasets, potentially reducing discrepancies in the calculated potential evapotranspiration (PET) and improving the reliability of the aridity index.",

                    "Answer": "To integrate and adjust data from different versions of GLDAS and CPC datasets for computing PET, one would first need to identify the overlapping data periods from GLDAS_NOAH10_M V2.0 (1948-2015) and GLDAS_NOAH10_M V2.1 (2000-present). Next, calculate the mean difference for variables such as wind speed, relative humidity, sensible heat, latent heat, soil heat flux, and surface pressure during the overlapping period (2000-2014). This difference should then be added to the V2.1 dataset variables to ensure continuity and accuracy in the PET calculations. Additionally, temperature and precipitation data sourced from CPC should be included in the Penman–Monteith model to calculate PET consistently across the entire data range from 1948 to 2018.",
