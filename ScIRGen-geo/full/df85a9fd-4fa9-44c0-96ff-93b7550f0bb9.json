            "description": "This dataset contains the glacier outlines in Qilian Mountain Area in 2020. The dataset was produced based on classical band ratio criterion and manual editing. Chinese GF series images collected in 2020 were used as basic data for glacier extraction. Sentinel-2 images, Google images and Map World images were employed as reference data for manual adjusting. The dataset was stored in SHP format and attached with the attributions of coordinates, glacier ID and glacier area. Consisting of 1 season, the dataset has a spatial resolution of 2 meters. The accuracy is about 1 pixel (±2 meter). The dataset directly reflects the glacier distribution within the Qilian Mountain in 2020, and can be used for quantitative estimation of glacier mass balance and the quantitative assessment of glacier change’s impact on basin runoff.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection methodology for extracting glacier boundaries in mountainous regions involves using high-resolution satellite imagery, such as the high-resolution series images from 2020 for the Qilian Mountains. This process includes the use of classic band ratio methods combined with manual correction to ensure accuracy. The use of reference images, such as Sentinel-2 images, Google imagery, and Tianditu imagery, supports the refinement of the boundaries. The spatial resolution achieved is 2 meters with boundary accuracy around the same level, which is essential for reflecting the precise distribution of glaciers in mountainous areas.",

                    "Answer": "Using a combination of classic band ratio method and manual correction for extracting glacier boundaries can enhance precision and reliability by ensuring that the automatic extraction results are refined and validated against human judgment. This method also allows for adjustments based on local conditions or anomalies that automated systems might miss, leading to more accurate representations of glacier distributions. Additionally, this approach can help mitigate errors introduced by sensor limitations or atmospheric conditions captured in the high-resolution images from sources like Sentinel-2, Google imagery, and Tianditu imagery.",
