                "The snow water equivalent (SWE) is an important parameter of surface hydrological and climate systems, and it has a profound impact on Arctic amplification and climate change. In the land region above 45◦N, the existing SWE products are associated with a limited time span and limited spatial coverage, and the spatial resolution is coarse, which greatly limits the application of SWE data in cryosphere change and climate change studies. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) AR6 (Sixth Assessment Report) notes that the Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has greatly decreased since 1950, and the feedback effect of the climate system caused by this reduction is extremely large. At present, there are many forms of SWE data in the world. According to type, these data can be divided into site observational SWE, remote sensing SWE, reanalysis SWE, data assimilation SWE, and model simulation SWE. However, the time ranges of AMSR-E and AMSR-E2 SWE are only from 2003 to the present, which is lacking in terms of time series. Although the reanalysis SWE data have good spatial and temporal continuity and high data integrity, their accuracy is poor, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.65. For remote sensing SWE, the spatiotemporal characteristics of different passive microwave SWE data differ significantly due to differences in sensors or retrieval algorithms. In summary, although there are a variety of SWE data in the world, the data quality is uncertain. Previous studies have shown that all kinds of SWE data in the Northern Hemisphere have advantages and disadvantages, and none of these data perform well in all aspects. An effective method was used in a study by Pulliainen et al. (2020), who applied a bias correction to GlobSnow and reanalysis data products based on SWE snow course measurements to obtain improved estimates on annual peak snow mass and SWE in the Northern Hemisphere."

In summary, based on the existing SWE data products, combining a machine learning algorithm to fuse multisource SWE data is an effective method to prepare SWE products with long time series and large spatial scales and retain the advantages of single SWE data products."

This is mainly because SWE from stations is discontinuous in time series and severely missing. There are great differences among remote sensing SWE, reanalysis SWE data, data assimilation SWE, and observational SWE. In summary, although there are a variety of SWE data in the world, the data quality is uncertain. However, the simple multisource data average cannot highlight the advantages of high-precision data, and it is easily affected by the weight ratio of low-precision data, which reduces the accuracy of fused data."

The HSSC dataset and Russian snow survey data were used as training sample data of “true SWE”, and the effect of altitude on the algorithm was also considered. Thus, we prepared a set of spatiotemporal seamless SWE datasets (RRM SWE) covering the land region above 45 ◦N from 1979 to 2019. In this study, we utilize the ridge regression model of a machine learning algorithm to fuse ERA-Interim SWE data, GLDAS SWE data, GlobSnow SWE data, AMSR-E/AMSR2 SWE data, and ERA5-Land SWE data to generate a set of new RRM SWE datasets."
