            "description": "The dataset of ground truth measurements synchronizing with MODIS, ALOS PALSAR and AMSR-E was obtained in the Biandukou foci experimental area on May 24, 2008. Observation items included:\n     (1) the surface temperature in No. 1 (grassland), No. 2 (the rape land), No. 3 (the rape land), No. 4 (the wheat land) and No. 5 quadrate (wheat and rape);\n     (2) the soil moisture by WET in No. 2 quadrate;\n     (3) GPR and WET;\n     (4) The spectrum by ASD Fieldspec FRTM (Boulder, Co, USA), 350nm-2500nm, 3nm for the visible near-infrared band and 10nm for the shortwave infrared band).  The spectrum data were archived in the ASCII format, with the first five rows as the file header and the following two columns as wavelength (nm) and reflectance (percentage) respectively, and can be opened by .txt or wordpad. The .txt file was not reflectance but intermediate file for further calculation. Raw data were binary files direct from ASD (by ViewSpecPro). The surface radiative temperature and the physical temperature were measured by the handheld infrared thermometer. Besides, the cover type was also recorded. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office. Soil moisture was acquired by WET and the cutting ring. The data can be opened by Microsoft Office.\n     Six data files were included, soil moisture, the surface temperature, GPR, coverage photos and preprocessed data, ground objects spectrum and satellite images.",
