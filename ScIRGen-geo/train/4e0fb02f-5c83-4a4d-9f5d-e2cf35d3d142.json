            "titleEn": "HiWATER: Dataset of flux observation matrix (No.2 eddy covariance system) of the multi-scale observation experiment on evapotranspiration over heterogeneous land surfaces (2012)",
            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from site No.2 eddy covariance system (EC) in the flux observation matrix from 3 June to 21 September, 2012. The site (100.35406° E, 38.88695° N) was located in a cropland (maize surface) in Yingke irrigation district, which is near Zhangye, Gansu Province. The elevation is 1559.09 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3.7 m; the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3&Li7500) was 0.15 m.\nRaw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Edire post-processing software (University of Edinburgh, http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/abs/research/micromet/EdiRe/), including spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. Moreover, the observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC), which was proposed by Foken and Wichura [1996]: class 1 (level 0: Δst<30 and ITC<30), class 2 (level 1: Δst<100 and ITC<100), and class 3 (level 2: Δst>100 and ITC>100), representing high-, medium-, and low-quality data, respectively. In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 3% of the 30 min raw record; and (4) data were rejected at night when the friction velocity (u*) was less than 0.1 m/s. There were 48 records per day; the missing data were replaced with -6999. Moreover, suspicious data were marked in red.\nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m^3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m^3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (z/L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m^2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m^2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m^2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xlsx format.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al.

Additional factors include instrument drift and the need for various corrections, such as coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and virtual temperature correction. These factors necessitate careful data filtering and quality assessment to ensure accurate flux measurements.",

                    "Answer": "Post-processing techniques such as coordinate rotation and density correction can improve data accuracy and quality by ensuring that the flux measurements reflect true atmospheric conditions. For instance, coordinate rotation aligns the wind measurements with the mean wind direction, reducing errors caused by sensor misalignment. Density correction accounts for the effect of air density fluctuations on gas concentration measurements, which is crucial for accurate flux estimations. However, these techniques also introduce potential sources of error if not applied correctly, such as incorrect assumptions in the correction models or inappropriate parameter settings, which can lead to biased data or misinterpretation of flux results.",

                    "Answer": "The procedures involved include: despiking to remove outlier values, time delay correction, double coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, ultrasonic virtual temperature correction, and density (WPL) correction. Quality assessment is also performed on flux values based on atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity characteristics. Additional filtering includes removing data during instrument errors, around precipitation events, when data gaps exceed 3% within a 30-minute period, and during nighttime weak turbulence (u* < 0.1 m/s).",

                    "Answer": "The use of eddy covariance systems for precise measurement of evapotranspiration is enabled by advancements such as high-frequency data collection at 10Hz, integration of sonic anemometers and CO2/H2O analyzers with precise positioning and orientation, and sophisticated data processing software like Edire, which allows for detailed post-processing including outlier removal, time delay correction, coordinate rotation, frequency response correction, and density corrections.",
