In order to study the variation of TP thermal effect and its influence on the surrounding climate, the basic data related to TP heat source are needed.\nThis data set is composed of monthly basic heat source data of the TP and its surrounding areas calculated from reanalysis data, and its horizontal range covers 40°E-180° and 20°S-80°N. The spatial resolution is 2.5 ° x2.5 °, and the datasets mainly included ERA5 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data.",

The CGT exhibits a stationary Rossby wave trapped in the basic flow, which has been confirmed by the analysis of Rossby wavenumbers. The scale of the westerly jet stream allows the propagation of the CGT throughout the entire northern hemisphere. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) covers an area of 2.9 million km² and is the highest plateau in the world with an average elevation > 4000 m. The atmospheric heat source over the TP is formed by the SSHF, latent heat release (LH), and radiative convergence during summer. The latent heating release contributes > 60% of the TP HS in summer."

The LBM with a horizontal resolution of T42 and 20 sigma vertical levels developed by Watanabe and Kimoto (2000) is used to explore the ideal atmospheric steady response to the diabatic heating anomaly. Integration of the model is continued to 30 days after given the diabatic heating anomaly and the results averaged for days 26–30 are shown as the steady response of the atmospheric to a prescribed diabatic heating anomaly. The diabatic heating anomaly given to the LBM is calculated from the 3D composite difference field between strong positive and negative heating years in specific areas. The AGCM module (Community Atmospheric Model version 5.1; CAM5.1) of the Community Earth System Model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (Neale et al. 2010) is used to investigate the TP-CGT pattern induced by the WTP HS and to compare the"

These results enhance our understanding of the relationship between the circumglobal teleconnection and the ISM and is helpful for improving the prediction of the circumglobal teleconnection variability."
