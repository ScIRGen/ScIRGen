The whole rock geochemical data of major elements are obtained by XRF, the trace element geochemical data are obtained by ICP-MS, the zircon U-Pb isotopic data are obtained by LA-ICP-MS, and the zircon Hf isotopic data are obtained by MC-ICP-MS. All the above data have been published in Precambrian Research, an authoritative geoscience journal, and the data are authentic. Through this set of data, the regional crustal structure characteristics and multi-stage reconstruction process can be effectively constrained.",
