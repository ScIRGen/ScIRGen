            "description": "The data include two main files, one is the comparison of the accuracy of glacier surface temperature obtained from automatic weather stations and near-surface temperature obtained from MODIS; the second is the seasonal and annual time series heat waves calculated for the glacier surface on the Tibetan Plateau from 2001 to 2020 based on MODIS LST with reference to Hoday et al. (2016) on the definition of heat waves. Only glaciers covered by MODIS pure pixels are included in this dataset. In addition, linear trends in heat wave intensity and duration with their significance and confidence intervals were calculated for each pixel based on a linear model. The geographic coordinates of the corresponding records are included in each file. The reference coordinate system is the Albers equal-area projection with a central longitude of 105 and standard latitude lines of 25 and 47.",

                    "Answer": "The use of MODIS LST allows for broader spatial coverage as it includes only glacier areas fully covered by MODIS pixels, whereas automatic weather stations provide point-based data which might be more accurate in terms of temperature measurements but limited in spatial coverage. The comparison of temperature accuracy between these two methods is a key aspect of the dataset, highlighting the difference in precision and scope between satellite-derived data and ground-based observations.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in accurately measuring glacier surface heatwaves on the Tibetan Plateau using satellite data arise from several factors such as the need to validate satellite-derived temperatures against ground-based measurements like those from automatic weather stations. Additionally, only MODIS pure pixel-covered glaciers are included, which may limit data accuracy and availability. The use of linear models to calculate heatwave intensity and duration trends also introduces potential errors, and these calculations require careful consideration of statistical significance and confidence intervals.",

                    "Answer": "The comparison of temperature data from glacier surface automatic weather stations and near-surface temperature data derived from MODIS could highlight differences in data accuracy and reliability. The implications may include variations in temperature readings due to different spatial resolutions and data acquisition methods, potentially affecting the interpretation of heatwave trends on glacier surfaces. Such comparisons could also inform improvements in calibration and validation techniques for satellite-derived temperature datasets.",
