            "description": "The data are the whole rock major and trace element and Sr-Nd isotopic geochemical data of adakites and enclaves in Tongguanshan Cu-Au polymetallic deposit in Tongling area, as well as zircon in-situ Hf-O isotopic and U-Pb dating data and apatite in-situ major and trace element geochemical data. The samples are adakitic intrusive rocks and enclaves. The lithology of host rocks is granodiorite and quartz monzodiorite, and the lithology of enclaves is quartz monzodiorite. The major element data of whole rock were obtained by XRF analysis, the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS analysis, and the Sr-Nd isotopic composition was obtained by MC-ICP-MS analysis. Zircon U-Pb isotopic dating data and in-situ O isotopic composition were obtained by SIMS analysis, while in-situ Lu-Hf isotopic data were obtained by LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis. The major and trace element data of apatite were obtained by EMPA and LA-ICP-MS, respectively. The above data have been published in high-level SCI journals (Ore Geology Reviews), and the data are true and reliable. The data obtained can be used to study the genesis of adakitic rocks and associated Cu-Au deposits.",
            "instructions": "All data are stored in Excel file and can be opened directly in Excel workbook. The file named \"WR_MajTra\" represents the geochemical data of major and trace elements in the whole rock, \"WR_SrNd\" represents the whole rock Sr Nd radioisotope data, \"Zrn_UPb\" represents U-Pb isotopic composition and age data of zircon, \"Zrn_HfO\" stands for zircon Hf-O isotope data, \"AP_MajTra“ represents the major and trace element geochemical data of apatite.",

The study of adakite involves collecting whole-rock major and trace element data using methods like XRF and ICP-MS, as well as isotopic data such as Sr-Nd isotopes using MC-ICP-MS and zircon U-Pb dating via SIMS, to understand the genesis of associated mineral deposits.",

                    "Answer": "Challenges in accurately determining the geochemical data of adakitic rocks and associated mineral deposits can arise from the complexity of the rock types, such as adakitic intrusive rocks and their inclusions, as well as the surrounding granodiorite and quartz diorite. The precision of the analytical techniques used, such as XRF for major elements, ICP-MS for trace elements, and MC-ICP-MS for Sr-Nd isotopes, also plays a role. Additionally, the reliability of in-situ zircon U-Pb dating and isotopic analyses using SIMS and LA-MC-ICP-MS can affect data accuracy. Variations in mineral composition and the presence of inclusions can further complicate geochemical characterization.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing advanced isotopic analysis techniques like MC-ICP-MS and SIMS allows for precise determination of isotopic compositions and dating, which can lead to a better understanding of the geochemical processes and timelines involved in the formation of copper-gold polymetallic deposits. This can result in more accurate models of mineralization and insights into the tectonic settings and geological history that contributed to the deposit's formation.",
