                "Soil moisture is a key element in controlling land surface energy partitioning, surface water budget, and vegetation transpiration and carbon assimilation. Knowledge regarding the regional/global soil moisture state is essential for understanding, modeling, and forecasting of the weather/climate, flood/drought early warning and monitoring, and crop yield estimation. However, in situ observations are too sparse to provide large-scale spatiotemporal features of soil moisture. By contrast, satellite microwave remote sensing is a promising approach to provide large-scale soil moisture state, with advantages of short revisit period and all-weather ability. With the launch of several microwave instruments over the past two decades, great efforts have been focused on developing the global soil moisture products from active/passive microwave signals. Currently, L band microwave satellites are considered to be the most promising for estimating surface soil moisture. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission of European Space Agency (ESA) carries the first operational L band radiometer to produce soil moisture product with a spatial resolution of ~40 km. The latest L band satellite, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission of NASA, carries a radiometer and a radar."

The SMOS uses the interferometric technique to retrieve brightness temperature and suffers more RFI pollutions than SMAP. The underestimation of the effective soil temperature would lead to higher soil microwave emissivity and further result in the underestimation of soil moisture."

There are 56 soil moisture and temperature measurement (SMTM) stations deployed in Naqu network by three field campaigns during the summers of 2010–2012. At each station, one SMTM sensor is obliquely inserted into 0–5 cm topsoil, which is comparable to the depth penetrated by L band passive microwave sensors (e.g., the SMOS and SMAP). In Pali Network, 21 SMTM stations were deployed during the summer of 2015. The installation of soil moisture and temperature sensors is the same as that of Naqu network. In consideration of the spatial representativeness issue, the measurements from SMTM stations of the Naqu large-scale network are averaged to represent the ground truth of Naqu network. Then, the station-averaged in situ surface soil moisture (0–5 cm) is compared with three satellite soil moisture retrievals in the two networks, respectively."

            "findings": [
                "It is found that the SMAP retrievals tend to underestimate soil moisture in the two TP networks, mainly due to the negative biases in the effective soil temperature that is derived from a climate model. However, the SMAP product well captures the amplitude and temporal variation of the soil moisture. The SMOS product performs well in Naqu network with acceptable error metrics but fails to capture the temporal variation of soil moisture in Pali network. The AMSR2 products evidently exaggerate the temporal variation of soil moisture in Naqu network but dampen it in Pali network, suggesting its retrieval algorithm needs further improvements for the TP."

This involves using radiometers or radars on satellites such as SMAP, SMOS, and AMSR2 to detect microwave signals that are sensitive to soil moisture levels, and then applying algorithms to convert these signals into measurements of soil moisture.",

It is a critical factor when evaluating satellite-derived soil moisture data, as the spatial resolution of in situ sensors is typically much smaller than that of satellite sensors, potentially leading to mismatches in data comparison.",

These networks provide ground truth data that can be used to validate satellite retrievals of soil moisture and temperature. For example, in the Tibetan Plateau, such networks have been used to compare in situ measurements with satellite data from missions like SMOS and SMAP.",

                    "Answer": "The challenges of spatial representativeness affect the interpretation of data from soil moisture monitoring networks in remote regions by creating potential discrepancies between point-based in situ data and broader-scale satellite-derived datasets. Remote regions often have heterogeneous landscapes, which means in situ stations might not capture the full range of variability present in larger areas covered by satellite observations. This can lead to challenges in accurately validating satellite products, as localized measurements may not fully represent the spatially averaged conditions detected by the satellites. Addressing these challenges requires careful consideration of the spatial representation of network measurements and possibly using averaged data from multiple stations to better match the satellite footprints.",
