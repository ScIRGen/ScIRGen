      "description": "The dataset of airborne Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometers (PLMR) was acquired on 1 August, 2012, located in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The aircraft took off at 8:30 am (UTC+8) from Zhangye airport and landed at 12:30 pm, with the flight time of 4 hours. The flight was performed in the altitude of about 1000 m and at the speed of about 220-250 km during the observation, corresponding to an expected ground resolution of about 300 m. \nThe PLMR instrument flown on a small aircraft operates at 1.413 GHz (L-band), with both H- and V-polarizations at incidence angles of ±7.5°, ±21.5° and ±38.5°. PLMR ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ calibrations were performed before and after each flight. The processed PLMR data include 2 DAT files (v-pol and h-pol separately) and 1 KMZ file for each flying day. The DAT file contains all the TB values together with their corresponding beam ID, incidence angle, location, time stamp (in UTC) and other flight attitude information as per headings. The KMZ file shows the gridded 1-km TB values corrected to 38.5 degrees together with flight lines. Cautions should be taken when using these data, as the RFI contaminations are often higher than expected at v-polarization.",

        "The alpine region is important in riverine and watershed ecosystems as a contributor of freshwater, providing and stimulating specific habitats for biodiversity. In parallel, recent climate change, human activities, and other perturbations may disturb hydrological processes and eco-functions, creating the need for next-generation observational and modeling approaches to advance a predictive understanding of such processes in the alpine region. Water resources in the alpine region are headwaters that need to be regulated to sustain downstream ecosystems. However, perturbations induced by nature/climate change and human activities in recent years have significantly reformed hydrological processes and eco-functions. Accurate estimation and prediction of hydrological processes and their key impact factors has since become crucial.",
        "Unfortunately, the scarcity of observation data in the alpine region, due to the difficulties of access and technological barriers, has hindered alpine hydrological modeling and associated research yet motivated the development of next-generation ecosystem observation networks and experiments. In comparison with the observations, using remote sensing data combined with data assimilation could improve the prediction of hydrological processes. However, due to the complexities of the earth system, there exist various sources of uncertainties in remote sensing data (especially in the alpine region), which have to be validated and calibrated. In summary, to fill the knowledge gap and promote alpine region hydrology research, an integrated, distributed and multiscale observation dataset is essential and expected to provide accurate forcing data for hydrological modeling, validate remote sensing data, allow the evaluation of distributed models and ultimately improve a predictive understanding of alpine hydrological processes and ecosystem functions. In alpine hydrology, in addition to consistent hydrometeorological data obtained from distributed meteorological stations, snow cover and frozen ground are two important indexes and driving forces that manipulate hydrological processes. The maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) before ablation determines the storage of snowmelt – a major source of freshwater in the alpine region, while freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) and soil moisture within the active layer alter water infiltration and, consequently, surface runoff and groundwater. To promote alpine hydrology research, the International Network for Alpine Research Catchment Hydrology (INARCH) was launched in 2015 by the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), involving 18 catchments around the world. The INARCH has since connected individual observatories into an international network and data-share platform to lead frontier research on alpine region hydrometeorology and snow observation. Another community-based observation network, the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, was initiated in the early 1990s to observe the response of the active layer and near-surface permafrost to climate change. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is the second largest inland river basin in China and is known for its heterogeneous landscapes, diverse ecosystems, unique geographical characteristics and climate change over recent decades. As a major component of the ecohydrological processes in the arid/semi-arid HRB, the alpine hydrological processes, especially those related to snow cover and frozen ground in the upper reaches, have great impacts on runoff in the mountainous region, which then regulate agricultural development in the middle reaches and the ecosystems of the lower reaches.",
        "In recent years, with climate warming, permafrost degradation has significantly affected runoff and the carbon cycle (Peng et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018). Snow cover is widely distributed with unique characteristics in the study area. In the high-altitude mountainous region (elevation > 3800 m), influenced by the local microclimate and low temperature, snowfall could occur in any season. Temporary snow is the major snow cover type in the region at middle and low elevations because strong solar radiation and high air temperature lead to fast melting and sublimation of the snow. Drifting snow is also commonly observed in the region, which may lead to the redistribution of snowpack in high elevation regions (Essery et al., 1999; Li et al., 2014).",
        "Blowing (drifting) snow is commonly observed in the Qilian mountain due to its high altitude and complex terrain. It is important to estimate the occurrence of blowing snow because it may cause redistributions of the snow cover and influence the sublimation of snow.",
        "Soil heat conductivity is difficult to analyze because it is a function of soil density, soil moisture content (ice content in frozen ground), and soil temperature, which cannot be easily calculated using a simple formula. Therefore, site observations can be utilized to evaluate the parameterization of alpine hydrologic models."

However, the above modeling efforts suffered from 1) the availability of the forcing data (only two weather stations operated by the Chinese Meteorological Administration functioned in the upper reaches of the HRB) and 2) a lack of high-quality snow and frozen ground data for parameterization.",

        "Gap-free meteorological and hydrological data were monitored from an observation network connecting a group of automatic meteorological stations (AMSs). In addition, to capture snow accumulation and ablation processes, snow cover properties were collected from a snow observation superstation using state-of-the-art techniques and instruments. High-resolution soil physics datasets were also obtained to capture the freeze-thaw processes from a frozen ground observation superstation.",
        "Considering the characteristics of the study site, an integrated, distributed and multiscale hydrometeorological – snow – frozen ground observation network has been established with seven automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) and two superstations. At the basin scale, the observation aims to collect data for investigating the meteorological driving forces and for validation of the alpine hydrological models. At the sub-basin scale, small-scale observations and measurements focus on data such as precipitation, soil temperature and moisture, which are used to develop and improve hydrologic models, as well as to validate remote sensing products at medium to coarse resolutions (Jin et al., 2014). At the two superstations for snow cover and frozen ground observations, remote sensing products can be further validated using fine-resolution data. In total, seven AMSs, as well as the frozen ground and snow superstations (also incorporating meteorological observations), were established in the study area during the intensive observation period (IOP: 2013 -2014) to obtain the spatially distributed meteorological variables. After the IOP, four typical AMSs were selected and retained for continuous observation, which is expected to provide long-term datasets. The observed meteorological variables include wind (speed and direction), air temperature, humidity, infrared temperature, air pressure, four-component radiation, and precipitation. Accumulation and depletion processes were measured automatically at the Yakou snow superstation. The observed components included snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE, measured by GammaMONitor, GMON), albedo of the snow surface and blowing (drifting) snow flux (measured by FlowCapt). Soil temperature and moisture were measured within six layers at each AMS, while evapotranspiration (ET) was observed by eddy covariance (EC) at three AMSs located in permafrost, seasonally frozen ground and a transient zone to observe freeze-thaw (FT) processes. At the sub-basin scale, a wireless sensor network (WSN) with 40 nodes was established to capture seasonal changes in soil temperature and moisture. At the A’rou frozen ground superstation, soil temperature and moisture profiles were intensively measured in eighteen layers to a depth of 3.2 m (in a nested pattern with more layers in the topsoil) to obtain the soil hydrothermal features under freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). In addition, thermal conductivity and hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil were also measured to observe the dynamic hydrothermal processes within.",
        "Snow depth was measured by SR50A (Campbell, USA), which determines the distance between the sensor and the target by sending out ultrasonic pulses and listening for the returning echoes reflected from the target. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured by GMON (CS725 GammaMONitor, Campbell, USA) from 2014/1/1 to 2017/12/31 at a temporal resolution of 6 hr. FlowCapt (IAV, Switzerland) was used to measure the number of blowing snow grains at 3 heights (0-1 m, 1-2 m, and 2-3 m) every 10 mins."
