            "description": "In the late 1970s, China adopted the plant habitat classification method to carry out a unified grassland resource survey throughout the country, which lasted nearly 10 years. The national grassland resource survey was completed in 1988. By the early 1990s, supplemented by aerial and satellite film verification, the county-level 1:50000 or 1:100000 grassland type map was compiled and reduced to 1:1000000 national grassland resource map. The data set is 1km from the source of Sanjiang River in 1990s × Spatial distribution data of grassland types on 1km grid.\nb. Time range of data:\n191990s\nc.

                    "Answer": "In the 1990s, the plant-habitat classification method was developed as part of a nationwide effort to standardize grassland resource surveys. This approach was likely influenced by the need for a systematic way to categorize diverse grassland ecosystems across China, which was facilitated by advancements in aerial and satellite photography for verification purposes, contributing to the completion of detailed grassland type maps at the county and national levels.",

                    "Answer": "The primary objective of creating a dataset representing the spatial distribution of grassland types in the Sanjiangyuan region during the 1990s is to provide comprehensive spatial data that supports ecological and environmental research. This dataset aids in understanding vegetation patterns, assessing changes in land cover, and supporting sustainable management and conservation efforts in the region. By offering detailed information on grassland types, researchers can analyze ecological dynamics, monitor environmental changes, and develop strategies for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Sanjiangyuan area.",
