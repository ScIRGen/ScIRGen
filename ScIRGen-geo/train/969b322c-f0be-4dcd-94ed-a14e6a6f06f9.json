            "description": "On 25 July 2012, a Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner boarded on the Y-12 aircraft was used to obtain the point cloud data. Leica ALS70 airborne laser scanner has unlimited numbers of returns intensities measurements including the first, second, third return intensities. The wavelength of laser light is 1064 nm. The absolute flight altitude is 4800 m with the point cloud density 1 points per square meter. Aerial LiDAR-DEM was obtained through parameter calibration, automatic classification of point cloud density and manual editing.",

The process involves parameter calibration, automatic point cloud classification, and manual editing to produce DEM and DSM data products.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of an aircraft and lidar system for aerial remote sensing experiments in ecological hydrology is influenced by factors such as the desired altitude for data collection, the specific technical capabilities of the lidar system (e.g., wavelength, multi-return capabilities), the density of the point cloud required, and the characteristics of the region being observed, such as terrain and vegetation density. For example, the choice of using a Y-12 aircraft equipped with the Leica ALS70 lidar system, which operates at a wavelength of 1064 nm and supports multiple return signals, was based on these considerations to effectively cover the upstream Tianlaochi flight area at an absolute flight altitude of 4800 meters and achieve an average point cloud density of 1 point per square meter.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing airborne LiDAR data collected at an absolute flight altitude of 4800 meters with multiple return signals can result in a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) with an average point cloud density of 1 point per square meter. The use of multiple return signals (1, 2, 3, and last) allows for more detailed data collection, which can improve the accuracy and resolution of the final DEM product after processes like parameter calibration, automatic point cloud classification, and manual editing.",

This involves using LIDAR's capability to capture multiple returns and high-density point clouds, ultimately aiding in detailed hydrological and ecological studies within the region.",
