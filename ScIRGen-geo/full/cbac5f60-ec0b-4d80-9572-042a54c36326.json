            "description": "This dataset is the Global Urban Land Areas Composite Index (NUACI) dataset from 1984 to 2020. NUACI is a novel remote sensing index proposed by Professor Xiaoping Liu and others from Sun Yat-sen University, which integrates multiple remote sensing indices such as NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, and the intensity of night-time light remote sensing. It can be used to indicate urban evolution. The higher the NUACI, the more likely the pixel is to be urban. This dataset by obtained by directly calculating the remote sensing index production using Landsat images from 1984 to 2020 in the GEE platform. The global urban land-use change detection dataset obtained by segmentation of this dataset has an overall year-to-year accuracy of more than 75%. This dataset can be used for global year-by-year urban land use detection, year-by-year urban new land use change detection and other scenarios.",

This percentage is projected to increase to 68% by 2050. Urban area composition is highly dynamic; however, our understanding of how cities change in space and over time is limited by the lack of spatially and temporally comprehensive urban land cover data at a high resolution. The current understanding of urban growth is largely based on demographic (population) data rather than information describing the spatial and temporal patterns of urban land-cover change. At a global scale, satellite-based approaches are essential for mapping changes in urban extent, but higher-resolution satellite-derived global urban land-cover maps are available only for specific epochs, while annual global products have coarse spatial resolutions of 0.5 to 1.0 km. The result is that existing datasets lack the spatial and temporal resolutions needed to fully capture urban changes, especially in areas undergoing rapid growth, such as China and India."

Looking ahead, using these maps in conjunction with integrated assessment models can facilitate greater understanding of the complex environmental impacts of urbanization and help urban planners avoid natural hazards; for example, by limiting new development in flood risk zones."

First, we defined the extent of urbanized land between 1985 and 2015 by fusing four available global urban-extent maps with similar spatial resolutions for 1985 and 2015. We extracted cells from the two fusion maps that changed from non-urban in 1985 to urban in 2015. We then used an annual time series (1985–2015) of the normalized urban areas composite index (NUACI) to detect the year of urbanization and green recovery (vegetative regrowth or new plantings in built environments) for each pixel within this urbanized extent. Finally, we assessed the accuracy of all derived products over the past three decades."

                    "Answer": "The rapid rate of urban expansion, which has been found to be significantly faster than population growth, highlights the need for urban land-cover datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution. Existing datasets often lack the necessary resolution to capture these changes accurately, particularly in rapidly growing regions like China and India. Improved datasets can better inform urban planning and sustainable development efforts by accurately reflecting the extent of urbanization.",

The methodology adapts to these challenges by integrating various data sources and focusing on areas with sufficient data quality, thus managing uncertainties in regions with sparse data.",

The index combines multiple remote sensing indices to provide a comprehensive view of urban dynamics.",

Initially, urbanized land extents are defined by fusing global urban-extent maps from 1985 and 2015. Cells that converted from non-urban to urban are extracted, and an annual series of NUACI is used to identify the specific year of urbanization and subsequent green recovery. Accuracy is then assessed over the past three decades to ensure reliability.",

                    "Answer": "The lack of spatial and temporal resolutions in datasets is often due to the unequal distribution of Landsat observations across space and time, along with their uneven quality due to varying cloud cover. This results in limited observations for earlier years, particularly before the 1990s, and in regions such as Africa, Middle Asia, and the global tropics, leading to higher uncertainties in detecting urban expansion and green recovery in these areas and years.",

The task is further complicated by variations in data quality and availability, particularly in certain regions and for earlier time periods, which can affect the consistency and accuracy of the results.",

                    "Answer": "The discrepancy between the rate of urban expansion and population growth can be attributed to the observation that urban land area is expanding faster than population growth. This indicates that urban development is not solely driven by demographic changes, and the urban land area exceeds what is needed to sustain population growth, suggesting other factors such as economic development, infrastructure expansion, or policy-driven urban planning might be contributing to this rapid urbanization.",

First, we defined the extent of urbanized land between 1985 and 2015 by fusing four available global urban-extent maps with similar spatial resolutions for 1985 and 2015. We extracted cells from the two fusion maps that changed from non-urban in 1985 to urban in 2015. We then used an annual time series (1985–2015) of the normalized urban areas composite index (NUACI) to detect the year of urbanization and green recovery (vegetative regrowth or new plantings in built environments) for each pixel within this urbanized extent. Finally, we assessed the accuracy of all derived products over the past three decades.",

This rate is four times greater than previous reputable estimates from worldwide individual cities, suggesting an unprecedented rate of global urbanization. The rate of urban expansion is notably faster than that of population growth, indicating that the urban land area already exceeds what is needed to sustain population growth.",
