The depth of the Dasuopu ice core 2(C2) is 149.2 meters, while that of the Dasuopu ice core 3(C3) is 167.7 meters. C3 was drilled from the top of the glacier, and C2 was drilled 100 meters below.\nThe data set contains 3 tables: the oxygen isotope, dust, and main anion average data of Dasuopu ice core 3 (1450-1996), the 10-year of oxygen isotope, dust, and main anion average data of Dasuopu ice core 3 (1000-1996), and the accumulation data of Dasuopu ice cores 2 and 3（1442-1996）. \nSource of the data：National Centers for Environmental Information（http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/ice-core） \nTable 1：The annual average data of oxygen isotope, dust, and main anion of Dasuopu ice core 3 (1450-1996) \na.

                "The Holocene climate of the southern Tibetan Plateau has been dominated by the South Asian Monsoon in the summer and by westerly cyclonic activity in the winter. The strength of the monsoon is determined by a number of forcing mechanisms operating over a variety of time scales. Northern Hemisphere (NH) insolation has been relatively high over the past 10,000 years with correspondingly greater monsoonal activity than during the last glacial stage, when NH insolation was lower. At that time, reduced differential heating between the Indian Ocean and the Asian continent weakened the summer circulation, producing cooler, drier conditions over Asia and across the southern plateau. On shorter time scales, variations in the strength of the South Asian Monsoon have been explained by changes in internal boundary conditions, such as increasing tropical sea surface temperatures, variations in Eurasian snow cover, and linkages with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The Himalayas contain the largest volume of ice outside the polar regions, and the meltwater from its glaciers form the headwaters of such important rivers as the Indus and the Ganges."

The first core (C1) was 159.9 m long and was drilled at 7000 m above sea level (a.s.l.) down the flow line from the top of the col, and two cores (C2 and C3), 149.2 and 167.7 m long, respectively, were drilled to bedrock 100 m apart on the col at 7200 m a.s.l. All cores were analyzed over their entire lengths for oxygen isotopic ratio (d18O), chemical composition, and dust concentration. Most of the results presented here are from C3, which was cut into 6903 samples for both d18O and hydrogen isotopes (dD) and into 6419 samples each for insoluble dust, chloride (Cl–), sulfate (SO4 2–), and nitrate (NO3 2) analyses. Borehole temperatures were –16.0°C at 10 m depth and –13.8°C at the ice-bedrock contact, demonstrating that the Dasuopu glacier is frozen to its bed."
