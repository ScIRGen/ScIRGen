            "description": "The annual emission data of conventional air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, NH3, NOX) under different carbon neutralization technologies and air pollutant end treatment scenario combinations from 2017 to 2060, generated based on the computable general equilibrium model and the base year emission inventory, are used for the policy scenario analysis of the future coordinated treatment of carbon dioxide and air pollution in China. This data has been applied to the evaluation of the health synergy benefits of the carbon neutral technology path, as the data input of the health impact assessment model, to estimate the premature death, incidence rate and the resulting life expectancy loss, and to monetize these health impacts. The health common interests of monetization are compared with the corresponding emission reduction costs to explore the cost-effectiveness of different carbon neutral technology combinations.",
