It aims at data arrangement and service of Heihe River Basin Ecological hydrological process integration research. The atlas will provide researchers with a comprehensive and detailed background introduction and basic data set of Heihe River Basin.\nThe scale of Zhangye irrigation canal system map in Heihe River Basin is 1:2500000, the normal axis is equal to the conic projection, and the standard latitude is 2547 n.\nData sources: Zhangye irrigation canal system data of Heihe River Basin, administrative boundary data of one million Heihe River Basin in 2008, and Heihe River Basin in 2009.            \nThe channels of Heihe River Basin are mainly distributed in Zhangye, which are divided into five levels: dry, branch, Dou, Nong and Mao.",

                    "Answer": "The distribution patterns of irrigation canals in the Zhangye region, which are categorized into five levels (干、支、斗、农、毛), provide insights into water management and resource distribution across the area. These patterns can influence ecological and hydrological processes by determining water availability, affecting soil moisture levels, and impacting agricultural productivity. Understanding these patterns helps researchers infer the interaction between human activities and natural water cycles in the Heihe River Basin.",

                    "Answer": "The distribution and classification of irrigation canal systems in the Heihe River Basin are influenced by geographical and administrative factors, as evidenced by the use of data from the Zhangye irrigation canal system and administrative boundaries. These factors affect data collection methods by necessitating a comprehensive approach that integrates geographical mapping (e.g., using projections like the equal-area conic projection) and administrative data to accurately reflect the canal distribution and classification across different levels such as main canals, branches, and farm-level channels.",

                    "Answer": "The creation of a comprehensive ecological-hydrological atlas for the Heihe River Basin involves several key steps. Initially, data collection focuses on gathering diverse datasets, including irrigation systems in Zhangye and administrative boundaries from 2008 and 2009. The data is then organized using a consistent scale, such as 1:2500000 for the irrigation systems map, and standardized projections like the equal-area conic projection with specified standard parallels. This process ensures the integration of different data types into a cohesive and comprehensive atlas that supports ecological and hydrological research in the Heihe River Basin.",
