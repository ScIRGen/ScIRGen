            "description": "Huangnikeng gold deposit is a newly discovered gold deposit in the Guangning Luoding fault zone of the southern qinhang metallogenic belt in recent years. In this study, the ore and wall rock of huangnikeng gold mine were studied by thin section and light section, and systematic microscopic lithofacies mineralogy observation was carried out by using electron microscope. Some samples were observed by SEM, and the major element composition of Ag Au and pyrite was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), It provides evidence for defining the genesis of the deposit. Four main metallogenic stages have been identified according to the interpenetration and metasomatism of minerals and the difference of chemical composition. It is speculated that the geological and minerogenetic sequence of huangnikeng gold deposit is consistent with that of orogenic gold deposit. It is preliminarily considered that huangnikeng gold deposit is a typical orogenic gold deposit in the southern part of qinhang junction belt.",
