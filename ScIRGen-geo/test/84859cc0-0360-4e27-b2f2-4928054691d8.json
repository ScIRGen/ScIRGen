By combining the distribution map of grassland types on a scale of 1: 1 million, taking into account the spatial distribution, climate factors, terrain and soil conditions of grassland types in the study area, as well as the distribution of sampling points, the grassland in the study area is divided into three grassland areas: alpine meadow, alpine grassland, and temperate grassland. Based on the established NDVI and the corresponding database of grass yield and dry weight, a grass yield estimation model combining ground remote sensing was constructed in different zones to obtain the grass yield. The Three Rivers Source Area is an important source of rivers in China. Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of grassland yield over the years in this area, exploring the relationship between grassland yield and other environmental factors, is of great significance for rational management of grasslands and guiding the development of animal husbandry in future climate change scenarios.",

                "The Three River Headwater Region is one of the source areas of China's major rivers. The grassland ecosystem is the most predominant ecosystem type in the Three River Headwater Region, covering about 65% of the total area. The protection of grassland ecosystems in the Three River Headwater Region not only affects the local ecological environment and livestock production but also has significant implications for water conservation, ecological security, and economic development in China and Southeast Asia. In recent decades, global climate change and human activities (such as overgrazing and the implementation of ecological protection and construction projects in the Three River Headwater Region) have directly or indirectly impacted the grassland productivity in the Three River Headwater Region. Due to the unique ecological environment of the Three River Headwater Region, current research on the ecological environment status, grassland degradation, and land use/cover change in the source area is abundant and relatively mature, but quantitative research on grassland productivity over many years in the source area is still insufficient. The overall trend of temperature in the Three River Headwater Region is increasing, and the response of grassland ecosystems to warming is relatively consistent, mainly manifested as an earlier start of the growing season, accelerated growth during the growing season, and an extended growing season. However, compared to temperature, the changes in precipitation patterns (such as spatial distribution of precipitation, seasonal distribution of precipitation, and interannual variation of precipitation) are much more complex, with greater spatial and temporal variability, and the trend of changes in precipitation patterns in the source area is still highly debated."

This study attempts to address these two questions to provide some scientific reference for further analysis of the impact of precipitation pattern changes on the grassland ecosystem in the Three River Headwater Region and to provide important theoretical support for grassland ecosystem management under future climate change scenarios."

Then, we used these models to estimate the distribution of grassland yield in The Three River Headwater Region during 2006-2013.

The size of the grassland sample plots was 1m×1m, and the method of cutting at ground level was used to dry and weigh the grass samples within the plots, obtaining the dry weight of grass yield within the plots. The total number of sample plots obtained was 475. After strict screening and standardization of the sample plot data before modeling, the remaining sample plots can basically reflect the main grassland types and multi-year grass yield conditions of the representative areas of the sample plots. A total of 442 sample plots were finally selected for modeling and verification, with 400 used for establishing the grass yield estimation model and 42 used for model verification."

The most important rainfall month for grassland yield was October of the previous year; rainfall in April and May of the current year also strongly contributed to grassland yield. The cumulative precipitation from October (previous year) to May in the current year was the main cause of inter-annual variations in grassland yield. The cumulative precipitation in autumn of the previous year and in spring of the current year was a key factor in current-year grassland output."

Grassland sample plots of size 1m×1m are used, where grass is cut at ground level, dried, and weighed to obtain dry weight. A total of 475 sample plots are collected, but only 442 are selected for modeling after strict screening and standardization to reflect main grassland types and multi-year conditions.",

                    "Answer": "Seasonal precipitation patterns influence grassland yield modeling by affecting the inter-annual variations in productivity. The most critical periods include October of the previous year and April to May of the current year. Data collection strategies need to focus on capturing cumulative precipitation during these key months to better understand and model their impact on grassland yield.",
