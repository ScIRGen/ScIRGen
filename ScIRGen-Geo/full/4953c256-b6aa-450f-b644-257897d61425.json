        "AnswerEn": "Inaccuracies in mapping human activities in regions like the Qilian Mountains with diverse ecological restoration efforts may arise from several factors. These include the challenges of differentiating between similar land cover types using high-resolution remote sensing imagery, the potential for misclassification or errors during the visual interpretation of satellite images, and the difficulty in capturing small-scale or subtle changes in land use. Additionally, areas that are ecologically restored might not be easily distinguishable from surrounding land without ground verification, and human-induced changes might not be fully visible from satellite imagery alone.",
        "AnswerCn": "在像祁连山这样的地区，生态恢复工作多样化，映射人类活动的准确性可能会因几个因素而受到影响。这些因素包括使用高分辨率遥感影像区分相似土地覆盖类型的挑战、在卫星图像的视觉解读过程中可能出现的误分类或错误，以及捕捉小规模或微妙土地利用变化的困难。此外，生态恢复的区域可能与周围土地不易区分，缺乏地面验证，而人类引起的变化可能仅凭卫星影像无法完全显现。",

Each plot that shows a change in land use is individually investigated and verified. For plots where imagery analysis is inconclusive, further interpretation and validation are conducted. Ground verification is done for land types that cannot be deduced from imagery alone. The attributes of activities such as mining, illegal housing corrections, new roads, land leveling, and ecological restoration are updated, and the data is uniformly edited to form a comprehensive dataset with spatial resolution of 2 meters and classification accuracy better than 95%.",
