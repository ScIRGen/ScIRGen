            "description": "This is the centennial GPCC Full Data Monthly Product of monthly global land-surface precipitation based on the ~80,000 stations world-wide that feature record durations of 100 years or longer. The data coverage per month varies from ~6,000 (before 1900) to more than 50,000 stations. The Full Data Monthly Product will be updated at irregular time intervals subsequent to significant data base improvements. This product contains the monthly totals on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of  0.5° x 0.5° latitude by longitude. Precipitation anomalies at the stations are interpolated and then superimposed on the GPCC Climatology V2018 in the corresponding resolution (DOIs: 10.5676/DWD_GPCC/Clim_M_V2018_050). The temporal coverage of the dataset ranges from January 1891 until December 2016. \nThe GPCC Full Data Monthly Product is the most accurate in situ precipitation reanalysis data set of GPCC. Moreover it supports regional climate monitoring, model validation, climate variability analysis and water resources assessment studies.",
