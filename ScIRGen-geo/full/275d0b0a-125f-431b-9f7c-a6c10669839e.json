            "description": "The University of Maryland’s Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) Laboratory collaborates with Global Forest Watch (GFW) to provide annual updates of global-scale forest loss data, which are derived using Landsat time series images. Trees are defined as vegetation with a height of more than 5m, and are expressed as \"tree coverage\" as a percentage of each output grid unit. \"Loss of forest cover\" is defined as the disturbance of stand replacement during the period from 2000 to 2016, or the change from a forest state to a non-forest state. \"Forest cover gain\" is defined as the inverse of the loss, or the change from non-forest to forest entirely between 2000 and 2012. \"Forest loss year\" is to decompose the total amount of \"forest loss\" into annual time scales.The first band represents whether a loss has occurred, the second band represents whether a gain has occurred, and the third band represents the year of change.",

By analyzing these patterns, researchers can infer the precision and reliability of Landsat imagery in distinguishing between forest and non-forest states, as well as its ability to capture annual changes in forest cover. This helps in understanding the strengths and limitations of using such satellite data for monitoring large-scale environmental changes.",

This method provides detailed temporal information, enabling differentiation between yearly forest losses and gains. However, the accuracy may be influenced by the resolution and frequency of imagery, as well as the definition of 'tree cover' and 'forest cover loss' used in the analysis.",
