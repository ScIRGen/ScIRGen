            "description": "The Qiangtang terrane preserves an important record of the growth of the Tibetan Plateau since the Mesozoic; however, its deformation and cooling history remain poorly understood. To unravel this issue, we conducted geological mapping in the Esima area and detrital apatite fission-track and (U–Th)/He analyses of the Esima–Rongtang region in the east segment of Central Qiangtang terrane. Our results indicate that the east segment underwent two stages of structural deformation and rapid cooling during 120–110 Ma and 55–38 Ma. By combining our results with those of previous studies of the deformation and cooling history in the west segment, we reconstructed the early spatial and temporal geological evolution of the Central Qiangtang terrane since the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous. The structural deformation and cooling of the west segment at 150–130 Ma was related to northward flat subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang oceanic slab. The structural deformation and cooling of the east segment at 120–110 Ma and the west segment at 110–70 Ma was controlled by oblique convergence between Lhasa and Qiangtang. The structural deformation and cooling of the west and east segments at 55–38 Ma was associated with northward intracontinental subduction beneath the Qiangtang terrane induced by the Indo–Asian collision.",

                    "Answer": "The geological phenomena inferred from the observed patterns of deformation and rapid cooling in the eastern segment during these periods suggest tectonic deformation and rapid cooling associated with structural changes in the region. Specifically, the deformation and cooling during 120~110 Ma can be related to the oblique convergence between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes, while the patterns observed in the period 55~38 Ma are indicative of northward subduction due to the India-Eurasia collision.",

                    "Answer": "Utilizing a dataset that includes detrital apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He analyses can significantly enhance the understanding of tectonic evolution by providing detailed temporal and thermal information about deformation and cooling events. This can lead to a more comprehensive reconstruction of the geological history, such as identifying distinct periods of tectonic deformation and rapid cooling, which are crucial for understanding the spatial and temporal evolution of terranes like the Qiangtang terrane within the Tibetan Plateau.",
