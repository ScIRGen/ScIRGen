                    "Answer": "In the context of geochemical analysis of granodiorite (porphyry), 'δEu and δCe values' refer to specific ratios used to quantify anomalies in europium (Eu) and cerium (Ce) concentrations within a sample. The δEu value is calculated using the formula δEu=EuN/(SmN×GdN)1/2, which involves normalizing europium concentration against samarium (Sm) and gadolinium (Gd) concentrations. The δCe value is calculated as δCe=2Ce/(La+Pr), involving normalization against lanthanum (La) and praseodymium (Pr) concentrations. These values help in understanding the geochemical characteristics and differentiation processes of the rock samples.",

                    "Answer": "In the Chizhou area, the major elements of granodiorite (porphyry) are measured using X-ray fluorescence, while trace and rare earth elements are analyzed using ICP-MS. These methods provide precise measurements and are commonly used in geochemistry due to their accuracy and reliability. Globally, similar methods are often employed for igneous rocks, though variations might exist based on available technology and research objectives. The use of δEu and δCe values for further analysis is a specialized approach that may not be universally applied.",

This includes analysis of the whole-rock δEu and δCe values, which provides insights into the geological processes and conditions that influenced the formation of these rocks.

                    "Answer": "To determine the major elements in granodiorite (porphyry) samples, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is typically used, while trace elements and rare earth elements are analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The analyses are conducted at specialized laboratories, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou ALS Laboratory Group, to ensure data accuracy and reliability. The data's quality is further validated through publication in high-impact scientific journals, confirming its authenticity and reliability.",
