            "description": "1) The data includes the soil erosion modulus of 22 watersheds with a resolution of 2.5 m in the year of 2019 in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 2）Based on the surface layer of rainfall erosivity R, soil erodibility K, slope length factor LS, vegetation coverage FVC, and rotation sampling survey unit, the Chinese soil erosion model (CSLE) was used to calculate soil erosin modulus in 22 watersheds respectively. Through spatial data processing (including chart linking and transformation, vector-grid conversion, and resampling),  R, K, LS factors were calculated from the regional thematic map of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and DEM. By half-month FVC, NPV, half-month rainfall erosivity data, we calculated the value of B factors  in each sampling watershed. The value of E factor was calculated based on the remote sensing interpretation result and engineering measure factor table. The value of tillage factor T was obtained from tillage zoning map and tillage measure table. And then the soil erosion modulus in each sampling watershed was calculated by the equation: A=R•K•LS•B•E•T. The selection of 22 watersheds was based on the layout of sampling survey in pan-third polar region. 3) Compared with the data of soil erosion intensity in the same region in the same year, there is no significant difference and the data quality is good.4) the data of soil erosion modulus is of great significance for studying the present situation of soil erosion in Pan third polar region, and it is also crucial for the implementation of the development policy of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road.",

                    "Answer": "The CSLE model employs specific factors such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), and others to estimate soil erosion modulus. It requires detailed spatial data operations, including converting rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and DEM into sampling unit factors. Comparatively, other soil erosion models may have different data requirements or may not require such detailed spatial data manipulation, potentially affecting accuracy. The CSLE model's accuracy for the mentioned region was validated by comparing it to existing soil erosion intensity data, showing no significant difference, indicating good data quality.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy of soil erosion modulus data collection in small watersheds could be influenced by factors such as the precision of the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) methodology, including the accurate measurement of rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), and vegetation cover (FVC). Additionally, the accuracy of remote sensing interpretations, engineering measures, and cultivation practices play a role, as they affect the input variables used in computing erosion modulus. The spatial data operations, such as raster-vector conversions and resampling, could also contribute to potential discrepancies in data accuracy.",

                    "Answer": "By incorporating multiple factors such as rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length, and vegetation cover, derived from various data collection methods, the dataset allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of soil erosion. This approach can enhance the accuracy and reliability of the assessments by considering the interplay between different environmental and anthropogenic factors, leading to a more detailed evaluation of soil erosion conditions. Additionally, the use of diverse data sources can minimize biases and provide a robust framework for comparing and validating soil erosion intensity with existing regional data, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of soil erosion trends and aiding in policy implementation, such as the 'Belt and Road' initiative.",

It also aligns with broader policy goals such as the 'Belt and Road' development policy, enhancing regional environmental management and sustainability.",

This involves: computing rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness factor (LS) using spatial data operations like raster conversion and resampling for each sampling unit; calculating vegetation cover factor (B) for each land type within the sampling unit based on weighted factors from half-monthly FVC, NPV, and rainfall erosivity; determining engineering measures factors through remote sensing interpretation and engineering measures factor tables; and obtaining tillage factor values through cultivation zoning maps and tillage measures tables. These calculations help in assessing soil erosion conditions across the selected small watersheds.",
