            "description": "The EPMA data set of single mineral of magmatic rocks in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau is mainly based on the main data of single mineral in some areas of the Hoh Xil Lhasa plate, and the single mineral test points are more than 1000. The samples were distributed in Hoh Xil lake, Baohu Lake in South Qiangtang and Narusongduo area in Gangdise. Cameca sxlivefe electron microprobe was used for single mineral electron probe. The data comes from published articles or in the acceptance stage. The data were published in SCI or Ni journals, including American mineralogist and Journal of petroleum. The main testing units are Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Institute of mineral resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The data set can be used to study the petrogenesis of magmatic rocks in different areas of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau.",

                    "Answer": "The data collection using the Cameca SXFiveFE electron microprobe focuses on single mineral major elements from magmatic rocks in specific regions, including Hoh Xil Lake, South Qiangtang Baohu, and Gangdese Narusongduo. This method is considered reliable as the results are published in reputable SCI or NI journals like 'American Mineralogist' and 'Journal of Petrology'. The accuracy and reliability also stem from its application by recognized institutions such as the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry and the Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of specific mineral types like feldspar and olivine for electronic probe analysis in rock samples from regions such as the Tibetan Plateau is influenced by the geological composition of the area, which predominantly includes rocks like olivine pyroxenite, diorite, and granite. The focus on these minerals is due to their prevalence in the region and their significance in understanding the petrogenesis of magmatic rocks. Additionally, the use of advanced equipment like the Cameca SXFiveFE electronmicroprobe allows for precise analysis of these minerals, contributing to reliable data results that are often published in reputable journals.",
