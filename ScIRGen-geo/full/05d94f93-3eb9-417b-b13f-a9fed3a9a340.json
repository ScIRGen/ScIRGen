            "description": "This dataset contains the LAI measurements from the Daman superstation in the middle reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from June 1 to September 20 in 2020. The site (100.376° E, 38.853°N) was located in the maize surface, near Zhangye city in Gansu Province. The elevation is 1556 m. There are 6 observation samples, each of which is about 30m×30m in size, and the latitude and longitude are (100.376°E, 38.853°N), (100.377° E, 38.858°N), (100.374°E, 38.855°N), (100.374°E, 38.858°N), (100.371°E, 38.854°N), (100.369°E, 38.854°N). Five sub-canopy nodes and one above-canopy node are arranged in each sample. \nThe data is obtained from LAINet measurements; the four-steps are performed to obtain LAI: the raw data is light quantum (level 0); the daily LAI can be obtained using the software LAInet (level 1); further the invalid and null values are screened and using the 7 days moving averaged method to obtain the processed LAI (level 2); for the multi LAINet nodes observation, the averaged LAI of the nodes area is the final LAI (level 3).\nThe released data are the post processed LAI products and stored using *.xls format.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) (for sites information), Qu et al. (2014) for data processing) in the Citation section.",

                "Arid and semiarid regions represent approximately 30 % of the global terrestrial surface area (Dregne, 1991; Scanlon et al., 2006), and dryland expansion occurs under climate change, especially in developing countries (Huang et al., 2016). An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

Understanding the basic characteristics of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert ecosystems is important to achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the oasis–desert area and support the ecological security and sustainable development of the oasis. A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."

Half-hourly turbulent flux data were acquired by an eddy covariance system and scintillometer. The hydrometeorological data (including radiation, soil heat flux, and soil temperature profiles; gradients of air temperature and humidity and of wind speed and direction; and air pressure, precipitation, and soil moisture profiles) were observed from automatic weather stations with a 10 min average period as well as the groundwater table data. Moreover, vegetation and soil parameters were also supplemented in the datasets.
