            "description": "Numerical experiments: The climate model used is the fast air sea coupling model (FAMOUS) jointly developed by the British Meteorological Office and British universities The horizontal resolution of the atmospheric model in the FAMOUS model is 5 ° × 7.5 °, 11 layers in vertical direction; The horizontal resolution of the ocean model is 2.5 ° × 3.75 °, 20 layers in vertical direction The atmosphere and ocean are coupled once a day without flux adjustment\nThe tests included the Middle Paleocene (MP,~60Ma BP, test name flat_60ma_1xCO2_sea_3d_ * * 100yr_mean. nc) and the Late Oligocene (LO,~25Ma BP, test name orog_25ma_1xCO2_sea_3d_ * * 100yr_mean. nc) The sea land distribution data is mainly taken from the global coastline basic data set (abbreviated as Gplates, website: http://www.gplates.org/ ）Considering that the initial uplift of Cenozoic terrains such as the Qinghai Tibet Plateau started at about 50~55 Ma (Searle et al., 1987), the global terrain height was set to 0 in the MP test to omit the role of plateau terrain. At 25 Ma, Greenland (Zachos et al., 2001) and the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (for example, Wang et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2014; Rowley and Currie, 2006; DeCells et al., 2007; Polisar et al., 2009) were revised The change of ancient latitude is also considered when reconstructing the ancient topography of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Besse et al., 1984; Chatterjee et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013) At the same time, referring to the change of Cenozoic atmospheric CO2 (Beerling and Royer, 2011), the atmospheric CO2 concentration in the two periods of experiments was 280 ppmv (1 ppmv=1 mg L – 1) before the industrial revolution For simplicity, all land vegetation and soil properties are set to globally uniform values, that is, various land surface properties on each land grid point except Antarctica are assigned to the global average value of non glacial land surface before the industrial revolution, which is also convenient for highlighting the impact of land sea distribution and topographic changes In addition, since we mainly discuss the average climate state and its change in the characteristic geological period on the scale of millions of years, we can omit the influence of orbital forcing, that is, the Earth's orbital parameters are set to their modern values in all experiments\nOutput time: All tests were integrated for 1000 years, using the average results of the last 100 years of each test.\nThis data is helpful to explore the formation and evolution mechanism of the Cenozoic monsoon and drought.",

It is used for simulating atmospheric circulation data with a horizontal resolution of 5°×7.5° in the atmosphere and 2.5°×3.75° in the ocean, with 11 layers in the atmosphere and 20 layers in the ocean. It couples the atmosphere and ocean daily without flux adjustments.",

                    "Answer": "The consideration of global uniformity in land surface characteristics is primarily to simplify the model and highlight the impact of changes in land-sea distribution and topography. By setting all land vegetation and soil properties to a global average value, the influence of these variables is minimized, allowing researchers to focus on the effects of geographic and topographic changes, such as the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, on atmospheric circulation patterns during the specified periods of 60Ma and 25Ma.",

                    "Answer": "Using a uniform value for land vegetation and soil characteristics simplifies the analysis by highlighting the effects of land-sea distribution and topographic changes, while ignoring regional variations in these properties. This approach allows for a clearer examination of the climatic impact of geographic and elevation changes over the million-year scale, but it might overlook localized climatic variations influenced by diverse vegetation and soil types.",

                    "Answer": "The primary goals are to explore the mechanisms behind the formation and evolution of Cenozoic monsoons and aridification by examining the impact of sea-land distribution and topography changes over geological time scales. By simulating atmospheric circulation under these different conditions, the research aims to understand how factors like the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and changes in CO2 concentrations influenced climate patterns, thereby shedding light on the average climate state and its variability over millions of years.",

This model utilizes a specific horizontal and vertical resolution for both atmospheric and oceanic components, with daily coupling and no flux adjustments. The conditions involve setting global topographic heights to zero for certain periods, adjusting for known geological changes, and using pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The integration of global coastline datasets and consideration of paleogeographic and paleoclimatic changes, such as tectonic uplift and CO2 variation, further enable accurate simulations.",
