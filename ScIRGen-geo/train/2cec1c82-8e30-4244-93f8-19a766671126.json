            "description": "Water scarcity，food crises and ecological deterioration caused by drought disasters are a direct threat to food security and socio-economic development. Improvement of drought disaster risk assessment and emergency management is now urgently required. This article describes major scientific and technological progress in the field of drought disaster risk assessment. Drought is a worldwide natural disaster that has long affected agricultural production as well as social and economic activities. Frequent droughts have been observed in the Belt and Road area, in which much of the agricultural land is concentrated in fragile ecological environment. Soil relative humidity index is one of the indicators to characterize soil drought and can directly reflect the status of crops' available water.",

                    "Answer": "The LAI product retrieval method involves using a canopy BRDF model to express canopy reflectance as a function of several parameters, including LAI/FAPAR, wavelength, soil and leaf reflectance, aggregation index, and viewing and illumination angles. Key parameters are established in parameter tables for input into the inversion process. Preprocessed surface reflectance data and land cover data are input into a lookup table (LUT) method to retrieve the LAI products.",

                    "Answer": "The canopy BRDF model represents the canopy reflectance as a function of multiple parameters, such as LAI/FAPAR, wavelength, soil and leaf reflectance, aggregation index, and angles of incidence and observation. This method involves creating parameter tables for key inputs and using a Look-Up Table (LUT) method to invert LAI products. This approach provides monthly temporal resolution and 1 km spatial resolution data, which may offer a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency compared to other techniques not specified here.",

                    "Answer": "The accuracy and reliability of LAI products are influenced by variations in canopy reflectance parameters because the algorithm uses these parameters as inputs to model canopy BRDF. Accurate parameter tables and preprocessing of surface reflectance data are crucial to ensure the precision of the LAI product obtained through the LUT method.",

                    "Answer": "The procedure involves first adopting a canopy BRDF model to represent canopy reflectance as a function of LAI/FAPAR, wavelength, soil and leaf reflectance, aggregation index, and incident and observation angles. Key parameters are established in parameter tables, which serve as inputs for inversion. The preprocessed surface reflectance data and land cover data are then used with a look-up table (LUT) method to invert and obtain the LAI product.",
