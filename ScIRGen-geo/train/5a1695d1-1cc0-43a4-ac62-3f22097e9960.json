            "description": "Global solar radiation at Qomolangma station (The Tibetan Plateau) is measured by radiation sensor (pyranometers CM22, Kipp & Zonen Inc., The Netherlands), and water vapor pressure (hPa) at the ground is measured by HMP45C-GM (Vaisala Inc., Vantaa, Finland). This dataset includes hourly solar radiation and its absorbing and scattering losses caused by the absorbing and scattering atmospheric substances (MJ m-2, 200-3600 nm), and the albedos at the top of the atmosphere and the surface. The above solar radiations are calculated by using an empirical model of global solar radiation (Bai, J.; Zong, X.; Ma, Y.; Wang, B.; Zhao, C.; Yang, Y.; Guang, J.; Cong, Z.; Li, K.; Song, T. 2022.

The observed global solar radiation and meteorological variables are available at https://data.tpdc.ac.cn/zh-hans/data/b9ab35b2-81fb-4330-925f-4d9860ac47c3/.

This instrument is significant in meteorological datasets because it provides accurate measurements of total solar radiation, which are essential for calculating ground solar radiation, atmospheric absorption and scattering, as well as surface albedo and atmospheric factors. The data collected with such instruments are crucial for understanding long-term variations in solar radiation and its interaction with atmospheric substances.",

                    "Answer": "Variability in solar radiation measurements at high altitudes, such as the area around Qomolangma (Mount Everest), can be influenced by several factors. These include atmospheric conditions like water vapor pressure, scattering and absorption of radiation by atmospheric constituents, and reflectivity of the surface (albedo). The use of specific instruments such as radiation tables (CM21) and temperature and humidity sensors (HMP45C-GM) also plays a critical role in data accuracy. Any inconsistencies or calibration issues with these instruments can lead to errors. Additionally, the data collection method involves using empirical models to estimate ground solar radiation and atmospheric losses, which may introduce variations depending on the assumptions and parameters used in these models. The long-term data collection from 2007-2020 helps in understanding these variabilities and refining measurement techniques.",

                    "Answer": "Using empirical models to calculate solar radiation, as opposed to relying solely on direct measurements from instruments like the CM21 radiometer, can lead to variations in data accuracy and reliability. The models may introduce uncertainties due to assumptions and simplifications inherent in their design, particularly in complex environments like high-altitude regions. However, they can also complement the direct measurements by providing estimates in situations where direct measurements are not feasible. This integrated approach can enhance the understanding of solar radiation patterns and atmospheric interactions over a long-term period, as seen in the data collected from 2007 to 2020 for Qomolangma.",

For temperature and humidity data, the HMP45C-GM sensor is employed. The data encompasses measurements of total solar radiation, atmospheric absorption and scattering, top atmospheric and surface albedo, and includes the calculation of atmospheric factors such as ground vapor pressure.
