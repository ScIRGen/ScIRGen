            "description": "This data set mainly includes the results of Zn isotope and trace element analysis of iron rich peridotites and pyroxenites from the central European Bohemian orogenic belt. The samples are from the late Paleozoic. The samples include mg rich peridotite, Fe rich peridotite and pyroxenite. The Zn isotopic data were obtained by MC-ICPMS after acid digestion and ion exchange resin separation, and the trace element data were obtained by ICP-MS after acid digestion. After acid digestion, the trace elements were determined by ICP-MS, separated by ion exchange resin, and then determined by MC-ICPMS.",
