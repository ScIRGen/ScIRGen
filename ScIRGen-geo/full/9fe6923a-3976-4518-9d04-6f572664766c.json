            "description": "This data set mainly includes the non-traditional B-Mo isotopic data of Himalayan Leucogranites, which is mainly used to study the mechanism of B-Mo isotopic fractionation during the melting process, and is of great significance to the genetic study of Himalayan Leucogranites. The rocks are mainly from the granite in the Cuonadong area. Among them, there are 34 Mo samples and 48 B samples, including repeated samples. MC-ICP-MS was used for B-Mo isotopic analysis. ICP-AES and MC-ICP-MS were used for B and Mo contents in solution. The testing unit is Guangzhou Institute of geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data are from accepted articles published in the Journal of geochimica et cosmochimica Acta, and the data are true and reliable. It can be applied to the study of unconventional isotope fractionation and the genesis of magmatic rocks.",

                    "Answer": "The 'B-Mo isotope fractionation mechanism' in the context of studying Himalayan leucogranite refers to the process by which isotopes of boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo) are distributed or fractionated during the melting processes that form leucogranite rocks. This mechanism helps researchers understand the origins and formation processes of these rocks by analyzing how these isotopes behave and change under specific geological conditions.",

                    "Answer": "The selection of MC-ICP-MS and ICP-AES for B-Mo isotopic analysis is likely due to their precision and reliability in measuring isotopic compositions and elemental concentrations. These methods are well-suited for handling the specific isotopic and elemental analysis required for studying the fractionation mechanisms during melting processes in pale-colored granites. Additionally, the established expertise and facilities at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guangzhou support their use for such geochemical investigations.",

The procedure includes preparing granite samples, ensuring accurate B and Mo content via ICP-AES and MC-ICP-MS, respectively. Accuracy is maintained through the use of multiple sample tests, including 34 Mo and 48 B samples with repeated detection to verify results. The data is processed by the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and its validity is confirmed by its publication in Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta.",

These methodologies allow for precise and reliable data collection, crucial for understanding isotope fractionation mechanisms during melting processes.",
