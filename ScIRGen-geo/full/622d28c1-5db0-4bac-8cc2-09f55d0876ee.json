            "description": "The basic principle of ancient recipe analysis based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis method is you are what you eat, that is, the chemical composition of animal tissues and organs is closely related to their diet. Through the detection of isotope ratio of relevant elements, the food structure of ancient people and animals can be directly revealed Then it discusses the research means of people's livelihood and livestock domestication. The collagen of human and animal bones from shilinggang site in Nujiang, Yunnan Province in the southwest of Qinghai Tibet Plateau was analyzed by carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes.",

                    "Answer": "The basic principle behind using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis for reconstructing ancient diets is based on the concept 'You are what you eat,' which implies that the chemical composition of an animal's tissues and organs is closely related to its diet during its lifetime. By analyzing the isotopic ratios of relevant elements, researchers can directly reveal the food structures of ancient humans and animals, thereby exploring the methods of studying the livelihoods of ancient peoples and animal domestication. Collagen from bones and enamel proteins from teeth are analyzed because they are less likely to be contaminated during burial and can maintain their structural integrity. Their protein amino acids and elemental composition and content are relatively stable, making them the primary focus for ancient diet analysis.",

                    "Answer": "The need for using stable isotope analysis of bone collagen arises from the principle that the chemical composition of an animal's tissues is closely related to its diet during its lifetime. This method allows researchers to directly reveal the food structure of ancient humans and animals, thereby exploring livelihoods and domestication practices of past societies, particularly in regions like the Tibetan Plateau where skeletal collagen and dental enamel proteins can maintain their structural integrity over time.",

                    "Answer": "Applying carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis on ancient human and animal bones can reveal detailed insights into the dietary patterns and subsistence strategies of ancient populations. By examining the isotope ratios in bone collagen, researchers can infer the types of foods consumed and the trophic levels of those foods. This information can further illuminate ancient human interactions with their environment, the domestication and management of livestock, and broader socio-economic structures within ancient communities. Additionally, the stability of collagen and enamel proteins in archaeological contexts allows for a reliable reconstruction of past diets, contributing to our understanding of human adaptation and cultural practices over time.",
