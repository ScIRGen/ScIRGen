            "description": "The data set contains the flux observation data of scintillator with large aperture from sidaoqiao station downstream of heihe hydrometeorological observation network.There are two groups of large aperture scintillators at the downstream sidaoqiao station.On the east side (point 1), there is a large aperture scintillator of model BLS900. The north tower is the receiving end and the south tower is the transmitting end. The observation period of BLS900_1 is from March 13, 2014 to December 31, 2014.On the west side (no. 2 point), there is a large aperture scintillator of BLS900 model. The north tower is the receiving end and the south tower is the transmitting end, and the observation time of BLS900_2 is from January 1, 2014 to November 8, 2014.The station is located in ejin banner of Inner Mongolia, the underlying surface involves tamarisk, populus populus, bare land and cultivated land.The latitude and longitude of the north tower of point 1 is 101.147e, 42.005n, and that of the south tower is 101.131e, 41.987n.The latitude and longitude of the north tower at point 2 is 101.137e, 42.008n, and the latitude and longitude of the south tower is 101.121e, 41.990 N, with an altitude of about 873m.The effective height of the large aperture scintillation instrument is 25.5m, the diameter length of LAS at point 1 is 2390m, and that of LAS at point 2 is 2380m, and the sampling frequency is 1min.\nLarge aperture flicker meter raw observation data for 1 min, data released for 30 min after processing and quality control of data, including sensible heat flux is mainly combined with the automatic meteorological station observation data, based on similarity theory alonzo mourning - Mr. Hoff is obtained by iterative calculation, the quality control of the main steps include: (1) excluding Cn2 reach saturation data (BLS900_1: Cn2 > 7.25 e-14, BLS900_2: Cn2 > 7.33 E - 14).(2) data with weak demodulation signal strength (Average X Intensity<1000) were eliminated;(3) data at the time of precipitation were excluded;(4) data of weak turbulence under stable conditions were excluded (u* < 0.1m/s).In the iterative calculation process, for BLS900, the stability universal function of Thiermann and Grassl, 1992 was selected.Please refer to Liu et al.(2011, 2013) for detailed introduction.\nSome notes on the released data :(1) the data of LAS point 1 in the downstream is mainly BLS900_1, and the missing moment is marked by -6999;LAS data of downstream point 2 is mainly BLS900_2, and the missing moment is marked by -6999.(2) data table head: Date/Time: Date/Time (format: yyyy-m-d h:mm), Cn2: structural parameters of air refraction index (unit: m-2/3), H_LAS: sensible heat flux (unit: W/m2).The meaning of data time, such as 0:30 represents the average between 0:00 and 0:30;The data is stored in *.xls format.\nPlease refer to Li et al.(2013) for hydrometeorological network or site information, and Liu et al.(2011) for observation data processing.",

One-source evapotranspiration estimation models combine the soil–vegetation components into a single source. However, in real landscape conditions, the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistance to energy exchange. Therefore, one-source models explicitly cannot estimate the surface evapotranspiration accurately because the effect of.",

Water vapor and heat meet over the reference height in the interior of the canopy. Moreover, the mixed water vapor and heat can only exit through the top of the canopy; the total heat flux is in addition to the fluxes coming from every surface layer. However, the model is complex, having over five resistances that cannot be accurately calculated. In addition, the model includes required parameters and observations that cannot be readily obtained from operational satellite- and ground-based data; therefore, the range of applications of the model is limited.",

Because the TSEB model only requires the surface energy balance model with a single measurement of land surface temperature, the original model and subsequent refinements have been widely used to estimate E and T under a wide variety of vegetation types, vegetation coverage, climates, and spatial scales. However, most studies have only evaluated the total fluxes or ET (soil plus canopy) in comparison with measurements using the Bowen ratio–energy balance system, the eddy covariance (EC) system, or the large aperture scintillometer.",

The previous sensitivity studies found that the TSEB model performance is mainly affected by the uncertainty in surface–air temperature difference. Sometimes, this difference is dominant due to the errors in determining the surface soil and vegetation component temperatures from the surface composite radiometric temperature. In this letter, it is shown that there is an overestimation of the component temperatures compared with the observed composite radiometric. This often leads to the most crucial effect on the TSEB model performance. In addition, another factor is the strong advective environment in this region."

The higher uncertainty of H estimation is not only caused by the uncertainty of the TSEB model but also due to the increased uncertainty of the EC system, which is 18% when the mean H is small in the irrigated farmland. Due to image pixel classification errors, soil pixels were counted as vegetation pixels, which produced an overestimation of the canopy temperature under the developing vegetation abundance. Alternatively, ignoring atmospheric upwelling radiation and transmittance could have produced the uncertainties in the estimated temperatures. In addition, the estimated uncertainty of the incoming short- and long-wave radiation transmittances through the canopy may be another source of Rn estimation errors."

The estimated E/ET% and E/ET% values agreed well with the values observed using the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes technique during the early, middle, and late growing seasons.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015).
