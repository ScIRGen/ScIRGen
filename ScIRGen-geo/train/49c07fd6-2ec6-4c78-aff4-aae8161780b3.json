            "description": "The MODIS Terra MOD09A1 Version 6 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Terra MODIS Bands 1 through 7 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the seven 500 m reflectance bands is a quality layer and four observation bands. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used.Based on MCD12Q1 data from 2001 to 2016, MatLab was used to tailor the masks of 18 key nodes in Southeast Asia and middle East. Finally.\nThis dataset is based on the data of MOD09A1 V6 synthesized in 8 days from 2001 to 2016 downloaded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The spatial resolution is 500 meters, and MatLab is used to mask cut the data in the research area, and Finally, the land cover data of 18 key nodes from 2001 to 2016 were obtained..\nThe 18 key regions covered by the data mainly include: Bangkok, Port of Myanmar, Chittagong, Colombo, Dhaka, Gwadar, Hambantot, Huangjing and Malacca, Kwantan, Maldives, Mandalay, Sihanouk, Vientiane, Yangon, etc.).",
