            "description": "The data set includes the observation data of river water level and velocity at No.2 point in the runoff densification observation of the middle reaches of Heihe River from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. The observation point is located in Heihe bridge, 312 National Road, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The riverbed is sandy gravel with unstable section. The longitude and latitude of the observation points are N38 ° 59 ′ 51.71 ″, E100 ° 24 ′ 38.76 ″, with an altitude of 1485 meters, and a channel width of 70 meters and 20 meters. Sr50 ultrasonic range finder is used for water level observation, with acquisition frequency of 30 minutes. The data description includes the following parts:            For water level observation, the observation frequency is 30 minutes, unit (CM); the data covers the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014; for flow observation, unit (M3); for flow monitoring according to different water levels, the water level flow curve is obtained, and the runoff change process is obtained based on the observation of water level process. The section of bridge no.2-312 is frequently disturbed by human beings, and the unstable area of hydrological section leads to the disorder of water level and flow curve. During the measurement, the stable flow and water level curve cannot be obtained. The missing data is uniformly represented by string-6999.            \nRefer to Li et al. (2013) for hydrometeorological network or station information and he et al. (2016) for observation data processing.",

We established a sparse network to investigate the oasis-desert interaction. One superstation was constructed within the oasis, and four EC towers and four two-layer automatic meteorological stations (AMSs) were installed in different landscapes surrounding the oasis, including sandy desert, desert pavement, desert steppe, and wetland. Intensive observations were implemented at the irrigation district scale.

An oasis is a unique ecological landscape in arid and semi-arid areas that is not only the core of regions’ ecological environment but also the foundation of their economic development, especially in western China, which has been an important part of the “Silk Road” since ancient times. Oases comprising less than 10 % of the total area of arid regions support more than 90 % of the population in these regions of China (Chu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2022). The oasis–desert system plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable ecological environment and agricultural productivity (Zhang and Zhao, 2015). Extensive studies have investigated energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas based on field and remote-sensing observations (Taha et al., 1991; Potchter et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022) and numerical simulations (Chu et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2009; Georgescu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020). In addition, oasis–desert areas located in semiarid regions have been found to be carbon sinks by previous researchers (Tagesson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019); thus, they can significantly affect the carbon balance of arid regions and play an increasingly important role within the global carbon cycle."

A quantitative understanding of the energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange in oasis–desert areas is crucial to recognize the oasis–desert interactions and is significant to protect the ecological stability and socioeconomic development of oases; moreover, long-term observations are indispensable."
