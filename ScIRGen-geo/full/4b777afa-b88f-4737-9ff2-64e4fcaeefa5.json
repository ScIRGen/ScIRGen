                    "Answer": "The prescribed climatology of SST from 1981-2010 in a dataset indicates that the methodology involves using a historical baseline of sea surface temperatures to provide a consistent reference point for the hindcast experiments. This approach allows researchers to isolate the effects of atmospheric variations by maintaining a stable oceanic boundary condition. It also highlights the use of historical observational data to inform climate model simulations, which is critical for understanding and predicting climate dynamics over the specified periods.",

                    "Answer": "The choice to use a climatology computed from HadISST over the period 1981-2010 is likely influenced by the need for a consistent and reliable sea surface temperature dataset that captures long-term average conditions, which helps to reduce biases and variations in the atmospheric model simulations. This period provides a stable reference point, allowing researchers to isolate the atmospheric response to land surface processes without the confounding effects of interannual SST variability.",

This involves using the sea surface temperature data as a constant boundary condition to simulate atmospheric conditions over a specified period. The accuracy is maintained by using ensemble mean files from a 30-member hindcast, which helps in reducing uncertainties and improving the reliability of the model outputs. The process ensures that the data reflects historical climate conditions accurately during the May-June period for the years 1993-2014.",
