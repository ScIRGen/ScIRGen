            "description": "The dataset of the truck-mounted dual polarized doppler radar observations (time-continuous 10-minute on the 250m×250m horizontal grid) was obtained in the arid region hydrology experiment area from May 20 to Jul. 5, 2008. The observation site (38.73°N, 100.45°E, 1668m) was typical of complex underlying surface and transit zone landscapes. \n     The aim was to explore and retrieve precipitation type and intensity by radar in cold regions, with the precipitation particle drop size analyzer and ground intensive measurements occurring simultaneously, thus making it possible to produce a high resolution precipitation dataset. \n     The 714XDP X-band dual-linear polarization Doppler weather radar was with a horizontal resolution of 150 m, an azimuth resolution of 1, VCP from 10-22 layers and the scanning cycle 10 minutes. ZH, ZDR and KDP could be acquired together. For more details, please refer to Readme file.",

It can measure various polarization information like ZH, ZDR, and KDP, which are crucial for exploring methods to jointly observe and invert ground precipitation type and intensity in high-cold areas. The radar has specific performance metrics, including a radial resolution of 150m, azimuth resolution of 1, and can perform volume scans ranging from 10 to 22 layers with a scanning period of 10 minutes.",
