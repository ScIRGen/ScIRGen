            "description": "The matching and zoning of water and land resources in Central Asian countries under the background of climate change can provide support for the development of water and land resources and agricultural production in Central Asian countries, and is of great significance to the social stability of the core region of the Silk Road Economic Belt. Based on the collected meteorological, water resources, land use and remote sensing data, the present situation of water and land resources development and utilization in Central Asia is analyzed. Based on the evaluating the characteristics and shortages of agricultural soil and water resources, using the DPSIR model and the theory of supply and demand, we constructed the index structure framework (SDCSL) of the study area, and the principal component analysis and cluster analysis are used to divide the regional of water and land resources utilization. Finally, we discussed the measures and ways to achieve the effective matching of agricultural water and land resources in different regions, so as to provide scientific reference and theoretical basis for the effective matching and sustainable development of regional agricultural water and land resources.",

                "Central Asia is one of the regions in the world where ecological problems caused by the development and utilization of water and soil resources are most prominent. Located in the heart of the Eurasian continent, Central Asia has a temperate continental arid climate with limited precipitation, making water resources a limiting factor for its economic and social development. The large-scale development of water and soil resources during the Soviet era led to ecological issues such as the shrinking of the Aral Sea, desertification, and soil salinization, which have attracted widespread attention from the international community. Since the independence of the five Central Asian countries, extensive research has been conducted from various levels and perspectives on issues such as the allocation and utilization of transboundary river water resources, the impact of global changes on water resources in Central Asia, water resource demand forecasting, and the management of water quantity and quality. It is generally believed that the root of the water problem in Central Asia is not the lack of water quantity, but rather a crisis in management. The spatial mismatch between water resource formation areas and consumption areas often leads to water use conflicts. Accurately evaluating the formation and consumption of water resources and their spatial matching with other resources is a prerequisite and foundation for the optimal spatial allocation of regional water resources."

It quantitatively analyzes the matching status of water and land resources in each country and identifies the key issues related to water in the Central Asian region."

            "challenges": [

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the water conservancy facilities and water resource allocation system were retained; however, compensation measures for water and energy between upstream and downstream countries have not been implemented. The inter-industry conflicts in the original water conservancy facility utilization system have escalated into inter-state conflicts, and the contradictions in the development and utilization of water resources have become increasingly prominent between countries and different water use sectors. The rational allocation and utilization of water resources have become a focal point of concern for all countries."

Then, based on the amount of water resources per unit area of cultivated land, it calculates the water-land resource matching coefficient for each country and specifically analyzes the matching status of water and land resources in each country. The calculation of the water-land resource matching coefficient R is conducted using the method based on the amount of water resources per unit area of cultivated land, and the natural breaks method (Jenks) is used to classify the matching status of water and land resources in the Central Asian region into five levels."

However, there are significant differences among the five Central Asian countries, with upstream countries exhibiting better matching conditions than downstream countries. Furthermore, through quantitative analysis of the matching status of water and soil resources, it is concluded that the water issues in Central Asia are not merely a matter of quantity; the core issue lies in the utilization and distribution of transboundary river water resources between countries, especially between upstream and downstream nations. Using the Gini coefficient calculation method, the regional Gini coefficient G = 0.3256 based on the available water resources indicates that the matching status of water and soil resources in Central Asia is at a relatively reasonable level, suggesting that as a whole, the water and soil resources in Central Asia are balanced or can be balanced through allocation, and the quantity of water resources is not the decisive factor in the water issues of Central Asia."
