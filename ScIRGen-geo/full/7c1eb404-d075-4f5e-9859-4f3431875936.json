            "description": "The data content mainly includes the main and micro data of the whole rock of magmatic rocks in the Himalayan orogenic belt. The sample distribution areas mainly include Jilong, banrong, xiaru, Laguigangri, Yadong, Yala shampoo and nangabawa. The rock samples are mainly Cenozoic leucogranite, Paleozoic granite and Cretaceous diabase, with a total of 408 pieces. Light colored granite is widely developed in the Himalayan orogenic belt, which is a typical representative of S-type granite and has been written into the textbook of petrology. Recently, Nb, Ta, Li, be and other key metal elements have been found in the Himalayan leucogranite, with great metallogenic potential of rare metals. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the petrological and geochemical characteristics and formation mechanism of Himalayan Leucogranites is of great significance not only for understanding the Himalayan orogenic belt itself, but also for defining the formation mechanism, deep dynamic process and ore forming potential of Leucogranites in other collision orogenic belts in the world. However, in order to deeply understand the tectonic evolution process and environmental resource effects of the Himalayan orogenic belt since the Cenozoic, we need to deeply understand the tectonic processes that the Himalayan terrane may have experienced before the collision, and further determine the material composition of the Himalayan orogenic belt. Paleozoic granite and Cretaceous diabase are important rock components of the Himalayan orogenic belt. They are probes to explore the possible tectonic processes experienced by the Himalayan terrane before collision. The mineral composition and geochemical characteristics show that the Paleozoic granite is peraluminous high K / Na granite, which has higher FeO and MgO and lower Al2O3 compared with the Cenozoic leucogranite; It has a low CaO / (MgO + FeO * + TiO2) ratio and falls into A-type granite, which is formed by partial melting of argillaceous rocks under extensional background, with the addition of mantle materials. Regional data are mainly from published articles or being accepted. XRF spectroscopy was used for the determination of major elements and ICP-MS was used for the determination of trace elements. The data quality is highly reliable, and the testing units include the national experimental testing center of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences. The data are published in high-level journals, including LITHOS, Journal of rock, etc.",
