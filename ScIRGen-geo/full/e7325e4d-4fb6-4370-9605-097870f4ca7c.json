            "description": "This dataset contains the flux measurements from the mixed forest station eddy covariance system (EC) in the downstream reaches of the Heihe integrated observatory network from January 10 to December 31 in 2023. The site (101.1335° E, 41.9903° N) was located in the Sidaoqiao County, in Ejina Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region . The elevation is 874 m. The EC was installed at a height of 3.2 m, and the sampling rate was 10 Hz. The sonic anemometer faced north, and the separation distance between the sonic anemometer and the CO2/H2O gas analyzer (CSAT3B & Li7500DS) was 0.17 m.\nThe raw data acquired at 10 Hz were processed using the Eddypro post-processing software, including the spike detection, lag correction of H2O/CO2 relative to the vertical wind component, sonic virtual temperature correction, coordinate rotation (2-D rotation), corrections for density fluctuation (Webb-Pearman-Leuning correction), and frequency response correction. The EC data were subsequently averaged over 30 min periods. The observation data quality was divided into three classes according to the quality assessment method of stationarity (Δst) and the integral turbulent characteristics test (ITC): class 1-3 (high quality), class 4-6 (good), class 7-8 (poor, better than gap filling data), class9 (rejected). In addition to the above processing steps, the half-hourly flux data were screened in a four-step procedure: (1) data from periods of sensor malfunction were rejected; (2) data collected before or after 1 h of precipitation were rejected; (3) incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing data constituted more than 10% of the 30 min raw record. There were 48 records per day, and the missing data were replaced with -6999. Suspicious data were marked in red. The water vapor density data were rejected when the negative values occurred. \nThe released data contained the following variables: data/time, wind direction (Wdir, °), wind speed (Wnd, m/s), the standard deviation of the lateral wind (Std_Uy, m/s), virtual temperature (Tv, ℃), H2O mass density (H2O, g/m3), CO2 mass density (CO2, mg/m3), friction velocity (ustar, m/s), stability (L), sensible heat flux (Hs, W/m2), latent heat flux (LE, W/m2), carbon dioxide flux (Fc, mg/ (m2s)), quality assessment of the sensible heat flux (QA_Hs), quality assessment of the latent heat flux (QA_LE), and quality assessment of the carbon flux (QA_Fc). In this dataset, the time of 0:30 corresponds to the average data for the period between 0:00 and 0:30; the data were stored in *.xls format. Detailed information can be found in the suggested references.\nFor more information, please refer to Liu et al. (2018) and Liu et al. (2023).",

                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance method is a key atmospheric measurement technique used to quantify the exchange of gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. It involves the use of sophisticated instruments like an ultrasonic anemometer and gas analyzers to measure vertical wind speed and gas concentrations at high frequencies, typically at 10Hz. These measurements are then processed to calculate half-hourly fluxes, accounting for corrections such as time delay, coordinate rotation, and density effects. The method provides insights into ecosystem metabolism, energy balance, and climate interactions.",

                    "Answer": "The eddy covariance system specifically measures the exchange of gases, such as CO2 and H2O, and energy fluxes between the forest surface and the atmosphere with high temporal resolution (10Hz raw data processed to 30-minute intervals). This method provides continuous and direct flux measurements, whereas other meteorological methods might focus on different parameters, such as temperature or wind speed, without directly measuring fluxes. The eddy covariance approach also includes various corrections and quality checks to refine data accuracy, which might not be as comprehensive in other methods.",

These steps help ensure that the resulting 30-minute averaged data is more accurate and reliable for analyzing surface processes. Additionally, the quality evaluation of each flux value, including atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity checks, and the filtering of data based on criteria like instrument errors or high data loss rates, further enhance the data's usefulness and validity for research purposes.",
