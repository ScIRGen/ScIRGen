            "description": "Sentine-1 SAR data were used to monitor the permafrost of Biuniugou in Heihe River Basin of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Based on the Sentine-1 SAR image of Bison Valley from 2014 to 2018, the active layer thickness in the study area was estimated by using the small baseline set time series InSAR (DSs-SBAS) frozen soil deformation monitoring method based on distributed radar target, combined with SAR backscattering coefficient, MODIS surface temperature and Stefan model. The results show that the thickness of active layer is between 0.8 m and 6.6 m, with an average of about 3.3 M. It is of great significance to carry out large-scale and high-resolution monitoring.",

                "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the highest and largest permafrost distribution area in the world at mid to low latitudes, with an existing permafrost area of approximately 130×10^4 km², accounting for about 56% of the total area of the plateau. In recent years, there has been a significant warming trend on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, leading to notable degradation phenomena in permafrost, such as thickening of the active layer, shrinking of its range, and thinning of its thickness. The moisture within the active layer of permafrost continuously transitions between solid and liquid states with temperature changes, causing frost heave and thaw settlement in the soil layer, which results in widespread ground deformation in permafrost areas and severely damages major engineering infrastructure in the region. Additionally, changes in the active layer affect the hydrogeological conditions in permafrost areas, impacting surface runoff and water resource regulation functions of cold region rivers, thereby influencing regional hydrological processes and the ecological environment. Therefore, to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of permafrost degradation on human engineering activities and regional sustainable development, it is of great significance to conduct large-scale, high-resolution monitoring of the thickness changes in the active layer of permafrost areas."

In order to further improve the density of natural surface DSs points and the quality of time-series deformation estimation, new generation DSs-InSAR methods represented by SqueeSAR technology and its variants have gained significant attention in recent years, as they can effectively address the shortcomings of PS-InSAR and SBAS methods. The proposed method has great application potential in large-scale freeze-thaw monitoring and active layer thickness inversion studies in the permafrost region of the Tibetan Plateau."

                "Currently, monitoring methods for observing surface deformation in the field, such as leveling, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and inclinometers, have advantages like high precision and ease of deployment. However, they require on-site installation and have sparse monitoring points, making it difficult to effectively conduct large-scale and long-term monitoring of ground deformation in permafrost regions. PS-InSAR only performs interferometric analysis on strong scatterer targets (such as artificial buildings and exposed rocks) that are not affected by temporal and spatial decorrelation, and there are very few Persistent Scatterers (PS) in permafrost areas, resulting in observational results that do not objectively reflect the overall changes in the study area. Generally, the signal-to-noise ratio of Distributed Scatterers (DSs) in permafrost regions is relatively low, which affects the reliability of deformation monitoring results. The identification of DS points and phase optimization calculations are very time-consuming, and when the number of SAR images is limited (usually less than 25 scenes), the significance of hypothesis testing is not high."

We also estimated the seasonal deformation amplitude using the Stefan model in conjunction with ground temperature data.

The larger seasonal deformation amplitudes in the region are mainly concentrated in the mid to lower reaches of the sub-clay bottom areas, with a maximum of up to 6.0 cm. The time series of permafrost deformation in the area mainly shows a cyclical change with a period of one year, starting to melt around early March each year and reaching the maximum thaw depth by the end of September; from early October, it begins to freeze again, reaching the maximum value by mid-January and continuing until early March."
