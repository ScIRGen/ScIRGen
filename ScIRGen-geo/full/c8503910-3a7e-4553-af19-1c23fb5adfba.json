The product is generated on a regular grid of 0.05°×0.05°, spanning from 2001 to 2018.\n3) Data quality description: the accuracy is better than that of ERA5 reanalysis data.\n4) Data application achievements and prospects: the database can be used to study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of near-surface air temperature of Antarctic ice sheet, and the impact of SAM and ENSO on the interannual variation of Antarctic temperature. In addition, the dataset has the potential application for climate model validation and data assimilation due to the independence of the input of a numerical weather prediction model.",

                "As a central component of the cryosphere, the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) plays a very important role in the global climate system. Near-surface air temperature is one of the most fundamental factors in the Antarctic system, and its variations affect not only the mass variations of the ice sheet itself, but also the ecological environment, biochemical processes, and species diversity of the surrounding sea areas (Herbei et al. 2016; Convey et al. 2018). From the 1957/58 International Geophysical Year (IGY), a lot of efforts have been put into direct meteorological observations across the Antarctic continent. However, most of the stations are located at the edge of the ice sheet, with only two stations in the interior. Thus, sparseness of observed data is a primary challenge when investigating spatial and variability of temperature over the AIS. Although significant progress has been made to improve climate models including atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) and limited area models (LAMs) for polar regions, AGCMs do not adequately represent the effect of topography on air temperature due to their coarse resolution, and the LAMs suffer from the lack of high-quality forcing data at their boundaries, leading to relatively high uncertainties of the simulations. Thanks to the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, thermal infrared remote sensing images, which can provide spatially continuous data at a high resolution, have become an important tool to determine global surface skin temperatures."

As a result, it is challenging to represent climate information of the vast Antarctic interior well by relying only on the existing stations. However, the extremely harsh environment (e.g., extreme temperatures and winds) in Antarctica usually results in intermittent gaps of AWS measurements, and hence long-term records are also scarce. Moreover, most of the AIS is still undocumented by AWS observations. AGCMs do not adequately represent the effect of topography on air temperature due to their coarse resolution, and the LAMs suffer from the lack of high-quality forcing data at their boundaries, leading to relatively high uncertainties of the simulations."

A three-layer neural network fitting model is constructed to reconstruct the near-surface temperature field of the Antarctica by using the temperature data from 119 meteorological stations and the corresponding grid data from the MODIS dataset. First, nearest neighbor interpolation is used to extract the preprocessed MODIS LST at the corresponding station locations. The MODIS LST values are matched with the corresponding station records. The input layer integrates and passes information to the hidden layer; each neuron in the hidden layer summarizes the information of the previous layer and transfers it to the output layer through nonlinear activation function. After finishing the neural network training process, the remaining 60% observations are used to verify the reliability of the established quantitative statistical relationship between monthly station air temperature and MODIS LST."

Furthermore, the performance of the reconstruction is better than ERA5 (the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis model) against in situ measurements.

Limited area models (LAMs) also suffer from this issue due to the lack of high-quality forcing data at their boundaries, leading to relatively high uncertainties in simulations.",
