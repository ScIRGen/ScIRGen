MYH10, a key gene for atherosclerosis, will be obtained through DEGs screening, weighted gene co expression network analysis, construction and analysis of protein protein interaction network, function enrichment analysis and GSEA analysis Spearman and Pearson rho tests were used to compare the differences in intima-media thickness (IMT), MYH10, and α - SMA expression, and correlation analysis was performed. Using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to determine MYH10 and α- Sensitivity and specificity of SMA in predicting AS. Using Cubic Spline Interpolation Algorithm to Analyze MYH10 and α- SMA expression and the high-risk warning range of AS. Adopting Swiss model（ https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ ）Construct a α - SMA protein model.
