            "description": "The basic data set of remote sensing for ecological assets assessment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau includes the annual Fraction Vegetation Coverage (FVC), Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau since 2000, and other ecological parameters based on remote sensing inversion. The FVC data are mainly developed from MODIS NDVI data. Based on pixel dichotomy model, the vegetation coverage model is developed by using multi-scale remote sensing images, combining with high precision remote sensing parameters such as vegetation community type and distribution characteristics, and the mixed pixel decomposition method is used to construct the vegetation coverage model. All data could be used only after the permission of the data distributor.",

This involves using MODIS NDVI data as the primary source, applying a pixel binary model, and integrating multi-scale remote sensing images with high-precision parameters such as vegetation community types and distribution characteristics to develop a vegetation coverage model. The method also involves constructing the model through mixed pixel decomposition, with a reported RMSE of 0.21 when comparing estimated values to actual measurements, acknowledging a certain tendency for overestimation in sample values ranging from 0 to 0.5.",

These models, constructed using methods like mixed pixel decomposition, can provide more accurate estimates of Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) by integrating various scales of data and detailed ecological parameters. The accuracy is validated through a comparison of estimated values with measured values, where the RMSE is documented as 0.21, although some overestimation is noted in sample values between 0-0.5.",
