                    "Answer": "The need for radiometric correction, calibration, and geometric coarse correction arises due to noticeable radiometric distortion in raw data from scanning imaging sensors like OMIS-II, as well as the unstable spatial relationship between adjacent pixels caused by changes in aircraft attitude. Radiometric correction is performed using moment match methods to eliminate non-uniformity, strip noise, and smile phenomena, while radiometric calibration uses pre-flight laboratory-measured calibration coefficients for accurate unit conversion. Geometric coarse correction relies on POS data collected synchronously with the images to reconstruct flight strip images and significantly improve visual quality.",

                    "Answer": "Applying radiometric correction, calibration, and geometric correction to airborne imaging spectrometer data can significantly improve the data's accuracy and quality by reducing radiometric distortion, correcting non-uniform radiometric response, eliminating strip noise and smile effects, and enhancing the visual quality of images. Although these processes address issues such as aircraft attitude changes and unstable spatial relationships between adjacent pixels, the data may still require fine geometric correction using control points to ensure compatibility with other georeferenced datasets.",

                    "Answer": "The preprocessing of airborne imaging spectrometer data involves several key steps including radiometric correction using the moment match method to eliminate radiometric response non-uniformity, striping noise, and smile phenomenon. Radiometric calibration is carried out using pre-flight laboratory measured calibration coefficients with units of W/(m^2·sr·um). Geometric coarse correction utilizes POS data to reconstruct flight strip images, significantly improving visual quality. After geometric coarse correction, geometric control points are used for geometric fine correction to integrate with georeferenced data. It's recommended to use the central, unobstructed part of the images for analysis due to potential obstructions at the scan line edges.",
