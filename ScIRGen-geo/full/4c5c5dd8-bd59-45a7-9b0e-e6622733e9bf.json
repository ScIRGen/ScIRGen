            "description": "As the basis of ecosystem material and energy cycle, net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation can reflect the carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation at regional and global scales. It is an important indicator to evaluate the quality of terrestrial ecosystem. Aiming at the production of net primary productivity products of vegetation, based on the principle of light energy utilization model and coupling remote sensing, meteorological, vegetation and soil type data, the modeling of ecosystem productivity in national barrier area was studied. In terms of parameter selection, the photosynthetic effective radiation (APAR) is calculated from the spot/veg etation NDVI satellite remote sensing data, China's vegetation map, total solar radiation and temperature data; Compared with the soil water molecular model, the regional evapotranspiration model can simplify the parameters and enhance the operability of the model. Taking photosynthetic effective radiation and actual light energy utilization as input variables of CASA (Carnegie Ames Stanford approach) model, the net primary productivity of land vegetation on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau with a resolution of 1km from 2000 to 2018 was estimated based on the parametric model.",

Measurements on primary productivity in specific areas can quantify the input of organic matter to food webs, and so are of critical ecological importance as well. A quantitative assessment of the ocean’s primary productivity (the rate at which carbon dioxide is reduced to organic matter by marine phytoplankton photosynthesis) is a critical variable in understanding the ecology and biogeochemistry in marine systems. Phytoplankton, being the base of marine food webs, grow at different rates in the ocean, rates that are regulated by temperature, nutrients, and irradiance; they are in turn grazed by herbivorous organisms that both incorporate the autotrophic organic matter into their own tissues, as well as recycle it by oxidizing a portion for energy use and release."

Annual productivity calculated from the means throughout the growing season equalled 146 g C m-2 yr-1. Mean chlorophyll concentration in the euphotic zone (the 1% irradiance level) was 2.85 ± 2.68 mg m-3 (maximum concentration was 19.1 mg m-3). Maximum photosynthetic rates at the surface (normalized to chlorophyll) averaged 0.94 ± 0.71 mg C (mg chl)-1 h-1, similar to the maximum rate found in photosynthesis/irradiance measurements. Productivity measurements are consistent with the temporal patterns of biomass found previously, with biomass and productivity peaking in late December; mixed layers were at a minimum at this time as well. Estimates of plankton composition also suggest that pre-January productivity was largely driven by the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica, and summer productivity by diatoms."
