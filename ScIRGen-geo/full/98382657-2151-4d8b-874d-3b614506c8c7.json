            "description": "This data set comes from shallow marine carbonate sections at Tingri and Gamba, south Tibet. The age of these samples is about 56 Ma (at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary). At Tingri, we studied two parallel sections (13ZS section and 10-11TM section), and at Gamba, we studied one section (11TMG). From the 13ZS section, we analyzed carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions and calcium carbonate content of the whole carbonate rock, as well as the in-situ carbon isotopic compositions and element contents of the foraminifera shell. From the 10-11TM section, we analyzed carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopic compositions of the whole rock. From the 11TMG section, we analyzed carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the whole carbonate rock. Carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the whole rock were measured by gas isotope mass spectrometer (MAT251), strontium isotope by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), calcium carbonate content by acid dissolution, in-situ carbon isotopic compositions by SIMS, and in-situ element contents by LA-ICPMS. Among these data, in-situ carbon isotope data were obtained from the laboratory of Professor John Valley at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States, and the rest are from the relevant laboratories of the Department of Geosciences at the University of Bremen in Germany. Based on these data, we published three peer-reviewed papers on Journals of Gondwana Research, GSA Bulletin, and Global and Planetary Change.",

                "The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is one of the most pronounced global warming events in the Cenozoic. This event was associated with a large negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) and with major changes in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. About 56 m.y. ago, global temperature rose rapidly by at least 4–5 °C, and this temperature anomaly persisted for ~170 k.y. This event, now called the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), was associated with severe carbonate dissolution on the deep-sea floor and with a ~2–7‰ negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), indicating a massive addition of 13 C-depleted carbon into the atmosphere-ocean system. The CIE was documented by diverse substrates from different depositional environments, ranging from paleosol carbonate, tooth enamel, plant lipids, soil organic matter on land to foraminifera, bulk carbonate, and marine organic matter in the ocean. Therefore, the CIE reflects a global geochemical event, and not a regional carbon perturbation. Along with the PETM-CIE, dramatic changes took place in the ocean-atmosphere system, such as a marked increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, intensified seasonal precipitation and weathering, abrupt reversal of deep-ocean circulation, rapid ocean acidification, and increased ocean stratification. In different ecosystems, fauna and flora showed variable responses to this warming event. On land, insect herbivory increased sharply as floral composition changed from mixed gymnosperms and angiosperms prior to the PETM to almost exclusively angiosperms during the PETM. Many mammals became smaller, and migrated from Asia to North America. In the tropical surface ocean, reef-building corals retreated to middle latitudes, planktonic foraminifera diversified rapidly, and calcareous nannoplankton experienced increased rates of origination and extinction. In the deep ocean, smaller benthic foraminifera suffered one of the largest extinctions in the Cenozoic with the loss of ~30%–50% species. Despite substantial progress in the PETM studies, how larger benthic foraminifera (LBFs) in the shallow Tethyan Ocean responded to the PETM is still debated."

In summary, we construct a LBF biostratigraphy, pinpoint the P/E boundary in the SBZs, and discuss the LBF response to the PETM."

                "Unfortunately, it appears that some studied sections from Spain and Egypt do not meet these requirements, because they either comprise non-marine sediments or contain reworked LBFs in the stratigraphic interval close to the P/E boundary. Thus, even for some fully marine carbonate sections with in situ LBFs, whether these sections are “complete” on millennial time scales and have preserved carbonate sediments produced in this geologically brief time interval is also vital to the precise designation of the P/E boundary and to understanding of the LBF response to the PETM."

For δ13 C and δ18 O analyses, samples were cut to expose their fresh surfaces. On their fresh surfaces, diagenetically less-altered micrites and LBF fragments were carefully micro-drilled under a light microscope. About 20 g of material was obtained from each sample and then ground to powder in an agate mortar. For δ13 C and δ18 O measurements, ~100 µg of rock powder were reacted with phosphoric acid at 75 °C in an automated carbonate unit. The isotopic composition (δ13 C, δ18 O) of the resulting CO2 was measured with a Finnigan MAT 251 gas isotope ratio mass spectrometer at the MARUM, University of Bremen."

At the P/E boundary, no evident compositional change in LBF assemblages can be observed. However, a major compositional change in LBF assemblages occurs in the CIE recovery, characterized by the sudden disappearance of Miscellanea, Ranikothalia, Setia, Orbitosiphon, and the initial dominance of porcellaneous-walled Alveolina and Orbitolites together with small miliolids and rotaliids."

A geologically rapid event characterized by profound changes in biotic evolution, climate and geochemical cycling occurred at the Paleocene-Eocene transition.

Then, we use data of Sr and Mn concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr ratios to exclude the possibility of diagenetic alteration. By comparing the background δ13C_carb values at Tingri with the background δ13C values of mixed-layer foraminifer Acarinina from different ODP Sites, we confirm that the δ13C_carb records from the shallow epicontinental sea of the Tingri area can reflect the carbon cycling in the open surface ocean.
